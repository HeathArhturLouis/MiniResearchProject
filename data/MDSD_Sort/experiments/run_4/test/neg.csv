 Overall I am disappointed in this volume, Hush Returns.  I collect all Batman Graphic Novels, and this is distinctly the least successful of any I have read in the last year or more.  It does not compare to Loeb's original "Hush" collection, or continue on from the conclusion reached in that collection. Do not buy it expecting a third part to the Hush story.   Most graphic novels tell a tale (albeit sometimes with an open ending or as part of a series) that follows a story arc.  You have your traditional introduction, the bulk of your story, and then your conclusion. "Hush Returns" has no conclusion, the ending is far from satisfactory.  It's not all bad - the art is good, and some of the characterisation is quite enjoyable.  The timeline is interrupted by the happenings in "Under the Hood", which doesn't make it easy for the author.  I was shocked to see the Joker's backstory introduced, and didn't at all like the humanisation of Joker - which is very much at odds with his portrayal elsewhere in the DC Universe (ie as an inhuman maniac).  Having said all that - it's a Batman Graphic Novel, so if you're a Bat-fan, you'll probably buy it anyway.  Just don't expect brillance, and you won't be disappointed. 
 It's really sort of a trip back in time reading this book...so much of it probably worked pretty well in 1985 when this was written but the translation in 2004 doesn't quite make it. Trendy young Dr. Delaware, age 33, drives a Cadillac Seville and when it's disabled he rents a "boxy Japanese car". Lot's of amusing things crop up like that in this book which actually made me sort of nostalgic. I had to go listen to old Hall & Oates LP's to re-visit "Say It Isn't So" and "Maneater" again! It also has a central convention of the 80's that I'm currently sick to death of...struggling,impoverished minorities-Good Guys, White, affluent successful Christian Men who conspire-Bad Guys. Honestly, this formula is more stereotypical than "The Butler Did It" used to be. If you spot a successful white guy early in a story, especially if it's suggested that he's a Christian, he's probably the bad guy. If Kellerman wrote this book in 2004 it probably couldn't get published...it's way too formulaic! Consequenly a big part of my dislike of this book is because of this. It doesn't stop there however...many reviews here suggest that Jonathan Kellerman is a great writer. I think he's marginal at best. I think these characters are really pretty shallow and the whole idea of this psychologist single handedly solving crimes and beating up bad guys twice his size is goofy. Delaware points a gun at central villians on 2 separate occasions in the story and they admit to everything but their shoe size. Try to imagine Patrick Kenzie or Harry Bosch pointing a gun at a bad guy and having said bad guy collapse and outline every last element of the crime in great detail. It reminded me of those old Perry Mason shows where Perry always seems to get a witness to break down in open court and admit to his or her crime in front of a packed court room. Here's a suggestion: if you want to read a good mystery with child abuse as a theme read Dennis Lehane's "Gone Baby, Gone". Jonathan Kellerman should be writing scripts for TV detective shows...like Barnaby Jone 
 I have tried again and again to appreciate Wait's songs as so many people have pushed him on me. This is the latest, and my last attempt. I have come to realize that I am no fan of shtick in music, and Waits has built an entire career out of shtick. If you like the gimmick run with it, if you're curious I would advise running in the opposite direction, with haste 
 2 1/2 stars  For the most part many of these songs demonstrate the colder, more distant aspects of pop songwriting, however warm the "vibe" would have us believe, with their autopilot musicality and predictable tunes. On the few songs that do feel more inspired then the generic majority, it is definately possible to see future pop majesty this band is capable of achieving, albiet it in a watered down farmiliar way to anyone who has ever picked up an older Belle and Sebastian album, whose shadow will hopefully prove underwhelming on future releases.   
 Shipping took way too long to get here, almost 14 days. They probably could have chosen a better option to send it, but didn't 
 I bought this book after reading Immerso's wonderful and insightful book about his hometown of  Newark, New Jersey. His new book on Coney Island was not at all what I expected. It's more like a book report than a book, consisting of bits of information taken from previous Coney books spliced together with trivia from web sites. There appears to be no primary source material or original research. Immerso repeats the traditional Coney Island stories, weaving them into a dry narrative that will be interesting only to someone who is not familiar with Coney Island. The modern color photos are not very good and seem to be used as filler. Overall, Coney Island: The People's Playground is a pedestrian effort by a good writer 
 I was very surprised and dissapointed to find so many biblical references in a book with such a title 
 My son loved this toy at christmas, however in less than an hour it was broken. The gears had stripped on one side, and it never made it out of the house.  Now, amazon.com was very good in saying they would send another...I sent the broken back...but the toy was on back order until April, 06.  I waited, at the request of my 8 year old son who wanted it so badly...the time came and went...the only way I knew what was going on was by my contacting them...they never bothered to let me know of any problems with the order...but always apologetic.  I finally asked for a refund in April because they told me it was still not available....now I'm stuck with the battery pack that doesn't go with anything else....and after reading all the other reviews, I wouldn't chance getting another one, even though my son did love it.    
 What a disappointment this book is. For one is very poorly written. Blair Jackson is simply too much of a fanboy and too little of a writer with this particular book. Its presents itself as a biography of Garcia and far too many times it drifts off into a simplistic Deadhead's review of Garcias various tunes. Way too many pretentious references to Hunters lyrics and really his put downs on Weir and other members (thinly veiled but non the less put downs) reek of Garcia worship. He finds no faults in any Garcia tunes and plays up his ballads (which were often low points of Dead shows) like they were the shimmering representation of all that is the Grateful Dead.  He also glosses over many aspects of Garcias personal life, which is silly for a biography. There are more reviews of Hunter and Garcia tunes then there are facts presented about the man the book is about. If its something that can be said without bringing up anything critical then Jackson carries on about it, but if its a low point then he will place a sentence or at most a paragraph. Garcia is a complex man and his biography should have been more complex. I dont want to read another book chiming in with English 101 poetry reviews, I wanted to read a book that chronicled Garcias life in an unobstructed manner. Jackson turned out to be way too much of a fanboy of Garcia to make an effective book. 
 The books main focus is the history of armor.  If you are looking for a guide on how to make armor this is not the resource you want 
 I think this book promotes an unhealthy expectation of marriage. The author's only defense is to keep repeating "Why are you so defensive?" when he mentions his ideas. As a married woman, I think it is important for couples to have space, other friends, and the freedom to enjoy life in whatever way makes them happy. This does not take energy away from a marriage- it gives more energy to it.  He says that you shouldn't joke or ask advice or basically have any conversations with anyone of the opposite sex because you should be saving all your conversations for your spouse. Well maybe my spouse doesn't get those kinds of jokes or doesn't know the subject I'm asking about. I'm supposed to deny those parts of me. I'm supposed to have a boring time at work and not talk to anyone. He must be a pretty dull person to not have enough conversation for more than one person, because I can talk to a coworker, and (gasp) I can still have a conversation with my husband when I get home!  Let's say you like to play chess and your spouse does not. Are you supposed to give up playing chess, or is it so horrible to play chess with someone outside your marriage? You won't be able to get your spouse to be everything you want, and it's not good to believe that you can change someone into what you want. I do have friends outside my marriage. I even have male friends.  My husband does not care. You know why? Because he's not pathetically insecure like this author. It's not wrong to have coffee with a coworker. I think it's more wrong to be so controlling that you find a cup of coffee to be a betrayal. It is immature to think that every time you smile at someone it could lead to an affair, or that you can relate to your spouse in every way and don't need anyone else.  The idea that spending time with someone else takes energy away? That sounds a little cultish to me, as if you have to focus 100 percent of your time and attention. You're having marital problems, so the solution is to stop having friends or pleasant conversations with coworkers? That's supposed to make you happier? I suppose he thinks if two people don't get along, you should lock them in a room together and suddenly they'll be in harmony. I don't think so! They'll probably be ready to kill each other! Maybe it works for him, but I don't think it's anywhere near working for every couple. For many it will be forcing something that just doesn't fit.  I think that if you shut yourself off from the world, you may be more likely to want out. You could feel more isolated and if it doesn't work out, you won't have anyone to turn to. I think this book also gives fuel to anyone with pathological jealousy. He even admits that he doesn't shake hands with other women. He says he is a rabbi, but he sounds like he'd be more comfortable in an Islamic Fundamentalist society where men and women are kept separate. 
 I personally started liking Tim Robbins from Shawshank Redemption & Sean Penn from Dead Man Walking and I believe these were the movies these guys should have recieved oscar for their outstanding roles.  Keeping than in mind and seeing lot of recommendations I saw Mystic River which the review said was the best as far as Clint Eastwood was concerned Again he had adapted another movie, Bridges of Madison County, which in my personal opinion was much better adaptation of a novel.  The story line eventhough is good about three friends meeting again by fate and all the script is not that strong. I actually fell asleep in between. Off the cast my personal belief is Kevin Bacon was really good. Sure Tim  Robbins plays a character of sexually abused child with lot of conviction but even that was potrayed better in Shawshank Redemption where he is abused by a few inmates. And the end is kind of loose.  Give it a mis 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 Oh, man, this is rough. The debut was OK, the second was middling sophomore slump, and now, this third one is just ghastly - a real mess and a total letdown. What glimmer of talent on display on the first record has been replaced by flat, tuneless, and totally bland riffs in search of song structure and hooks that never come. Did you see the lead singer try to "sing" on SNL?  Sadly, he looks cool in his para-military peacoat and touseled rockstar hair, but the guy cannot carry a tune, for real. Out of key yelping is a understatement. Just painful to listen to.  Why bother?  Make this CD a coaster 
 I gave this album 2 stars because this is apparently the same band that produced "Logic Will Break Your Heart", although you would never know this by listening to "Without Feathers".  As other people have noted, this album is infinitely different than the amazing "Logic Will Break Your Heart".  I fell in love with "Logic..", and when this album came out I was first in line to pick it up. After a thorough listen, I examined the packaging.  I thought, "Did I buy the wrong cd?  Dear God, please, did someone accidently place a different cd in this case?"  But, to my dismay, it was The Stills.  Say what you want about this album, but I don't see how anyone who really felt "Logic..." could be anything but disappointed in this album.  I've tried examining it from a different angle.  I've given it a "fresh listen".  Nothing.  I got the same feeling from this album that I got after I watching "Star Wars: The Phantom Menace".  What happened to the magic, man? 
 All I can say is pass me some aspirin. This is a dozy of a bad novel. As it says on the dust jacket, a Supreme Court law clerk grabs a petition and ends up becoming deceased. Its up to the brother to uncover the truth by finding the real killer who had let a poor black man rot away for a crime he did not commit. At the same time the brother contends with mysterious bad guys out to get him and stop the unearthing of the evidence. Not only does he deal with his family, but his brothers friend, a sexy young law clerk herself and the duplicity on the bench she works for.  And that's only the start of the plot.   Its really pretty bad, it descends into mired pretensions and goofy resolutions. The characters are so shallow that you are left with little notion of who they are except for a faint nasty after taste over their conceded ways. Baldacci is along with James Patterson and Dean Koontz one of America's worst authors. If you want an author who writes on a similar vein to this, try one of Harlan Coben's last four or so stand alone thrillers with out the character Myron Bolitar in it. Or for a more sophisticated read, look for Denis Lehane, he wrote the amazing Mystic River, but his PI series located in Boston is pretty good as well. 
 A nice read for an afternoon of boredom, it won't knock you senseless or render your silent; you can read it and stop at any given time. This is an OK story with a twist of mystery and hidden treasures (given this case the copy of the Declaration of Independence).  Our main characters are Roxanne Royeaux (aka ex Sports Illustrated swimsuit model) and Steve Serrano (aka lover of history / bartender who is writing a book about the story of the copy of the Declaration of the Independence - allegedly stolen from Jefferson by a Mr. Portner).  As you can imagine, these two fall in love at first sight though neither of them will accept this until of course, it's kind of too late and they have bruised the other one's heart. The storyline is predictable and although Fox has touches of creative wisdom like the incident at her new restaurant where her cat Cheeto leaves the Kitchen like a hell house with hairs all over the dishes carrying fresh and decorated French delicacies and ruins her chance at a first good review in the New York Post.... There is also the scene with P.B. (aka Pretty Boy / cop and charmer who is a chauvinistic macho all the way kind of guy) being the one behind the break- ins but there is not much substance here and not a real lesson or pearls of wisdom either.  If you are looking for a book of depth and lessons learned, you are not on the right track.... but if you are out here looking for just entertainment while you bathe or lay in the sun, well here is a book for you.  
 I've read a lot of Ludlum books but this book is so totally "off" in terms of technical authenticity and detail that anyone who understands a little about computers, etc. should stay away - it is just to difficult to read when you can't respect the knowledge of the authors 
 I really enjoyed The Perfect Storm.  So, I gave Ms. Greenlaw the benefit of the doubt and started her book.  I was less than impressed.  I lasted till page 53 where I just ran out of patience with her plodding technique and her lack of story. This is a bad book attempting to ride on the tail of Junger's book.  Sebastian Junger's blurb on the cover was "Anyone who loves the sea will love this book"  I think not 
 Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101.  In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison 
 considering that sex should be about as interesting a topic as there is, it really is amazing how so many writers can make it sooooo dull. are orgies really about as interesting as roofing a house? reading this author, it sure seems like it. what a disappointment this book was. not once did i achieve wood status while reading it. horrible. horrible. horrible. about as bad a book as i've ever read 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 Ronald Kessler's INSIDE THE CIA is among one of the worst books I've ever read, and the worst detailing the Central Intelligence Agency.  The material presented by Kessler is hardly informative, and never thought-provoking.  Rather, the book is a cluttered, rambunctious compilation of CIA facts merged with Kessler's own commentary which, at times, entirely invalidates his initial claims.   Kessler spends one chapter depicting a CIA director as having been detrimental to the agency at critical times, and justly explains why.  However, at the end of the same chapter, he spontaneously introduces his own commentary which contradicts his previous portrayl of the director.  For three pages, he actually has the audacity to violate his role as an author and instead become a self-propelled menace to his own writing.  Commentary in such books should elaborate on the research presented, and address the author's authentic view; not a repetitive rambling on information.  Furthermore, INSIDE THE CIA is poorly written.  Kessler provides facts in short burts of words, sometimes in the most illiterate fashion.  At times, Kessler repeats the same facts and commentary, sometimes within the same paragraph on the same page.  Therfor, the book becomes irritating to read.  While the book pretends to illustrate the internal workings of each directorate in the CIA, Kessler spends the shortest of chapters on the Directorate of Science Technology, and provides absolutely noththing.  The extent to which he describes this directorate is common sense; such as the utilization of satellites; spy devices, etc.  He never describes either of those in detail.    Kessler's book succeeds with one function: presenting facts or views on the CIA that are already well known, or just common sense...  There are plenty of books on the CIA, and I suggest you buy one that's more informative by an author that knows how to write. 
 I received the coffeemaker as a gift, and was relatively happy with the machine, though coffee could have brewed a bit hotter.   However, within a year I noticed that the thermal glass lining in the carafe began flaking off. Like a fool, I just bought another one even though I probably could have gotten it replaced under warranty.   Well, another year or so later, I'm washing the new carafe by hand (as recommended with warm water, no extreme temps or abrasives), and set it down to dry. About 5 minutes later I hear a loud pop, and go back to find a pile of glass shards all over my counter and floor. Carafe #2 bites the dust (thankfully my kids weren't around).  And, in reading through other Amazon reviews of the coffeemaker, it appears my exploding carafe is not uncommon.  Regrettably, I (like about 80%+ of consumers) failed to keep the receipt, and was roadblocked by the overly apologetic yet useless call center folks armed with finely scripted objections & rebuttals. No receipt, no luck, can't help you. Yes, they were happy to help if I had a proof of purchase -- and would be happier to refer me to parts to buy another one. Beyond that though, well, nothing.   They even gave me the name of the person at the next level up who apparently only responds in writing though (Can I have that job?).   Hmm...."Bold design, precision, ingenuity and unwavering craftsmanship uniquely define the philosophy of the company Robert Krups began in 1846".   I'd say Robert's philosophy has gotten lost somewhere, unless he meant that the product's planned obsolescence should be equal to the warranty period.   Don't buy it, unless you plan to replace it every year. 
 This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen.  This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't.  It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us.  After watching this movie I felt incredible stupid and regret being apart of a culture that could make such main stream trash.  my only hope is that our european friends didn't seen this for it would most certainly cause an international incident 
 No one is entitled to an explanation for the title of this review. Let me paint the landscape: Me. The mirthfully masochistic misanthropic malcontented misfit. Standing, grinning, at the base of a volcano due to erupt. The volcano is Ketchum's "Peaceable Kingdom". The seconds tick by...The moment is at hand!! The volcano roars! The natives flee! I stand, fixed, arms outstretched, inviting the scalding dread to ensue, to envelop, my underweight form....and am doomed to discover the uncomfortably cool, clammy caress of yogurt.   This fella ain't Bentley Little. Unsurprising mall-walking through shopping plazas of familiar plotlines and cliched material doesn't cause the pulse to quicken and bubble. "The Box" appealed to me--the boy who didn't want to eat--but the other stories are snoozefests. Sorry, Ketchum--I'm still awake and I'm still waiting for the fire of a good short story to ignite within you. 
 This book will tell you nothing about "history". It reads more like a novel and uses a series of literary devices which do violence to the material it deals with. Human history is not a story - why should it be, it doesn't have an "author". Real rubbish 
 This timer worked for approximately two weeks. We noticed it had failed because the appliance did not go on as programmed. After many attempts to reset it, we decided to return it and report is as damaged so that it had to be removed from the merchant's inventory 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 The Unbearable Lightness of Being was considered an unfilmable novel for a good reason: the point of Kundera's writing is not his plot - or even his characters - but his style.  For instances, his endless digressions about history, politics, and philosophy.  For the movie, we are left with nothing but plot and character.  OK, what is one to do?  That in itself wouldn't be so bad if I didn't watch the film with the constant thought: I could read the book in less time than it takes me to watch this movie.  This is a SLOW film.  It takes an hour-and-a-half story and takes three hours to tell it.  I can't recommend the film 
 My first Philippa Gregory book was "The Queen's Fool"  which I throughly enjoyed.  I could not waited to have time to sit and read!  So as I was towards the end of "The Queen's Fool" I began to see what other books were available by this author.  I bought "The Virgin's Lover" since to seemed to follow "The Queen's Fool".  Within the first 36 pages, I was completely frustrated at the layout of the novel.  TOO MUCH BOUNCING ABOUT WITH THE TIME FRAME.  And the time frames within the book do not match those in "The Queen's Fool".  For instance, in "The Queen's Fool"  Queen Mary dies in Winter 1558 but in "The Virgin's Lover" The Queen dies in Autumn 1558.  Another example is Lord Robert.  In "The Queen's Fool" Lord Robert lives at St. James Palace (Autumn 1558) and presses Queen Mary to name an heir (Winter 1558).  However, in "The Virgin's Lover" Lord Robert is low man in court with no where to go but to his wife's StepMother's.                                                                   I think part of the problem with this type of time framing is the use Seasons.  Winter 1558....is this November December or January February?  Because further in the book the use of Winter 1558-59 is used. The back and forth at the beginning of the book set me up to confusion a few later chapters into the book.  I spent more time concentrating on keeping the time frame correct then actually enjoying the book which must be quite evident by now with me taking the time to write this review 
 I am a soldier in Iraq, and I thought you could play it on a regular DVD player or computer, I was wrong.  Dont buy any HD movies if you do not have an HD DVD player already 
 As a civil war history buff, this book was a little disappointing.  The stories were not well written and the publisher overlooked some pretty bad grammar/spelling errors.  I read about two of the stories and put it down and have no interest of picking it up again.  There are definitely better books out there!  Dont bother with this one 
 Isn't very tasty.  Falls apart when taking a bite.  Not recommended.  
 This book has basically ruined my life. I no longer will hold to a man's standard just because he wrote a book about his personal experiences. Very old fashioned. This book does not apply to the general population of people who are Christian. This book is not recommended for people 21 and up. This is basically a childish, immature kind of book only meant for youths. Zero stars 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 This is a book of pleasantries for people who are easily influenced and can't think about what they're reading.  "Find the positive!" it says.  If your life is hell, look at the pretty shiny fire.  The author makes points that range from valid but unhelpful to contradictory and moronic 
 For anyone interested in detecting lies in the marketplace, politics, and marriage: this is the last book you should buy.  Slight exaggeration aside, there are probably 3 semi-valuable pages in this book.    Ekman spends about 275 pages trying to convince you that even if you believe someone is lying, you might be wrong...or, actually, you may be right...The entire book is a dizzying succession of tautologies.  He is so scared that you will read his hypotheses (which are of no practical value - who can spot a "micro-expression" without buying his $50 software and training on it for a month?) and accuse an innocent person of lying (or vice versa) that he has rendered this book useless.  If you are a masochist and are interested in reading a book where an insecure researcher talks to himself for hundreds of pages, by all means buy this book.  There IS a reliable protocol for detecting lies, and there are at least a couple of books that I know of that go over it in detail, in less than 200 pages.    
 This Was Joe Walsh in his Prime, when he was really Rockin' If your A james Gang fan, and you like live music, you really should own this "CD"!  (Joe at some of his best!!!) 
 I recently purchased this book, trusting the recommendations on this site, and after reviewing the book I am sorely disappointed. The book doesn't give a tremendous amount of information in individual essential oils, it dedicates nearly three times the amount of pages to Dr. Young's exclusive blends, and how to use them. Additionally a lot of content is dedicated to telling you why every other oil is inferior to the Dr. Young oils, which came across as nothing more than a marketing ploy to sell his oils. I've used other oils, such as John Steele oils - which are EXCELLENT quality - and have had no negative effects from it.  Another thing I found quite alarming is his recommendation to use essential oils neat, including ones known to be irritating or caustic to the skin. The "Raindrop technique" is extensively discussed which any respectable aromatherapist knows is incredibly hazardous and likely to cause burning or injury to the skin.  There is some generally good information given about individual oils, like the range of which chemicals should be in each oil, however, nowhere does he explain what each of these components do, and no where does he talk about how these various components act on the brain chemistry. He also doesn't explain how various oils can counteract each other in the brain chemistry through inhalation, something critical if EO's are to be used in mood alteration, altering brain function or the like.  If you plan on using the Young Living oils, then this book would be of great help, but if you don't, I think the book is mostly advertising for his oil line and won't be of much use to you 
 The world's biggest bear has nothing new to say. You'd be better off with books from someone who practices what they preach. If you pay for cable or a dish to get CNBC, you're already losing money. Don't waste any more 
 How can you explain somone sacrificing a once great mystery franchise and his own reputation to make a few bucks with this literary swill?  I fell in love with this series around 1990 with Catskill Eagle and immediately read everything to that point and since. The original plots were dynamic, the characters interesting and developed and I would stay up all because I flat couldn't put them down.  This book is embarrasing, I'm not even convinced he actually wrote it, he may have handed it off to some unimaginative teenagers to cobble together a Spenser novel. OR maybe he had Popeye write it (original title "I YAM WHAT I YAM!"). The dialogue with Susan is EXCRUCIATING & simplistic beyond words. And what's with the double spacing, 3 words to a line and 2 1/2 pages to a chapter? If this was typed out like a real novel, I think it would be about 25 pages! After 16 years I AM DONE! [... 
 This book is the worst of all the others  he tries to hard to explain and is ver difficult book to read i do not recomend it. 
 The entire first half is devoted to physical beauty as it was viewed in the 50's 
 I ordered this book having loved some other for dummies books.  Thank goodness I ordered several other saltwater tank books.  As I was picking through each of them I noticed that the for Dummies book contained information that completely contradicted the others!  I was so angry at the wrong information in this book that I sent it back at a $5.00 loss.  I'm actually considering checking some of my other for dummies books for errors.  Yes, the language is simpler than in other books, but the amount of wrong information is not worth the cost of the book.  Buy this if you want to kill some fish 
 "Nonsuch" is one of those records that I think was doomed to failure-- having constructed (with a little help from Todd Rundgren) a thematic song cycle ("Skylarking") and an album of perhaps the best pop music in two decades ("Oranges & Lemons"), the bar was set pretty high for XTC, and in an attempt to reach it, they seemed to have overreached a bit.  It's not that the album is bad per se, it's just so carefully arranged and produced to have lost the edge that made its predecessors so great.  The band seems to have distilled themselves down to midtempo numbers, occasionally finding a bit of a driving electric sound (opener "The Ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead"), but largely sticking to a quieter, balladry style, often primarily piano driven.  Sometimes it works out quite nicely, the lovely, chirping staccato guitars on "Humble Daisy" provide ample support for a simply fantastic lead vocal by Andy Partridge, and certainly the lilting off-rhythm of "Then She Appeared" is downright captivating, but more likely than not, the pieces end up blending one into another as pretty much unmemorable pop songs that are inoffensive and ok but just not attention getting (Colin Moulding's "My Bird Performs", Partridge's "The Disappointed").  To cap things off, the album stretches over an hour long, and by the end of the record, even the more intriguing material ("The Ugly Underneath") seems to blend in with the rest.  It's tough though, becaue none of it is particularly bad, and in fact, all sorts of neat stuff is going on throughout-- great three part harmonies (Brian Wilson style with a falsetto over the top) catch the ear on "Dear Madam Barnum", "Wrapped in Grey" twists and turns every which way, "War Dance" features an intriguing clarinet opening that leads into a set of reeds providing support for Moulding's venomous lyrics... it goes on.  In fact, with such detailed arrangements, everything's guaranteed to be interesting in some regard, but what it lacks is that feeling of spontaneity and energy.  One nice thing is that at least with this reissue and its remastered sound, you can make out the subtleties of the record nicely.  Bottom line, there's a lot better by XTC-- "Nonsuch" is an ok record, but they've done a whole lot more 
 This book is very detailed and has many well points the help rise the level of your game. It is good to read but it didn't help me when I actually went to the table 
 I didn't understand it, don't know what it's about and frankly i don't care. what are people thinking when they make tripe like this. what a waste 
 Just from perusing the online pages, the author is just babling.  If this is presented as fantasy, fine; otherwise let's have some facts besides the statement, "Sorry, guys.  That's the way it is! 
 This is a cute bubble machine. But honestly it isn't the most well made toy at all. The handle becomes defective and stays down. The solution leaks from the bottom and you don't get much bubbles coming out of the product 
 Once that plastic part breaks  ... its over. I can not find a replacement part for it. Otherwise nice can opener 
 I am a huge fan of Linda Howard's books. I have purchased each and every one of them. I live in Israel so getting her books in English from the U.S.A. isn't cheap Cover of Night was the most disappointing book of Linda Howard's I have ever read. It was boring and I foung myself turning the pages and looking for something interesting to read in that particular book. I hope the next one is more interesting. I will keep looking forward to her books since I have enjoyed and re-read many of the ones I have

 I looked at the package for Romancing the Stone Special Edition today and saw that the movie was widescreen but was not anamorphic (not enhanced for widescreen televisions).  If the information on the package is accurate, then Fox did not make the release very special.  This is a good movie, but I would suggest waiting until an anamorphic version is released 
 Dawes starts with the conclusion he wants to prove, and then selects only studies which agree with it.  We call this begging the question, or affirming the consequent.  He ignores myriad studies, including those conducted by NIMH, which prove that Cognitive Therapy IS effective.  Dr. Aaron Beck and Dr. Albert Ellis have pioneered new forms of therapy.  To dismiss them out-of-hand is short-sighted 
  	Do you like a book with lots of excitement and adventure?  Then Secrets of a Civil War Submarine is not for you.  Secrets of a Civil War Submarine is an informational book about one of the first submarines, The Hunley, and it shows you how the ship works, all of the crew members, and all of the boring missions.  Maybe it sounds interesting to you, but to me it is very boring.  The only thing that won't keep you from falling asleep is the part where you figure out why the submarine sank.  At the end it shows you what they think the crew looks like, and artifacts that were found, and the secrets that the captain kept.  If this sounds like the book for you then read it.  But I do not like this book, and I do not recommend it.     
 I really liked the movie "the Hours", loosely based on this book, so I thought I'd read it... I couldn't get through it.  I love many classic books, but I'll not try another by Virginia Woolf 
 I HATE THIS TOY! IT JUST SITS THERE DOING NOTHING! I ONLY RECOMMENED IT TO A MINDLESS KID! AND I MEAN MINDLESS 
 I normally do not review books, but I feel so strongly negative towards this one.  The book is very dry - there is an example at the beginning of each chapter to serve as a motivation, but other than that, the examples are very plain. In addition, he does not give enough material to work all of the problems. The examples are very basic and full of horrid notation. There are a lot of holes in the logic as well.  A plus side is that the algorithms are not difficult to implement with only a few notational quirks to deal with (but none of them have detailed explanations).   From a student's perspective, you should steer clear away from this one 
 I bought this book looking for a quick guidebook on writing, but what I found was a elementary schoolbook. I would not reccomend this book unless your writing skills are horrendous. It is just plain boring and does not give any usefull tips in my opinion 
 This "Tea Cattle" is absolutely adorable.  It is not practical for daily use.  The spout doesn't pour cleanly and water ends up all over the stove.  The lid doesn't remove easily and more often then not knuckles will be knocked on the handle that does not move.  
 puddle of mud the nirvana of 2000 god these guys try to be tough hiding behind distorted and swearing and wearing their caps backwards OWWWW big men i can't cope with it killing me i think i'm gonna wet my pants at how lame this band sounds after their hit single "she hates me" has drifted away..and it's replaced with more media twoodle which will get the clones with their hoodies and chains in their pockets and baggy trousers going crazy and wetting their pants NOT COOL NOT ROCK AND ROLL AT ALL  are puddle of mudd really trying to re-vive grunge that they have to rip off all the riffs of the great bands i.e pixies, screaming trees etc  another band that nicks stuff just like oasis  hell i had to wind up the oasis fans aswell  i hate puddle of puke  avoided buy anything by the pixies, screaming trees the cult before this  only if your a ten year old hoodie year clone then you will think it's the greatest album ever made  well i'm a 19 year old and i think it sucks!!!!!!!!! 
 I had such high hopes for this novel.  I loved "This Present Darkness" and "Piercing the Darkness".  They had thrilling plots and great messages about the power of prayer and God's grace.  But what a disappointment this was.  I only made it about half way through before putting it down. I was turned off immediately from the subtle but definitely present right-wing conservative agenda.  I tried to put that aside and just concentrate on the story, but the slow pace and dull characters made that difficult.  At one point Peretti actually writes that an abortion clinic would falsely tell a woman she was pregnant just to get her money for an abortion.  The real miracle is that Peretti can still write with his head that far up his butt.  If you believe in the right-wing views of the media, homosexuality and abortion then you will like this book, because that's what this book is really all about 
 I have read on Hypothyroid and this is not the book I was looking for, as to help me to speed up my metabolism.  I would like to find a book that just is plain and gives examples of diets and foods to eat.  Disappointed... 
 I found this such a lot of junk.  So sorry I ordered it. phylli 
 The authors of this book are key personalities of the American Botanical Council, an organization tirelessly committed to the takeover of herbal medicine by pharmaceutical companies, specifically German pharmaceutical companies that generously fund their company--and underwrite the production of their books. If you care about herbal medicine, don't give your money to this sinister organization

 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 Loved The Magus.  Kept waiting for this one to take off.  Save for the one chapter on his first love - about three-quarters of the way through - I found little worth hanging onto.  Great observations about L.A. and the  film biz.  Colorful  descriptions of English countryside and the Nile  Delta.  But, sorry, none of it worth the 600+ page plod 
 HOOGIE MANE FACE UR FACTOR FOR ON JUST DROP SHY CHINAMAN UP TO  DANC 
 In reality, it's not an awful book.  In fact, there are quite a number of things which can be filed under the "good to know" category.  However, I'm so bitter at paying such an outrageous price for this book that I simply cannot bring myself to give it anything more than a very poor rating.  Don't bother, there are better (and more reasonably priced) sources 
 I agreed with the overall idea of the book - that not teaching children old-fashioned good behavior and respectful attitudes leads to trouble, and that substituting TV and material things for parents' time and involvement leaves children empty.  But, he hands down some strong opinions on the specifics of how to care for children that I think are harsh and incorrect.    The book states over and over again how important it is to bond and attach with a young child, but then he is unsupportive and even critical of practices that many families have found encourage this bonding - breastfeeding, feeding a baby on demand (aka when they are hungry !), and sharing sleep.  I promise, it is possible to raise a respectful, grateful child even after breastfeeding on demand and co-sleeping as a baby !  He is also very hard on working mothers, and practically contemptuous about children who are not completely potty-trained by age 3, never taking into account that no matter how hard some parents try, some children just aren't ready yet.  The book includes lists of what a child should be doing and how they should be by certain ages.  My problem with all such lists is that every child is different, and a list like that can be used in a general-age way, but the way they are presented in the book is not flexible.    Finally, what irritates me the most, is that he basically blames the entire "epidemic" on mothers alone.  On page 118, "we can spot a child who has started down the epidemic track merely by hearing the mother's voice......the mother's state is the epidemic, and the child's behavior is merely a symptom".  So according to Dr. Shaw, basically, this whole problem is the fault of mothers.  That very backward attitude right there was enough reason for me to decide not to take this book's childrearing advice too seriously !   Some alternate books I would recommend are The Baby Book by William Sears for general baby care, Good Nights by Jay Gordon for a different perspective on infant sleep, and for discipline, here is list of authors I found to be much more helpful: Becky Bailey, Adele Faber, Elaine Mazlish, Barbara Coloroso, Alfie Kohn, Nancy Samalin, Mary Sheedy Kurcinka. 
 This is an army manual. It is not for entertainment and most of it would be to hard for civilians to understand. If you are in S.F. and you need this book you can find it for free through your command or the local tm/mos library, but if I have to tell you that your probably not really S.F 
 Once more we have a romance writer trying to cross genres and...it doesn't work. While well-written, it wasn't myserious. I figured out early on who the bad guy was - it was too obvious. It started out with an interesting premise and I thought it might be good, until, after having met ONCE the two main characters start tearing one another's clothes off and going at one another on the kitchen floor like crazed weasels! Yuck. I found Dia toooo perfect, therefore unbelievable. I also couldn't believe these people would work together - then be together in all their off-hours. There were a lot of loose ends that were never explained and I thought the ghost thing was an add-on that, didn't work 
 As a Starbucks employee of almost 2 years at my college... I know how to brew espresso and properly make drinks.  My roommates got this for me as a Christmas present at the Field Days Sale so I could make coffee drinks for all of our late night study sessions.  After about 2 months of use... the steamer ceased to function properly and steam came out of the espresso head instead.  I contacted a service advisor at Krups' website and it turns out that I would have to ship the machine to the nearest service center in Illinois on my own dime.  No thank you!  I'll find something better 
 Unfortunatley, Ms. Ornstein's book is not based on actual research, but rather on pre-established suppositions. The gender climate of a school is best evaluated by looking at two factors - student grades and disciplinary actions.  If male students have lower grades than female students, and/or if more male students are disciplined than female students, then it is clear that the school is anti-boy and is simply not trying to teach male students.  Fortunatley, parents are waking up to this fact, and there have been several lawsuits (most notably in Wisconsin) challenging public schools gender bias against male students.  The so called "gender-fair" class menitoned in this book wasn't - since not as many male as female students received "A's".    This book also does not evaluate issues outside of school.  For example, the best measure of the status of a demographic group is to look at mortality rate.  The fact that male students in all demographic groups have a higher mortality rate than female students is not discussed.  This is particularly important since a major contributing factor to this trend is the fact that adolescent males have a higher suicide rate than adolescent females.  Orenstein also does not discuss this gender gap in arrest rate.  Again, the "health" of a demographic group in school is easy to evaluate - simply look at grades and discipline.  
 I have ordered this CD two times from Amazon and both times the CD was defective.  The second disc was completely blank 
 I bought this book last year and read the first few chapters before getting bored. In other words, I had no desire to continue reading it. Much of what he says aren't his ideas, he shamelessly borrows from the great thinkers, so it's probably better just to buy THEIR books instead of one from an author who simply quotes others. He apparently writes book after book regurgitating material he's done before or from others to get rich.   Dyer DEFINITELY has an intention, and it's to get rich by selling his mediocre books. 
 The book contains the really most basic and well known tips - nothing more, you better look in the internet and find far more informative websites. I gave it one star beacuse the amazing photos in the book which made by wonderful photographers. Buy a album insted or Michael Langford's guid if you are a beginner who wants to learn the basics.   
 I would like to warn the reader that the five-stars "spotlight review" above doesn't come from a person, but from a company specialized in this kind of activity and called getAbstract. If you really want to know the opinion of readers, I advise you to read some of the reviews below. There are positive and negative ones, and you will certainly see which are the genuine ones. My opinion of the book may be seen by the rate I gave it.   
 Tastes just like regular skippy i.e. unnatural texture because it contains PALM OIL 
 i tried really hard to like this album.  i can't do it.  every one of the songs is tedious and anti-catchy.  they're like nails on a chalk board.  i saw thursday in concert a couple of months ago and people didn't seem to know what to do during their new songs.  typically a good song will make you want to tap your foot at a minimum.  this album makes you want to set yourself on fire 
 Just received the flex skin and my first thought is that this is way over priced.  This is a $5.00 piece of soft plastic that will do very little to protect the unit.  It will protect against scratching, but only the areas of the unit you're not really concerned about.  The screen is totally exposed, so it can be scratched when in the unit.  I'm sure that's so you can see the screen better, but a clear protective cover (that can open and close) over the screen would have been nice.  Anyway, at $25.00 this is too much to spend.  I'm ordering a leather cover with a kick stand (which by the way you need if you want to stand it up on your desk or on a table) for less than the price of this product.  I feel I just flushed $25.00 bucks down the drain, hopefully you will not.  
 the first few pages of the book is a biographical brief that had been written by a Carmelite nun some time ago. Had this been expanded into a full biography this book would garnish a few more stars. But, instead, the bulk of the book is made up entirely of translations of some of his heaviest epistles steeped in difficult to understand theology.  None of these speaks of where he stood on the issues of his day. The book paints Luciani out to be a man who spent his life on his knees and ignored the issues of his day. Whereas, if one reads Lucien Gregoire's biography of this Pope - Murder in the Vatican - nothing could be further from the truth; as he had spent his life pulling others up off their knees caring for the immense orphan population of his time - monks building and maintaining orphanages and nuns as teachers and as nurses caring for those too ill to come to school. Yet, hats off to the Carmelite nun who thought enough of this great man to have published the first translations of his life into english 
 While well produced, I was disappointed in the album - mostly because the majority of the tracks were re-recordings.  Frankie Laine still sounds great - but it just wasn't the same.  I bought the CD to replace a well worn vinyl album, but on listening to the CD I found the songs to all be slightly (and in a couple of cases very), different in tempo and vocal inflection - it's definitely not the album I've loved for over 30 years!  High Noon in particular is quite different, much slower, with vocal emphasis changed.  I'll probably listen to the CD from time to time, but not with the same relish that I enjoyed my old LP 
 This is an unaltered reprint of a book published in 1912. It's primarily interesting as an example of what amateur scholars (especially in Britain) were putting out in that era.  Cranky and usually hilariously offbase, but often fun to read.  The author's etymological speculations are remarkable: a supposed root AK is the basis of Heracles, zodiac, yak (the animal), akbar ('great' in Arabic): ironically, the correct etymologies of these items were already well-known in 1912, though not, it would seem, to Mr. Bayley. The author's analysis of the Cinderella story will leave your head spinning 
 Positioning makes a few basic points that are helpful for someone who is not familiar with marketing basics.  However, the examples are so outdated that some now disprove the authors' arguments.  The more detailed chapters make less sense in an electronic culture.  This book is really only useful now for those broad, basic ideas in the first chapters 
 If you have the 1976 edition, no need to buy this one.  I thought with a 2005 publication date, it would be an update of the excellent 1976 edition, but no, just a reprint.  Much has progressed in the museum field since the 1976 edition and it would have been nice to see that newer information presented 
 This is a peculiar and troubling book. The author says that secularism is "the rigid control of religious life by the state." That's sure not the way we think of secularism in the US. Furthermore, I can't imagine that many would dismiss the Magna Carta as blithely as the author does on pg. 25 of the hardcover. Bottom line: I found Paul Berman's book Terror and Liberalism far more logical about what's going on in Islam 
 Though this is by no means Argento's worst film (his Phantom of the Opera was pure rubbish), this film is also not among his best, and was a disappointment even to Argento (he considered the production of this film cursed--in a way himself buying into the superstition which was part of the plot of the film).  For the Argento fan this film is quite enjoyable in a piecemeal sort of way, but it simply does not work as a whole.  The plot is fraught with enormous gaps in logic.  The scene when characters in the film rely on the memory of birds to identify the killer among opera audience members is utterly absurd, and the end monologue in which the herione announces that she doesn't need other people and has a lot in common with insects is absolutely random, nonsensical, and has absolutely nothing to do with what preceded it in the film.  Such scenes aside, what hurts this film the most is its absolutely corny heavy metal soundtrack, which has a very negative overall impact on the mood and atmosphere established by the film.  This said, the notorious "peephole scene" is one of Argento's most brilliant and effective sequences in any of his films, and this movie is well worth viewing for this scene alone 
 This is a well written easy to understand book.  But if you're interested in designing loudspeakers, this book is lacking.    This book is clearly and concisely written with good supporting graphics.  Mr. Murphy does a great job of qualitatively explaining speaker design but leaves out two of the most important quantitative design topics:  1.  How to design an enclosure.  2.  How to size inductors and capacitors in cross over networks.  It seams like these topics could have been covered more deeply, and other more advanced topics deferred.  For example, Mr. Murphy commits several pages to warning about summing errors with electronic crossovers (which is a real concern), but there are no pages committed to how to design a Butterworth or Linkwitz-Riley filter he discusses in the book.  I rate this book low because I was expecting more design detail. This book may be of value to you if you're thinking about speaker and just what to know what's involved.  Also, if you're shopping for loudspeakers, this book will certainly make you a savvier consumer. 
 Without going on too much, these stories are fragmented, unclear, poorly written, and the plots are lame and basically make no sense.  I wrote a more in depth reveiw for "Edward's Exploit", which we bought along with this one.  While some other (but most definitely not all) Thomas books revolve around a core group of charaters and seem to teach lessons and have some excitement to them, this book has a new character speaking less and less sense on every page.  My toddler can't get into these.   My two year old will read "Trouble for Thomas", "A Cow on the Line" and "Thomas gets Tricked" over and over and over, but he lost interest in this collection of stories before we had even read it once.  It wouldn't have been too hard for me to have read one story before buying this, but since the other Thomas books we had we such hits I figured I didn't need to . . . BIG mistake!  
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 The author is obviously a highly skilled pilot and has extensive experience. His recounting of the progress in the airline industry is very interesting.  I bought the book expecting to read about progress in dealing with the problems encountered in adapting new technology and adjusting to the obviously over crowded skies. While the author states (over and over) that both are very real problems, he does not offer much in terms of what is being done to address the pilot's ever expanding workload. He seems merely intent on convincing the reader that the industry and the FAA are out to get the pilot. This book is not so much a study of human factors as a pilot's complaints about an industry that probably somehow just became something he no longer cared to be a part of 
 Mr. Lord could have written a good book.  He has the tools and the know-how, and he did his research.  He made one fatal error, however.  Actually he made not one, but two mistakes.  The first mistake is that his starting point is wrong.  As a trained journalist, he does as a journalist does - he keeps trying to find "dirt", or rather manufacture dirt - all in order to give us a "balanced view".  One can't help feeling, as one reads interview after interview, that Mr. Lord has somehow picked only the disgruntled, caustic and jealous remarks to print.  The second mistake was in underestimating "James Herriot"'s fans, and familys goodwill towards him.  He treats his subject manner as just another subject, as routine grist for the gossip mill, but Alf Wight was not that kind of person. He was a person totally out of Mr. Lord's scope and understanding.  He underestimated Mr. Wight's fans and family's tolerance for having his name besmearched, and, indeed, his son wrote another book in response, a beautiful book about his father, and in it he easily refutes all Mr. Lord's accusations - and turns Mr. Lord into a laughingstock.  Because anybody who has read the two books side by side - which I just did - would realize that Mr. Lord has indeed made a laughingstock of himself.  While there are some good parts to the book, they are very much overshadowed by the other parts.  There are two good chapters - in the middle - which were written factually - the chapters dealing with the content of James Herriot's first books, and the publishing history.  There is a good reason why this is so - Mr. Lord was indeed part of the publishing business and would have been privy to that sort of information.    But much of the book is exactly what he accuses James Herriot of writing - pure fiction.  It would take too long to point out every one of Mr. Lord's mistakes, but I would like to simply write just a few of the many mistakes Mr. Lord makes.  The rest, if you still want to read this book, you could find out for yourself.  The first accusation Mr. Lord makes about James Herriot is that Alf Wight did not write a semi-autobiography, but rather pure fiction.  He maintains that even if this were so, it would not matter, because the books are still entertaining.  With that salve to his conscience, he methodically starts to take apart many stories in an effort to prove them fiction.    His first assertion - that it would not matter if it were actually fiction, is simply not true.  It would matter, and matter a lot, to both his fans and friends and family.  His son says as much in his book- that it would matter a lot if his books are fiction.  Fortunately for us, Mr. Lord does not bring a single proof that could stand up to scrutiny.  His method seems to be - I don't think this story is true, so it's probably not.  That's it.  Not one single proof.  For instance, he says that Alf Wight's memoirs of his war years are fiction - because the dates are wrong.  He says that Alf Wight joined the army in March, 1941, and was discharged two years later, and therefore his story that he was called up to the RAF while his wife was expecting their first child is a fictional story.  His son, in his book "The Real James Herriot" explains that he enlisted in the RAF in March, but was NOT CALLED UP until 15 months later, in November 1942, when his wife was indeed, expecting their first child.  Is it possible his son and wife might know when he joined the RAF better than Mr. Lord?  Especially since Mr. Lord actually admits that he is going from hearsay - since the RAF would not give Mr. Lord access to their records, claiming that they were still classified?  This should be enough of a blooper to discredit Mr. Lord; however, there are many, many more - so many that it would be funny if it were not also very, very sad that someone could so easily print a book full of lies and get away with it (by prefacing all his explanations with "perhaps" he covers himself from libel, I suppose).  Another example of Mr. Lord's innuendos -  he quotes from one of Mr. Herriot's books that James Herriot was taken aback by the red (and squished) face of his newborn son, and asked the nurse if there was something wrong with the child.  Mr. Lord asks how can this story be true if he is a vet?  Just so, explains his son, animals are born much more fully formed than humans are.  (A horse is born already able to walk as soon as he is born).  Mr. Lord falls flat in the mud.  Mr. Lord quotes James Herriot as saying that 90% of his stories are based on real life.  Mr. Lord asks how that can  be - when the Herriot books say that he joined Seigfried's practice in 1937, when he actually started working there in 1941?  Mr. Lord, I think we are ready for a lesson in English.  Do you know what the words "based on true life" means?  "Based" means "based", not "actually, exactly, fact".  When he first started writing, he was hoping to remain anonymous, and therefore disguised his stories so that the people he was writing about would not recognize themselves.  He changed the location of his practice to the Dales, he changed the dates, he even changed the characters - some from a man to a woman, for example.  He put two stories into one, etc. etc.  This all falls under the heading of "based on real life".   There are many, many more examples of this in his book - where he "proves" that James Herriot was writing fiction - and he has no proof whatsoever.  Not even one single time.    If there is one person writing fiction, that person is Mr. Lord.  Mr. Lord spends two entire chapters on a conjecture of how Alf's childhood might have been like - all based on the assumption that Alf had grown up in grinding poverty.  These chapters become almost a farce when we read his sons portrayal of his real childhood - although his parents were not rich they were certainly never poor, and Alf had a very happy childhood.  He also explains the economics of why this was so.  Which puts Mr. Lord's two chapters of conjecture on how Alf's unhappy childhood might have been like in the category it deserves - pure fiction.  While the poverty of the under-class in Glasgow in the 1920's is certainly very sad, it definitely does not belong in a biography of Alf Wight.  Another mistake that Mr. Lord makes is that he constantly contradicts himself.  For example, in one chapter he spends many paragraphs conjecturing on why Alf was always poor, when he should have had a thriving practice - and the fanciful castles he builds in the air are very elaborate indeed.  And yet in another chapter he quotes a neighbor as saying - "oh, they claimed they didn't have any money but that wasn't true.  They had money for everthing - a tennis court, ballet lessons for Rosie, etc."  This came across as a vitriolic statement, but of course in contradiction to his earlier assumption that he was poor.  Mr. Lord, you can't really have it both ways, can you?  Another example - he constantly quotes Eddie Steanton throughout the book, with all kinds of outrageous comments, yet he himself quotes one of Eddie's colleagues "oh, Eddie always exaggerates, you can't believe everything he says".  And later in the book it comes out that Eddie had had a falling out with Alf Wight, and I would assume that his "memories" might be somewhat tainted by those sentiments.  And yet Mr. Lord accepts Mr. Streaton as a fully credible source.  As matters stand now, this book is laughable and barely deserving of a review - except for one thing:  if Mr. Wight's son would not have written his own biography, Mr. Lord's fictious book would have remained as the factual biography of  Alf Wight.  He would have succeeded in besmirching Alf Wight's name with his book full of lies (oh, excuse me, fiction).  The fact that his son wrote his own biography, and a beautiful and moving one at that, has turned Mr. Lord's book into a joke, a book that his fans would not touch with a ten-foot pole, but Mr. Lord did not know that in advance.  He tried to change James Herriot's fans opinion of their idol, by trying to find "dirt" on him, and that was a very low thing.  The fact is that he fortunately did not succeed, but that does not take away from what Mr. Lord tried to do.  Mr. Lord, shame on you 
 Because there were so many great reviews for this movie, I decided to go out and rent this film and watch it.  I was bored to death watching this film, and whats with the words "what's wrong" kept being said over and over again every time someone opened the medicine cabinet in a computer generated voice?  Those words and that voice really annoyed me!  Why does this place have not one person with hair?  Now, I'm not trying to be raciest here, but what's with a black girl and guy dancing totally nude on t.v., well  I can only say that the girl was totally nude since they only showed the guys chest and up.  What's with that guy who kept stalking one guy by saying that he wanted to be his new roomate?  Was he supposed to be gay?  I guess this film is way to so called "artsy" for me.  What I know is that this film is boring, and when it comes to ending, you don't know what happends to the guy at the end.  The film just kind of fades out after he stands on top of that cone stairway.  This film makes the movie The Village exciting to watch.  I wish that I could give my money back 
 The Church of Scientology teaches that millions of years ago and evil alien leader came to earth with a fleet of "space planes" and killed huge amounts of aliens whos souls haunt us to this day. That was the stupidest thing I've ever heard until I read Mrs. Browne's book 
 In a land where the cops have to run away from gun toting street gangs because the so-called law won't let them do anything about the problem, how can you consider the government anything but extraordinarily liberal (read socialist)?   If our nation's government today, or in the 1980s, had any hint of fascism in it, why does it, and why did it, encourage immigration from third world nations en masse?   And, of course, one must wonder how a nation whose foreign policy is so often determined...err...influenced by the State of Israel can be anything like a fascist dictatorship. Surely AIPAC, not to mention the SPLC/ADL/ACLU, haven't allowed us to stray from their chosen (socialist) path? 
 Read the first few chapters and the last few pages.  As usual, the remaining 300 pages were just repetition.  Danielle Steele should come up with a new "formula" (as mentioned in previous reviews) or tuck her pen away once and for all. 
 This book is an extremely wordy book and I did not get a clear direction for a practical training program, unlike Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot, which I would highly recommend 
 This is a good book, but most are under the impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the book.  Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.  For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.  Einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the world of physics.  Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book 
 I recently moved back to Chicago and needed a map as a refresher.  I was very disappointed when I received this map.  It's great and handy, unfortunately it didn't cover the city.  The map didn't show Bucktown or anything West but included all of the Southside.  I was looking at moving into an area that I didn't have a map of!!! If you want to see any of Bucktown, Wickerpark or Logan Square do not buy this map 
 If I was asked to give you a plot synopsis of this gorgeous film I would be hard pressed to say that OSCAR AND LUCINDA is about  anything for sure.This is positively the singlemost butchered screenplay I have ever sat through.Laura Jones has adapted Peter Carey's novel and Gillian Armstrong has turned out "something" that is so chopped up and nonsensical that, apart from from the very quick shots of New South Wales and a magnificent soundtrack by Thomas Newman,  I had to keep pausing the film to say,"WHAT???!!!" This film is about everything and it is about nothing;it is about obsession and compulsion;it is about different religions;it is about chance and faith;it is about a father and son;it is about how a grandson came to be.........but it certainly IS NOT about two connected characters named Oscar and Lucinda.Each scene of this film is SO short and abrupt that the viewer never has any time to identify/sympathize/empathize with ANY of these extremely disconnected people and events.There are SO many plots and subplots and themes and subthemes and non essential material and characters that it is positively laughable and annoying to see such squander of good source material in the wrong ,uncapable and un-understanding hands.It seems that trying to tell any of the heart and soul that is revealed in Peter Carey's novel in slightly more than two hours proved to be too much for those involved in this endeavour.What a shock to see the immense talents of A -list actors such as Ralph Fiennes,Cate Blanchett,Ciaran Hinds and Tom Wilkinson literally wasted in 20 second scenes!Even the breathtaking land of the Australian outback is shown for five seconds at the most.AND THE ENDING!!!!!.....what in Heaven's name was that???Either most of this film is still on the cutting room floor( edited by the noferious Nicholas Beauman of LITTLE WOMEN,COUNTRY LIFE,COSI) or Laura Jones and Gillian Armstrong just simply could not find any center and focus for this beautifully filmed "butchered" mess of a movie.2*'s because the Thomas Newman soundtrack is so lovely,but nay a farthing more!! 
 I found the book heavy-going. Points are hammered home and I could not help wishing the book were much shorter. I do not think I as a reader would have lost much if there had been less detail. 
 Although easy to load a smart card, this viewer was disappointing in quality.  My pictures look fine on my computer, but the pictures were dark and there was no instruction on how to change the contrast etc. (although I found that it the picture could be adjusted, it was never mentioned in the manual).  The manual is, because of the comment above, disgustingly incomplete. If not going through the bother of returning it through Amazon because I purchased it on line, I would not have kept it.  I actually bought another digital frame that was smaller and cheaper and it was worse, otherwise I would have given it only one star.  I could have purchased a unit a Circuit City or BestBuy and been better off 
 I have to admit, I had to give up on this book by chapter 2, there were so many misspellings and factual errors: "Floradora" girls, Evelyn "Nesbitt," "gangster" Diamond Jim Brady, "P.T. Barnum's star Anna Held."   I really blame the publisher more than the author. Does no one send these books through fact-checking or to an editor anymore, or are they just churned through Spell Check 
 So there I was......browsing through Amazon.com and on "the page I made" up pops, guess what? Triumph of the Nerds on DVD. Seeing this, I was just reaching for my credit card to snap up a copy of it when BAM! I read one of the reviews......   Still a great show, but the Ambrose edition is not complete!, October 28, 2004   Reviewer:    Sean Breazeal (Mt. Pleasant, UT USA)  I immediately checked with Bob, and Yes, sure enough, several minutes had been cut from the original US release for "space" requirements. In his defense, Bob had no input on this. Were it me? I'd be hopping mad.  Instead of the publisher, Ambrose, using this opportunity to create a new and valuable product by adding deleted scenes, extended version, and extras, they chose to go on the cheap and cut to fit rather than make a product worth purchasing.  Bob Cringely is a genius and is thorough in all he does. Had they used this chance to extend what was probably the best compilation of the modern 'net age and add what I'm sure was hours of extra content Bob had to cut, I'd have been the first guy willing to pay retail to buy it. Having purchased 3 copies of the boxed video set (1 lost to a fire, 1 lost to a non-returning friend) there would have been NO hesitation to this. In fact, I'd have watched it straight through on receipt.  What a HORRIBLE, horrible mistake Ambrose has made. FIX IT!!!!  Don't walk, RUN from this edition. I know it's Old school, but do yourself a favor and buy the video tape version. You'll thank me later 
 The author clearly knows their topic. It is a pity they are unable to develop a clear and compelling narrative to the life of Henry II.  Details, then details within details, thicken this soupy "read" until all sense of pleasure and color in reading about the life of Henry II evaporate. This is not a book for the general reader, even one with much background in the Middle Ages.  Instead, "Henry II" is for scholars in search of finely woven exposition about the history of Henry II who do not require a flowing, interesting narrative 
 I saw this movie before I realized it was a remake. Yet, I still found the ending predictable. This is largely because (as I have now seen the previous version) the islanders are turned into a bunch of vicious maneating feminazis. The second mistake was the switch in setting from Britain to the U.S. You can't turn Pagans into Puritans. Yes, they made reference to Celtic ancestors, but they seemed much more as if they were from Salem. It is as if the original has been sanitized of its nudity and religion, and made into an empty shell of a movie 
 After about 4 months of using these cables they are starting to flake out.  My screen will start flashing and one of the colors will go completely out.  Have tried hooking it up to different inputs on T.V. and used different sources with same symptoms.  If you dont mind jiggling the cable every other day then these may be for you 
 Love the movie, but the quality of the DVD put out by Alpha Video was so bad it was very difficult to watch. The sound was scratchy and muffled and the picture looked as if the brightness was turned all the way up. If you don't want to be disappointed and feel like you've been ripped off, wait for the remastered cut before you buy this one 
 How Cherry Red allow such releases to be part of their roster (albeit under the Lemon subsidiary) is beyond me. I've heard several Lemon CDs now, and they've all clearly betrayed their vinyl origins with audible surface noise. In one case they've even ripped it from a scratched LP  This time around they've done a better job, but check out the fade from track 4. It's all gone quiet, then suddenly the needle jumps and you get the last few seconds of music all over again  Far from being furtive about this, they routinely trumpet their releases as "remasters", and have made several false and misleading claims about albums being available on CD for the first time  I don't know if Amazon will accept this review, but hope for the sake of honesty and fairness they will. Emails to Lemon about the poor quality of their CDs get no response. With so many reissue labels out there doing a fine job, this company should be ashamed of themselve 
 Holbeins illustrations are brilliant and fascinating.  This book is very inexpensive.  These two factors should make it a great addition to any library.  But the images are something like 2 inches square.  You can't see any detail really.  I was disappointed and I guess I'll have to find another book as I would like to enjoy this macabre and fascinating series 
 I just heard this album the other day... it had been a while since I laughed so hard.  This is the most absurdly pretentious attempt at opera rock since King Diamond.  It's more ridiculous than Meat Loaf, except Meat Loaf doesn't take himself so seriously.  For a second it sounded like they were trying to harden their sound, which is about as out-of-place as David Spade trying to butch up his image by wearing football armor.  Then I noticed that they had changed labels to Roadrunner, a label notorious for trying to make every band sound the same; so apparently Roadrunner is trying to make them sound like metal.  The slight changes in their sound have nothing to do with growth or maturity, they just got a new producer.  This album is basically just the MTV / short attention span version of their previous albums, it's the exact same stuff but cut up and rearranged into smaller sections (don't worry, those gassy ten-minute songs are still there, they just get diced up a little like someone's channel-surfing)  I guess I should give them a little bit of credit for not trying so hard this time to conceal the fact that about 85% of the album is filler material, but I think their goal was commercial accessability.  Just more smoke and mirrors to try to make a comic book look like an art gallery.  I'd say that if you're into Opeth you would like this album, but actually there's a good chance that you won't, because it appears this is an effort to sell out. 
 From the back cover:  Miracles do happen!  Award-winning actress Mary Steenburgen (TV's JOAN OF ARCADIA, HOPE SPRINGS) gives a solid performance as Ginny Grainger, a young mother who rediscovers the joy and beauty of Christmas, thanks to the unshakeable faith of her six-year-old daughter Abbie (Elisabeth Harnois) and Gideon (Harry Dean Stanton), Ginny's very own guardian angel. Ginny's wonderous experience will touch your heart and warm your soul in the timeless tradition of past Disney favorites. ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS fulfills all your most treasured Christmas fantasies. Share it with those you love.  And my review:  I'm such a sucker for Christmas stuff. I probably own more Christmas books and movies than regular ones. So this review is not from a "Bah Humbug!" Scrooge. And I don't expect all of my Christmas films to be "happy happy joy joy" all of the time. My absolute favorite of all time is IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, which can be very dark in places.  First off, I don't think that the acting was bad in this movie. And the cinematography was pretty good as well. I made my judgment based on the content and the storyline, which, in my opinion, flopped.  What I really found annoying was the way Ginny, the heroine, was constantly being villified. For example, let me paint you a picture of her life: her husband was laid off and hasn't worked in six months. They have two young children. She's making minimum wage, and they're barely scraping by. They've also been evicted from their home (since it's owned by her husband's previous employer) and are forced to move in with her father-in-law. They have very little saved in the bank, and yet her husband wants to take out $500 to buy Christmas presents for the kids. She understandably balks at the idea. First of all $500 is way too much to spend on presents for just two kids, even if you're rich. Unless you want your kids to become spoiled! (Remember, this movie was originally made in 1985, so that number is even more outrageous. Plus, they have only one meager paycheck to live on and no house of their own. I think that she's being reasonable. But she's painted as the bad guy for not blowing a bunch of their savings on toys.  Then her husband wants to sink what little money they have into his own bike shop, and possibly go into debt to own his own business. Again, she's villified for being the only responsible one, and telling her husband that he needs to get a steady job with a steady paycheck. After all, they may need their savings to survive. This is not the time to be blowing it on dreams that may never pan out (and usually don't, since most small businesses fail in the first year). But no, she's shown to be a mean, cold-hearted witch for saying this. Grr. It was just so irritating. Yes, you want to give your kids a magical Christmas, yes, the husband has always dreamed of owning his own shop, but you have to be responsible, especially when you have children to feed the clothe. I don't think she was being a Scrooge for wanting to be a responsible adult (she did buy her kids resonably priced gifts, after all), but the film painted her as such.  And this film was so depressing. It felt like the world was constantly kicking this family while it was down. The happy ending was a long time in coming.  Also, I'd be very hesitant to show this movie to impressionable young children. I certainly wouldn't want one of my children to think that they can constantly disobey me, run away from home in the middle of the night, or talk to creepy-looking strangers in trench coats. That's how kids end up abducted or killed! Not really realistic.  I really expected better from Disney, especially when I really loved one of their other Christmas movies, THE SANTA CLAUSE. There are way better Christmas movies out there. See my list "Christmas movies that I watch every year" for movies that are worth your time and money. I don't recommend ONE MAGIC CHRISTMAS. If you're still determined to watch it, try to rent it first, or you might find yourself upset that you wasted your money, like I was. 
  This is humor? When does the humor begin? Is it close to the end cause I reckon that this ain't funny. Maybe the fans of this guy can go home and beat there spouses with banjos and leave the rest of us alone, I reckin 
 Not very good selections from the series I watched as a kid. Thr students in my class got bored of them after a few minutes 
 Okay, you may like it if you're a brainless 10-years-old white caucasian upperclassman. Otherwise no. All BSC books are dull but this one is the dullest. Like parents were going to give their kids to a bunch of  13-years-old. And the throwing up scene in the carousel. How thrillin 
 This is my second book by Moore that I've read.  I have found him to be an alternative thinker.  He writes some great things criticizing the course of modern society however some of his positions on morals are just unthinkable for a former monk.  I agree with the reviewer who questions Moore's advice to the women whose husband was cheating on her.  I've found some good insights while digging through this earthy volume.    
 rec'd this pitchback and assembled, the cords that hold net to frame disintegrated and broke free after a short period of time. park sun was unwilling to replace or address faults.  very disappointed.  
 I've had an old coffee maker for a long time that makes good coffee but I thought I was ready for something even better.  I am disappointed with this one.  I thought I couldn't go wrong with a KitchenAid product, but sure enough, I did.  The design is attractive and I like that you don't have to purchase paper filters.  However, I have two problems with it: 1) The coffee isn't hot enough. I like a very hot cup of coffee because I put milk in it which cools it down a little.  My old coffee maker made very hot coffee so it didn't matter how much milk I put in, it was still hot.  Not so with this one.  The coffee was luke warm after I put my usual amount of milk in.  This is my main complaint and I'll probably have to return it for this reason.  2) Next problem is that I set the automatic timer so I could wake up to a fresh brewed cup of coffee.  I set it according to the manual instructions and I think I did it correctly.  When I woke up this morning, no coffee!!  What a disappointment.  I think I'll go back to using my free coffee maker from Gevalia that has reliably made good coffee for me for the past three years! 
 Received Garmin Navigator Package card product without card in clear blister package. Package opened and data card removed. Amazon immediately issued credit to account  when empty package was returned and issued a coupon for my inconvenience 
 Though the description of this product says it's filled with natural buckwheat hulls and rice, mine had a strong smelling deodorant coming from the removable bags you heat. I used them once and then packed them away because I do not like the odor. I wish the mitts had been unscented. Perhaps over time, or by next winter, the odor will be gone and I'll get some use out of them 
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 I think potentially the only part of this cover that is not horribly photoshop'd is the dude's face.  I like the real bear smoking the cartoon cigar tho, that was a nice touch. 
 The book was a copy of the textbook. The print quality is so bad it looks like the words are disappearing in front of your eyes. 
 "The Lady with the Torch" is the new recording from Patti LuPone and it does a nice job of parading out every maddening vocal mannerism Ms. LuPone has polished over the years (inexplicably to the delight of many of her fans).  Her notorious mush-mouthed diction is particualrly noticeable on this recording.  The first line of "Early Autumn" is virtually indecipherable and the problem persists throughout the rest of the track.  Time and again, consonents are glided over as if they're in the way of the song as Ms. LuPone continues in her career-long quest to completely do away with consonents from her repetoire.  Then there are the vowel sounds, and I believe she covers every possible (and many impossible) vowel sounds currently existing in the universe.  A's sound like E's, O's sound like U's -- this CD should be retitled "What Did She Just Say?"  You don't need a lyric sheet for this recording; you need an interpreter.  "My Buddy" comes out "My Body" and "Body and Soul" comes out "Buddy and Soul."  Maybe she's hidden some sort of sudoku game in the recording so listeners can have a little fun.  For much of the CD, LuPone sounds like she's holding her nose.  Add that to the other two problems identified in this review, and interpretive style simply "fies ou the winno."  I'm sorry, that's "flies out the window."  "I'm Through with Love" is another example of mush-mouthed delivery wrecking a song, but special mention must be made of "Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry."  Her phrasing here is not only odd, it's unprofessional.  Taking a breath after the word "guess" is singing lessons 101 - you don't break up a phrase with your breaths.  And she does it three times!  As Patti says in the liner note, "oy vey!"  The sad thing is, Ms. LuPone possesses one of the greatest vocal instruments on Broadway in the last 30 years.  Just listen to the recent cast recording of "Sweeney Todd."  Her mannerisms are kept to a bare minimum (no doubt with help from skillful director John Doyle) and her voice soars and entices in ways many singers will never be able to approach (her losing the Tony was a sin).  So what gives here?  She sounds more tired than on the "Sweeney..." recording, so maybe it was a case of overwork.  Overwork or not, this recording does not present the lady at her best.  Paging Bernadette Peters 
 First, let me say I wanted to love this book. The first O'brien book I read was The Things They Carried, a masterpeice. I suggest to all who were turned off by July July to please read this before writing him off. He has enormous talent, but this book didn't show any of it. The characters are barely credible. The setting of the reunion seems as if the characters dropped into a twilight zone scenario: they can and do haunt the Darton Hall campus in the wee hours, no buildings are locked, no security guards are ushering them out of the door, as if the campus is a ghost town, a mere prop waitng empty for thirty years instead of a real place with a whole new set of students. The dialogue of most characters not only sounds the same, but has the same style in that many scenes end with a character emitting what is meant to be a clever quip. On a more positive note, the sub-tales are mostly quite good, such as David Todd's tale in 'nam (I loved Johnny Ever, the most interesting character in the book), the tale of the lover who drowns (reminded me of a story by Richard Ford), and most of all Marv's tale. Tim, if you are reading this don't be discouraged. I know you have some better stuff in you. Maybe you got a little lazy or contrived on this one. Best of luck on your next effort 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 Perhaps it is because the show is UK based but I was taken aback by some of the after pictures.  Alot of dresses over pants and very outlandish hats are shown as do's.  Some of the befores don't look too bad other than the dated 80's look which I think we all know not to wear.  I would have preferred more tips on handling body types rather than the obvious no's.  They put in some really sloppy don'ts which aren't much help unless people in London are really walking around like that. We need more realistic don'ts as opposed to the obvious 
 Image is good but microphone has a jackhammer noise, rendering it useless. I only installed it after a few months after purchase or else would have returned it immediately 
 In desperate need of a light read and curious about the multi-author approach used with this novel, I dove into "Naked Came The Manatee" with anticipation of the fun and excitement typical of Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen writing.  The story unravels the mystery behind two heads, both with a great similarity to Fidel Castro that are lost in transport from Florida to Cuba.  Each of the thirteen authors writes a chapter of the novel, with Hiassen and Leonard attempting to pull the story together in the final chapters.  The characters are odd and criminally inept as most characters in Hiassen's and Leonard's writing but the story is underdeveloped and lacks the immediacy of a great crime mystery.  If you have nothing else to read and this book happens to be within reach give it a try. Don't expect much and you won't be disappointed 
 the authors  argument move away vague, impressionistic and general arguments about the supposed powerless state which globalization is meant to have induced. However,  the concept of state capacity in his book is so vague that will weaken his argument. On the other hand, the states that the author select to support his conclusion cannot represent all the states in world. With the development of globalization, the capacity of multinational corporations is obviously more and more stronger than small states in the world. In Asian financial crisis, some individuals can destroy a nations economy and make is backward about 20 years. From this point, the state become more and more powerless instead of what Weiss think in this book 
 I give this version 2 stars, 1 for Natalie Wood, who is superb, and 1 for the story itself. Rosiland Russell who was a great actress,(Auntie Mame, The Women), but definately not a singer, is miscast big time!! If they had done the right thing and cast Ethel Merman, the combination of Merman and Natalie Wood would make this a classic today, which it definately is not. The Bette Midler version is far superior 
 Before I begin, I'd just like to clarify something. I'm not sure which page this review will end up on - the page for the first edition, or the second. It belongs on the page for the second.  The first edition is the one with a plain yellow cover and a small picture of a typewriter in the center. It's the plainer of the two. The second edition is the one with the glossier cover, and a co-author as well as Robert J. Ray.  That being cleared up, I'll begin.  I've owned the first edition of this book for several years now. I've worn it to shreds - it helped me write my first novel, dig me out of writer's block, and give me the drive to search for a career in writing. The margins of the pages are all filled with penciled-in notes, and I know almost all of the exercises by heart.  So when I saw that a new, expanded edition had come out, I was estatic.   It was only after I bought it and sat down to read it that I remembered the true, if slightly cliched, saying: "if it's not broken, don't try to fix it."  The new edition of The Weekend Novelist has tried to become too many things. The first edition does what it says it will, and it does it with a quiet grace. This book is full of large, black letters, and assurances that writing will the most difficult thing you've ever done, that it almost certainly can't be done, and that it shouldn't be attempted.   In an attempt to cover more types of novels, the new edition has introduced two new forms of plotting your novel. In addition to the old, linear Aristotle's Incline, there are two new forms: the circular Hero's Journey and Mythical Journey. This would work well, but the references to different points in them are vague, it's difficult to tell when you should use the Journey plots, and the information isn't very coherent. The first edition used one book (The Accedental Tourist) as an example, and it worked wondefully. The new edition uses dozens of books as examples, the result being a large, difficult-to-wade-through mess. I was constantly forgetting which book was which, and having to flip back to find out.   Robert J. Ray's first edition was beautifully written. It praised the act of writing through writing, and it quietly stole your respect. This new edition, like I said before, seems jaded. It makes every part of writing sound like a difficult chore. Instead of inspiring me to write, it made me frightened of my own notebook.  Perhaps the thing that I was most dissapointed in was the book's lack of structure. The first edition weaves all the exercises together seamlessly. This one is confusing - the pieces don't fit together. You'll be left with a series of exercises that aren't coherent, wondering how on earth to connect them all.   And it doesn't even get you to the end of your novel! The front cover guarantees you a completed novel within a year, but this new edition completely demolishes the chapters about the second and third drafts. It makes vague references to them - but then, after you've finished the first draft, it gives two small, frustrating chapters about memoirs and screenwriting - not about novels at all!  This second edition has definitely changed for the worst. The exercises are still good, but they lack something to pull them all together. There are lots of conflicting examples, and the whole tone of the book is depressing. Buy this book, but buy the first edition. It's the real masterpiece 
 Found recipes dated, layout makes it difficult to use and although some of the how-to is useful, its generally from another era. Bought Gourmet cook book instead 
 I was listening to water boil this morning. I preferred it to this album 
 Kevin Trudeau has an understandable vendetta against the government, big drug companies  and modern medicine at large but he goes on about things that I already knew.  Then, wanting his magic answers to the natural cures, he refers readers to his website where he asks a monthly membership fee.  In the end, you come away devoid of any alternative health solutions, unless you want to spring for his fee to access the website.  I call that a bunch of hype and empty promises.  How do I know whether or not his website is any more informative than his tease of a book? 
 I guess I am the minority with my review.  I thought this book was a yawn.  Shock value aside (incest and rape, along with a shocking surprise at the end), it read like a high-schooler's angsty prose.  I found myself skipping through much of the overly-descriptive thought, just to get to the point.  I rolled my eyes several times through plot twists as they were just plain absurd.    The book is a quick read (I finished it in about an hour).  I wish I had just taken it out at the library instead of spending $10 on something I can read in one sitting.  All in all, the material is meant for 'mature' readers, but the style is clearly not.  A lot of reviewers say that the 'love' between the main character and her brother is just 'beautiful', but I failed to see the beauty in animalistic um.... stuff between siblings.  In my opinion, this book is purely shock value with no substance, so if that is your thing, then go for it 
 Many people in the reviews have pointed out how many exercises are too advanced but lack to point out many are also too simplistic. My problems with the book is it seems to be lacking and could have included more exercises. Also theres only one intensity for most of the exercises, after you master the "harder" ones it doesnt get any harder. I find it hard to believe that  someone like Jay Cutler could use this book and not lose mass to his abs 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 I know that this product works for some, but for me it did not. That is why I decided to return it. Wahl makes great products, but this product was not for me. My skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it. 
 I too was required to read this book in the 6th grade.  I couldn't understand how this book could be an award then or now.  I'm a huge Eckert fan, but this story just doesn't cut the mustard.  For a better Eckert book, check out Johnny Logan 
 	This is a horrible, stunningly horrible, book. It has, sadly, persuaded me  	that I cannot simply trust the O'Reilly brand as signifying, if not the  	best book in a particular area, at least a worthwhile book. 	The central problem is that this book has no idea what it wants to be. 	It tries to be a tutorial, a cookbook and a reference, all intermingled.  	One paragraph it's trying to talk to newbies, the next it assumes you are  	a long time Apache veteran.  	One role, however, that it seems to have no interest in playing is that  	of giving the big picture, of describing exactly what Apache can (and  	can't) do in a given area, and why you might care, before getting into various nitty gritty. 	I'm afraid I can't recommend a good book on Apache to buy; I would  	however urge you to stay away from this one. The worst shovelware out,  	Sams Teach yourself Apache in 24hrs or Apache for Dummies, cannot be  	worse than this sad failure. 	(This reviews version 3 of the book. I have no idea if versions 1 and 2  	were less dreadful. 
 I too was annoyed to find that the first 2/3 of this book rehashed the Virtual Doonesbury and Planet Doonesbury books I already owned. Even more irked to find the CD doesn't support Mac users!  It's still Doonesbury  and these are great strips but I wish Trudeau would think of his FANS when  putting these books together. I feel betrayed 
 As a cat lover, I've enjoyed the Cat Who... books immensely.  However, this book left me with a lot of questions, and there were several items mentioned that were never resolved.  Homer Tibbet had been a prominent character in many of that series of books, he dies, and that's the last mention of him.  Surely, James MacIntosh Qwilleran would have attended his funeral!  Same thing for Liz Hart.  She's killed in a car accident, and that's the last we hear of her.  What about the impact of her death on Derek Cuttlebrink,another prominent character in this series?  We've read all these books, these characters have become important to us, and suddenly we're left hanging in these relationships.  I'll continue to read the new books, but they're clearly not what they were even 3 or 4 years ago 
 this reduced and illustrated book leaves you very unsatisfied, please buy the  unillustrated version and laugh for hours on end. 
 Hate buying a product that advertises as Director's Cut ...so as to expect more ...only to see less on it than what was broadcast on cable tv (that I can still remember having seen probably at least 10 years earlier during, if not shortly after, my college days). I believe the DVD box or advertised trailers for the movie even shows some of the original broadcast footage that was not in this DVD. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect to see "Shakesperean" quality acting/dialog in this. I was expecting your basic campy cheesy somewhat mindless B-movie with let's say some "eye candy" ...so as to get away from your everyday real-world concerns. But worse, the actual cutting of the scenes was SO BADLY edited that you think the Director had just barely graduated from some overseas mail-order/night course film school. Finally its just sad that they couldn't even give us the broadcast version of the movie and have labeled it as the Directors Cut ...it should be labeled CENSORS CUT 
 What a disjointed mess, talk about cashing in on fame.  All he did here was take a bunch of columns he wrote in the paper and called it a book.   I could have done better with the letter to the editor section of the paper.  I was not that enamored with Liar's Poker and this book has done it for me with this author.   It was just that the articles were not that relevant any more and his writing is not that good 
 I was very disappointed at the quality of the recipes in this book. One recipe actually used boullion cubes for the stock!! From the tilte of the book I would think that each of these soups would be a "labor of love". None are very inspiring. I will probably never open this book again. I suggest the Willams Sonoma "Soup" highly over this 
 I first heard traffic in 72 with low spark thhis is the follow up record it is a lackluster album.try the new winwood cd.mik 
 if the cd is defective why amazon dont stop releasing this dvd and release A GOOD ONE WITHOUT THE DEFECTIVE CD and save customers EFFORTS TO GET THE GOOD ONE FROM WB???? i think its amazon RESPONSIBILITY to sell GOOD PRODUCT 
 From a lifelong lover of L&H films, zero stars, unless negative numbers are an option. These films are lousy through and through, and no degree of print quality or extras or low price or anything else could make me want them. They are painful to watch and about as humorous as Henry Daniell playing Doctor Moriarty. In deference to the two funniest men who ever lived, these atrocities should be burned along with the rest of the 1940s garbage forced upon Stan and Ollie after Roach sold their contracts.  If you really like Laurel and Hardy, do yourself a favor and get the 21-disc L&H set from Amazon.uk. It contains all their shorts (sound and silent) and some of the early movies. It also contains  the foreign language versions, in which L&H and most of the other actors actually speak their lines in Spanish, French, etc. Further, it includes different versions of certain titles.  For "Bonnie Scotland" and "Fra Diavolo," get the separate 2-disc set in NTSC. You'll have to purchase a region-free, PAL converting DVD player, but they are widely available in the United States and will play anything. (Don't buy a cheap one--the good ones are hardly expensive. 
 I guess it has simple language that a new reader could read.  But I bought this book to read to my daughter to help with our upcoming move.  I'm glad I read it myself before reading it to her.  It does NOT teach a child how to make friends. First, he goes around town asking 'Who will be my friend?' and only adults respond to him. They agree to be his friend, but none of them has time to play right now. Then, this poor kid goes to the park, asks to play, is rejected, then starts playing by himself.  It is only after the other boys see that he is good at throwing and catching the ball that they allow him to join them.  That is not very instructive.    
 This book belongs in the genre of what I call Grouch Books: extensive  laments about costs and consequences of technology, but with no attempts at  syntheses or solutions. At every turn, the author paints a "no  exit" vision of the internet: if it's freewheeling and unregulated,  it's "chaotic" and "disorganized"; where it's  centralized, it is overbearing and freedom-robbing.   The author makes it  seem as though the people concerned with hardware and software development  are thoughtless, greedy, naive, or some combination. Any hint of  libertarian ideals in the shakers and movers of digital culture is  dismissed by Rochlin as naive and illusory, and every tendency of this  culture is, in his vision, toward loss of humanity and the replacement of  art with artifice.   This book is single-track thinking at its worst. And  to anyone who has experienced the benefits of digital culture and design,  the complaining tone grows tiresome and monotonous.  On those very rare  occasions when he begrudges some possible benefits of the internet,  Rochelin immediately qualifies them out of existence. The increased  information made available by the internet, for example, is seen as all  right for those who use it for "social development," but not for  "conversation and entertainment" -- as if mere conversation had  nothing to do with social development.   If readers want to read about the  costs and consequences of technology, they would be far better advised to  go through a book such as Neil Postman's *Technopoly.* While just as grim  in his assessment of the current state of affairs, Postman has a much  greater range, and at least has the intellectual stamina to propose a  solution 
 What a shame this DVD transfer is so aweful, because the movie is great. I have seen this movie before on SBS TV (Australia) and have been wanting a copy since. But this DVD looks like a transfer from an already poor quality VHS copy. Very disappointed 
 Half of my pictures are out of focus making it useless.  Should have sent it back 
 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt

 This book is perpetuating false facts about Reiki and its history. Hayashi did not charge $10,000 for master level training as this book claims. And certainly Usui did not charge anywhere near $10,000 as the book is  suggesting. This book also states that Usui was a Christian monk, when in  fact he was Buddhist. Another false fact presented in this book is that  Hayashi was Usui's successor, when we know through research it was Ushida.  The society that Usui founded in 1922 still exists today in Japan and is  called Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho. Ushida was the second president of this  organization after Usui made his transition. I recommend the book Reiki  Fire for those interested in the true and verifiable history of Reiki or  contact the Usui Shiki Reiki Ryoho society in Japan. These are only a FEW  examples of the incorrect information this book is presenting about Reiki  and its history 
 out of date with the latest versions of Adobe Premiere ver. 5.1 and subsequent versions.  Wait until the book is updated 
 I hope you are luckier than me in receiving a Criterion DVD that doesn't stall and skip like the one Amazon sold me. The price is pretty high to get a shabby DVD. The movie, of course, is terrific: well written, funny, compelling. Too bad after Chapter 13 ("Xmas Eve Day") the DVD itself falls apart. 
 Wow, what a bummer. I was really looking forward to this book. I enjoy science-cyberpunk-fiction-y type books with female protagonists, but this was sad, sad, sad.  First, the idea. The idea just isn't good enough, or at least, the solution to the plot isn't good enough. Gibson clearly loves suspense, so he writes as though really exciting things are happening, even when NOTHING IS HAPPENING AT ALL, and the hero mainly feels nervous. It makes for tough reading. The characters that you are expecting to hook up never do. There's a weird side story thrown in that has NOTHING to do with the main story.  The main character is supposedly good at figuring out what "works" in advertising, yet is allergic to certain brands, will barf at the sight of a Tommy Hilfiger logo, and has a pathological fear of the Michelin Man. Not only would someone like this not be able to work in advertising (even on a consultant basis), but the fact the Gibson is unable or unwilling to explore this idea branding and logo identity beyond something that the protagonist simply "gets" is really annoying.  Save your time and money. Not that a used version of this book is expensive or anything.  I've read Sweet Valley High books (not recently, of course) with more interesting plot lines and narratives 
 Borrow the book from the library.  Wasting your money on fables is not wise (unless you like wasting money).  While entertaining, this is not worthy of a library collection item 
 A previous reviewer noted there was "nothing on it that could receive air play" and I am basically in agreement -- with an exception.  When I went off to college (Ann Arbor) in 1968, the DJ on the local FM radio station started his shift at noon, and always began by playing a minute-long catchy little song, after which he would announce his arrival by saying "High noon, hi friends."  I liked the short little song, but had no idea of the title (there were no lyrics) or artist, so I wrote to him and asked.  The answer was "Phase 2: The Beat Goes On" by Vanilla Fudge.  It's entry number 7 on the track list above, and I believe the first song on the second side of the album I bought.  I've always liked it, but was never sufficiently stoned to appreciate anything else on the album. 
 I carry my organizer with me. I purchased this in spite of its larger size because overall I liked the format and because of the menu, grocery, and to do lists.  As far as functionality goes, it would be nice to have some tabs (monthly or by section). Also, I agree with many other reviews on the 18-month format. Why print calendars that overlap year after year? I'm carrying around 6 months that I will have to replace and will throw away. It seems a gimick to add an extra 6 months that, IF you continue on with this calendar, you must purchase again (unless you choose to go without a planner for 6 months every other year!)  Also, I wonder why they couldn't bother to put an attractive cover on the thing. If I carry this with me I'll be looking at these peole I don't know (and carrying around a big ad) for 18 months! Maybe a tear-off with Amy's picture if they must and then the permanent cover below; something more subtle, like most other famiy calendars. I liked how the familytime.mine has a variety of covers to choose from and am considering replacing this one with it 
 This book is a great stepping stone for understanding.  But considering the Occam's Razor Theory; "the simplest explanation is the best"  I feel simply that understanding Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs is a better source to understanding your childrens needs, or anyones for that matter.  Being that our primary purpose in life is to be successful leaders of service to others.  By clearly understanding the role we are in, knowing what actions to be successful to DO, and implementing a system in the home to cover all 4 primary needs of our children, then we will automatically cover any areas of possible "temperement hinderings" in others.  To achieve the above, I reccommend the Bible.  The book by Hal Urban, available here at Amazon.com titled Lifes greatest lessons.  20 Things That Matter (to know the 8 things that sucessful people do).  And refining revising and rennovating our habits to revolutionize the impact we have on society through this lost art called "A Family". Confucius stated; "The strength of a nation derives from the integrity of the home"  I say...Duh!! 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 Published in the November 2006 issue of the UK journal Literary Review:  Ilan Pappe is an Israeli academic who has made his name by hating Israel and everything it stands for. In his view, expressed with obsession and a degree of paranoia, Jewish nationalism, that is to say Zionism, has been from its outset a deliberate tool for dispossessing the Palestinians; and therefore it is to be condemned root and branch. He reserves the Palestinian term of Nakba, meaning catastrophe, for describing what to Israelis is their war of independence of 1948. To him, Israeli politicians and soldiers, one and all, are so many murderers. Forests have been planted only to cover up the past. Houses are `monstrous villas and palaces for rich American Jews'. Everything Israeli is ugly, everything Palestinian is beautiful. One day, he supposes, the Israelis may well consummate their original crime with something even worse. The only possible alternative lies in the immediate return of every Palestinian to his original home, and that will mean the end of the state whose existence so offends Pappe. This, of course, is exactly the inflexible position taken by Hamas and the PLO.  The reader's initial reaction must be one of pity. Poor man! What a strain it must be to belong to a nation whose members are so overwhelmingly unbearable that he longs for them to be overpowered by others. Yet there is more to it than that. Sad and creepy though it is, Pappe's anger is open to rational analysis.  The doctrinal element pushing Pappe into anti-Zionism is his prominent involvement in the Israeli Communist Party, known as Hadash. An outcrop of pure Stalinism and always a marginal movement, Communism in Israel rejected Zionism in favour of internationalism, according to which Jews and Arabs were to form a state together. Events, indeed the whole thrust of history, have proven this to be a complete illusion, but Pappe remains one of a minute handful still in its grip.  The further emotional element pushing Pappe towards his hatred of Zionism is best elucidated by J L Talmon in his profound book, The Myth of the Nation and the Vision of Revolution. Among the `horribly charged and tormenting questions' Talmon asks is why so many Jews have adopted identities that seemingly allow them to deny their Jewishness. Uncountable numbers of Jews have followed the example of the Karl Marxes, Trotskys and Rosa Luxemburgs who sought identities as Communists and revolutionaries in the hope that this would allow them to merge with those who otherwise would be their persecutors. Some Communists - like Lazar Kaganovich, and many in the KGB as well as leaders in the Soviet satellites - set about the deliberate destruction of the Jewish religion and culture. Talmon speaks openly of the neurosis and `morbid masochism' motivating such unhappy people.  In Nazi Germany a few Jews tried to camouflage themselves in a similar manner. Felix Jacoby opened his Kiel University lectures in 1933 by comparing Hitler to the Emperor Augustus. Dr Hans-Joachim Schoeps and Max Naumann even formed a movement of Jews for Hitler. With gallows humour, other Jews replied that this movement's slogan was Raus mit Uns, or Out with Us. In Israel today, Neturei Karta, a sect of ultra-Orthodox Jews, believes that the Messiah alone should bring about a Jewish state, and that Israel is therefore an impiety fit for destruction. In New York they have a branch called Jews Against Zionism, and recently they welcomed President Ahmedinejad in person there, supporting his call for genocide in Israel. Pappe is the secular and political version of these sectarians. As often happens, extremists have come from opposing poles only to reach the same conclusion.  Zionism, in Pappe's conventional Marxist view, had nothing to do with the need for Jews to survive persecution by Europeans or Arabs, but was only a settler and colonialist movement cynically directed by British imperialists and their greedy Jewish collaborators. He characterises David Ben-Gurion, the driving personality in the latter stages of the foundation of the state of Israel, as someone who always intended to expel Palestinians from the land. To bring this about, he assembled a body which Pappe refers to as the Consultancy, but the details of who these people were, and what they really did, he fails to give us, instead preferring to conjure an aura of sinister conspiracy. The Israelis were always the stronger party and knew that they would win out at the end of the British Mandate in 1948, Pappe says. In contrast, the Palestinians were defenceless and hardly violent at all, designated victims whose villages were mercilessly overrun and many of the inhabitants butchered.  A huge literature exists in British, Arab and Israeli archives to reveal the multiple reasons for the flight of the Palestinians at the time, ranging from a belief that invading Arab armies were about to rescue them, and they should move out of harm's way, to a cultural reflex that they could not accept Jews in positions of authority, an escapism on the part of some leaders and delusions of power on the part of others, and of course fear. Savage things were certainly perpetrated by both sides - ï¿½ la guerre comme ï¿½ la guerre - but Pappe will have none of that, completely ignoring the context in all its complexity and local variation. His technique is to list towns and villages as though their capture involved always and only simple brutality and expulsion. No mention of the Jewish need to survive in an existential struggle in the aftermath of the Holocaust; no mention of the 6,000 Jews killed, which was 1 per cent of the population; no mention of Azzam Pasha of the Arab League promising a massacre of Jews on the scale of the Mongols; no mention of Arab radio propaganda and disinformation; no proper account of Arab military successes, brushing over Arab atrocities and the destruction of Jewish settlements; no mention of the countervailing expulsion and expropriation of a million Jews in Arab countries.  As history, the book is worthless. In interviews Pappe regularly explains: `We do [historiography] because of ideological reasons, not because we are truth seekers.' For him, as a Marxist and anti-nationalist, `there is no such thing as truth, only a collection of narratives'. To substantiate his particular ideological narrative, Pappe puts the worst possible interpretation on any Jewish deed or word, while validating anything said or done by Palestinians. For evidence of Israeli monstrosity, he relies on quotations from his own previous works or from Palestinian polemicists, and above all on the oral testimonies of Palestinian refugees. Over half a century of military and ideological conflict has passed since their exodus, but Pappe declares his faith that whatever they now say is true. This might all seem too pathological to matter much, but Arab and Muslim extremists are making huge efforts to contest the legitimacy of Israel, and many of their allies on the international Left will lean on Pappe for purposes of `pilgering' and `fisking'.  The final element contributing to Pappe's mindset lies in the sphere of psychology and fashion. Contemporary intellectuals have long been accustomed to glorying in an adversarial stance towards their own society, preening themselves as men of nobler spirits than the dull indifferent masses around them, and isolated not because they are foolish but because they are brave. It is a form of snobbery - moral snobbery - which is why intellectuals of this kind are so widely resented.  There is a fatal contradiction at the heart of Pappe's advocacy of the immediate return of all Palestinian refugees as the necessary condition of peace. If Israelis are really as vicious as Pappe presents them, then Palestinians could not possibly want to live among them. Are Palestinians to return only to wipe out Israelis or to be wiped out themselves? Poor Palestinians, poor Israelis, to be mobilised for such fates. And should Hamas, the PLO or President Ahmadinejad make good on threats to eliminate Israel, there will not be time to rescue Pappe from the consequences of his moral snobbery and his Marxism, or to discover whether he really applauds his own Raus mit Uns demise. 
 I am 15 years old and was required to read this book as summer reading for my school. Let me just say that this is the most punishingly boring book I have ever opened. I say opened because I just could not finish it. I was doing fine until I reached his section about the future of computers. I had to skip the entire section...about 50 pages or so. It, along with almost every other section of the book is impossible to understand, at least for a 15 year old. After that, the book just kept going downhill, and I gave up. This book is not interesting in the least. Avoid at all costs 
 I saw this ad on TV today and about to purchased from here at Amazon instead of zone pilates' web site. I kept reading reviews and one reviewer (Evelyn from FL) mentined that the ring would not stay on the body. Actually, I was thinking the same. I was about to purchase and saw s/h fees (about $15). Also her "Keep on looking" and I did. I found out "Everlast for Her Pilates Fitness Ring with DVD" here at amazon for only $14.99 (ASIN: B00091RYZY ) and "Bally Fitness Ring for Pilates with DVD" $17.99 (ASIN: B000H3YNR6 ). Both are very identical to this zone pilates and eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping on orders over $25. Sorry, my review will not be helpful for the seller of this zone pilates but maybe for actual customers, like me.  PS. I have similar pilates rubber resistant ring and it doesn't stay put on the body, especially near the hip. It is good for toning my legs though. I really want the butts from the models of Zone's commercial. Maybe I can try with Everlast ring with half price.  Update 1/11/07: I received my Everlast ring yesterday. The physical ring is very identical to this Zone ring but actual workouts are quite different. I really like Zone's workouts from commercial (you can also watch again from their website), especially for buns & thights. I wish I can purchase just DVD from Zone with low s/h :)  Update 1/16/07: I'd also purchased this Zone Pilates from Walmart (~$25+7 s/h) and received it yesterday. It was a huge mistake! The ring is very identical to Everlast, not any better (rather slightly heavier). The accompanied DVD has only 2 workouts and they last only about 10 min. and the second workout is slightly modified from the first one. They were not as effective as Everlast's workout DVD, which is more precise and has better menu. The instructor from this Zone Pilates, Kim Stoneman, has flabby belly and sloping buttocks! It seems like she is not using her own ring unless it's not effective as advertised and she proved that! Very un-motivating for me! She stands in front of a still camera so we cannot see particular movements from different angle (unlike Everlast, you can see those). Zone Pilates advertised with a different model with pretty body but you cannot see her in the workout DVD. Don't waste your money to belive the commercial and purchase this Zone. I'll return mine to Walmart ASAP 
 I was very excited to try out this tent at the beach.  We got it set up and my 4 month old was taking a nap in it out of the sun.  Everything was great until the cabana suddenly collapsed on him.  One of the supports had broken.  It was the first time I'd used it.  I was very disappointed 
 A comedy featuring four sexy stars as representatives of Heaven (Fanny Ardant, Victoria Abril) and Hell (Gael Garcia Bernal, Penelope Cruz) battling over the soul of a Mexican boxer is promising, but this attempt at satire, full of symbolism (Hell is represented by English-speaking executives, for example), is clumsily executed, only rarely amusing, and the superb Fanny Ardant is not given anything to do.  What a waste! You'll be better off watching any of the other movies each of these stars has done for more talented directors. 
 This book lacked a lot of focus in what it wanted to accomplish.  Was it trying to give tips on how to win at Monopoly or trying to show how the game teaches lessons to be applied to real life?  In both cases, it came up lacking.  The tips it gave were rather common-sensical, the stories it shared didn't really give any insight into how the game applies to business, and to top it off, it didn't not give accurate rules to the game.  For example, the book said that you couldn't collect rent while in jail, so you should always try to stay out of jail and in the game, just like in life.  That's a nice maxim to live by, but you CAN collect rent while in jail and every good business person knows that there are times to be aggressive and times to be conservative.  Overall, the book was very disappointing and I hope only to spare others from making the same mistake of wasting time reading it 
 Word had filtered down to me from my many literary sources that Joy Williams' novel, The Quick and The Dead was akin to many of David Lynch's enigmatic and enticing films. Being a huge Lynch fan, I decided to check out her book. Sadly to say, this book was no where near the type of scope that Mr. Lynch works with. I've been reading voraciously for about 35 years and my literary tastes cover a wide spectrum of styles and approaches.  Rarely have I ever had to wade through a book as if it were linguistic molasses. But the Quick and the Dead fits this bill. While some of Ms. Williams' writing styles is quite good, the novel as a whole is a mess. Obnoxious characters that fail to even give the reader a hint of caring about, plots that seem to go nowhere and scenes that are just plain absurd. Most books take me about two days to read at the most. I finally got around to finishing this one about two months after I started it. Only picked it up when I had nothing better to do. Take my advice. If you want to spend money on paper, save it for a few rolls of toilet paper. You'll be more satisfied 
 This is a 12-page promotional piece for Kouzes' and Posner's books and Leadership Practices Inventory, a 30-item questionnaire about leadership, written in the breathy style of business-school literature.  A true non-value.  If you are interested in their work, buy The leadership Challenge (Jossey-Bass, 1997), which has the same editorial tone but at least says something 
 This "novel" would be better suited for the stage.  It reads like a play, often.  It's not realistic as the author goes overboard in depicting "high drama" within a family.  They suffer a tragedy that would certainly affect a family but to the extent the author has them changing is not realistic at all.  There are far too many scenes of shouting, histrionics.  The father goes from being Ward Cleaver to a verbally abusive monster.  If I had to see the mother one more time with her calling "Robin!" I was going to scream.  The author needs to understand that high drama and a climax will be inferred by the reader after seeing the conflict.  This author forces the climax onto us in every scene.  He's desperate for this end result of angst, high drama and shock.  It's overkill.  I don't believe that a 14 year old would become this promiscuous.  Sure it happens but this was the Leave it to Beaver family at first.  It just doesn't make sense that because of ONE incident, all members of the family devolve into sordid disasters.  In short, the author needs to be focused more on telling a story, allowing the reader to infer.  Instead, he thrusts high drama and climax onto us at every turn.  It's ironic, actually, as he's trying to make us feel drama but he did it so much that I just felt tedium.  Very, very contrived and forced novel.  Not believable.  I do not recommend 
 This is by far the worst action/adventure book I have ever read.  I'm surprised that aliens didn't show up at the end to fight against everybody else...  How this book ever got a top review is beyond me.  Please do not waist your tim 
 This movie is not a war movie. It is not remotely related to history either. Guadalcanal was not like this as anyone who knows the people who fought there and the history. Since when did American troops in WW II carry pliers around to extract gold teeth from dying enemy soldiers? This depiction is just simple minded and pure excrement. Enemy soldiers all hugging around and teary eyed over war is hell? Can we spell Bushido? Mallick can't.   Now, if you like touchy, feely, not the real world aesthetique, have at it. The scenery and photography is quite good.  
 If you know anything about Army aviation or Apaches, Fire Birds will either tick you off, or make you laugh till you puke. This was supposed to be the Army's Top Gun? So sad. It's so unrealistic, I wish the Army had had veto power on this one before it was released. 
 This book is yet another in a series of young idealistic teacher reaches out to kids successfully works. Don't get me wrong, I think the author does an admirable job of trying to find a curriculum that works for her students. The problem lies in the fact that none of her ideas are all that innovative or compelling. It's standard practice to attempt to teach children writing through assignments that let them write about themselves.   Furthermore, this book is peppered with the old cliche "all the veteran teachers were resentful and jealous of me but we all know that it's because I'm better." Give it a rest. Teaching is NOT a calling. None of us pulled a sword from a stone or took a vow of chastity. Teaching is a profession -- a difficult, ever-changing, skilled profession which requires specific training and a lot of hard work. Simple as that. When the author gets all philosophical and refers to her "need" to teach and her inability to do anything else, she gives reason for others to think that teachers should remain underpaid, overworked, and burdened with many responsibilities they never signed on for. Prevailing thought is that teachers are "called" to their profession so they will do it no matter how little you reward them. This book reinforces that intolerable cliche. Teachers will never be treated as the competent, skilled professionals they are until they dump this garbage and demand to be counted as such.  Also, I'm not demeaning teachers who try to shake things up in their first few years. I'll concede that some of the most innovative and exciting movements in education come from those who are viewing the profession with new eyes and lots of energy. But remember for every plan as the one described in this book, which was quite successful, there are far more new teachers who dismiss pedagogy at the expense of their students' education. There are reasons behind the traditional methods of teaching.   The follow-up to this book is entitled "Teach from the Heart." That scares me. Don't teach from a place of emotion. Teach with compassion in your heart, but teach from your skills. Teach from your learned opinions -- those you got in college and those you got in your constant re-certification training (not required in every profession, but required for teachers).  All in all, this book is OK. It's uplifting when you wade through the pity party the author has about how unfairly she feels she was treated. Listen to the stories of the children involved for a very eye-opening look at what young people in our society face. But let THEM be the authors of what you read. The author's "notes" are more of the same and can be found in any "new teacher takes on the system" drivel 
 This video was a huge disappointment.  Bought if for my small kids, and it failed to keep their interest.  Not only was it slow, but the acting was poor.  Rascal the racoon gets little screen time for a movie in which he is the title character.  If you're looking for a good animal movie, Charlie the Cougar is a huge hit with my kids, and their friends. It's classic 1970's Sunday night Disney - a treat for parents as well 
 Martha Grimes has had a good thing going with the Richard Jury series, until now.  Bizarre is too interesting a word to use for this book.  More like muddled, drawn out, and difficult.  The story within a story is an intriguing idea, but it went nowhere.  The plot is weak, the characters' actions unbelievable, and the ending disappointing.  I have enjoyed reading this series, but to be honest, this book was a waste of time.  I think it's time for Jury, Plant, and pals to be put to rest.   
 This is another in a long history of books written by blind men describing the elephant's trunk. Other great books and essays in this tradition include "Free to Choose" by Milton and Rose Friedman, "The Law" by Frederick Bastiat, and "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt. All these books are quite good at describing the trunk (or a tree), but miss the elephant (or the woods) in the process.  For what it covers, it is a fine book.  However, Sowell forgets to apply all of his principles to the most influential business organization in the market, the corporation. The corporation has the perpetual life, limited liability and personhood. The qualities of limited liability and personhood could not be reproduced without government intervention in the market. Yet, limited liability and personhood are ignored so that he can focus on rent control or price controls. Are rent controls really more important to the economy than a corporation?  Before the libertarians and conservatives that are reading this get their [...] bunched over a corporation being able to be created without government intervention, think about a third party being hurt by a corporate action. If a corporation mistakenly dumps toxic waste on land that you own then goes out of business, who is responsible? Answer: No one. You made no contract with the offending corporation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. You are left paying for the mistake that others made because the government granted limited liability (or limited irresponsibility) to corporate investors.  Is limited liability so trivial that it can be ignored? If yes, then let's get rid if it. No more limited liability. If no, why doesn't Sowell explore the unintended consequences of this government intervention?  I suggest you take Sowell's advice and think about the secondary and tertiary consequences of corporate limited liability and personhood. Now that could make a good book. Does limited liability change incentives? Does the gathering of capital through limited liability have an impact on political campaigns and lobbying (and through lobbying, changes in the law)?  This book is just more stuff, on a pile of stuff that was better written 
  Why do publicists lie so much? A 'love affair'? This shows how unreliable the comments on the flaps and covers of books may be.    Her correspondence with Mr. Doe is scarce for a span of +20 years. And how on earth did she manage to keep the letters she sent to Marks&Co? Maybe she wrote them on carbon paper and kept the copies for +20 years? She retrieved them from the addressees after +20 years?   Leaving aside the veracity of those letters, Helene Hanff's relationship with Frank Doel is that of a customer and a seller; nothing more, nothing less. Their letters educate us about some literature and about the availability and good/bad conditions of the books in Marks&Co, in a post-war background. Not very enticing.  If we bear in mind that this is a 'diary' kind of book, it is essential that we get on with the author. But I find her writing style irritating: she often behaves like a hysterical insisting person; she over-uses words written in capital letters and exclamation marks; and always tries to be witty and funny. No wonder the attitude of londoners was often restrained and odd while she was in London.  I'm glad Miss Hanff got her letters published at last, but in my opinion this is an overrated booky.  
 I wholeheartedly agree with some of the previous critiques of this book.   Islamic cultures are extremely barbaric when it comes to adults and their consenting relationships. Indeed, while it's insanely difficult to imagine that any reasonable person would EVEN care about who another person finds attractive IN RELATION TO that person's own sexual anatomy, the fact remains that most Middle Eastern, Islamic theocracies care A LOT (to an excessive and embarrassing extent) about this sort of thing.  While most developed, contemporary countries are finally beginning to treat adults like adults, Allah-fearing countries are just now putting on their Shiite kid-gloves, and pulling down your pants faster than you can scream "ALLAH!" To suggest otherwise is fallacious and absurd.   This idealistic pipedream belongs in the same mythological trash-pile as the good old Qurrrrr'an.   ETA: By the way, if you're going to go out of your way to click 'no' in response to whether this review is helpful or not, at least take the time to leave a comment explaining WHY it's not helpful. To be sure, I don't see how what I'm saying here about most Islamic theocracies isn't true. (They KILL people for doing ANYTHING sexual with others of their same sex. That's not exactly debatable. 
 I'm a psychiatric nurse. Peter Breggin is well known in the field of psychiatric medicine as being anti-all drugs.  Has prozac been overprescribed or mis-prescribed? sure. but this drug and the class it belongs to have helped WAY more people than they hurt. penicillin and other antibiotics can kill you too if you're allergic and don't know it. and antibiotics are WAY over prescribed if you ask me and other professionals. i've worked in state psychiatric hospitals and i've seen a LOT of people who only got out and back to the world because of medication.  i would hate to think that a book like this would turn back the clock to the old days when there was no medication and people wasted their whole lives in the hospital. GET A GRIP: ANYthing you put in your body has side effects and you can die from taking too much Tylenol, too. picking on this drug is a cheap tric 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 OH PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THESE BOY BANDS. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BOYBANDS OUT NOW. AND WHO IS THE WORLD IS C-NOTE. THEY ARENT EVEN FAMOUS AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. N-E-WAYS THEY DONT SOUND GOOD AT ALL AND IM GLAD I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY BY BUYING THIS CD. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO A BOY BAND GO AND LISTEN TO NSYNC, BACKSTREET BOYS, OR 98 DEGREES CAUSE AT LEAST THEY KNOW HOW TO SING 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 As a molecular and cellular biology major, I've taken my fair share of biology courses and know a good deal about the workings of the body and its cells/organs. The ways in which mitosis, nerves, etc. are described in this book are decent, but there's no argument as to HOW or WHY any superior force possibly would have created such a body. The author plays the chicken-and-egg game with too many topics and ultimately lumps himself with the Intelligent Design crowd. This book may serve as a biology primer for some, but there's no proof and very little discussion on God. Considering that the title and his previous books' titles mention God, why would this book have almost no discussion on God? The layout of the chapters is as follows: 20 pages of biological explanation, followed by a few paragraphs that ask questions about God or origins or something similar - but the questions make little sense and go unanswered. I went into this book with an open mind and was floored by his superficiality. Save your money and time 
 Before I start, let me nail my colours to the mast: I'm pro-science, I'm pro-evolution, I really like the idea of rational enquiry and I'm a sceptic bordering on the cynical. I'm *not* some lentil-munching, kaftan-wearing, feng-shui-hugging hippie with airbrushed unicorns and a yin-yang sign on the side of my Kombi. Honestly.  Now we've got that cleared up, let me say it straight: This book takes on some big arguments, but, other than humorously swatting some flies, loses hands down. All it succeeds in doing is illustrating that there are fakers, losers, charlatans and wankers to be found in the Social Sciences departments of any given University. Anyone who's been to university and didn't know that deserves a clip around the ear and to be sent to the back of the class. Now either Sokal didn't know that ( - ~clip~ -), or he's spent half his book shooting fish in a barrel. That might seem like good sport, but before long it becomes obvious it's a cheap thrill.  Having said that, I sincerely doubt that the titillation of seeing dumb French Feminists taken apart is what made this book such a splash: I think it's because of Sokal's purported intent: to undermine the notion of cognitive relativism, especially as it associated with modern philosophy of science, in particular the work of Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend. This is the battle: Sokal aligns with those who say scientists are the exclusive purveyors of a shining light called truth; the Barbarians at the gate are these simpering postmodernists who want to tear the temple down.  While the poseurs cited in this book are certainly (for the most part) phoneys or idiots, I think Thomas Kuhn was neither, and while Paul Feyerabend overplayed the court jester hand, he had some important things to say too.  So, to the first point: Proving that one writer (or a hundred, or a thousand) who purports to adhere to relativism is a charlatan doesn't establish anything about *the idea* of relativism. All you have established is that you have a found yourself a charlatan. Give yourself a star.   But while you're pinning it on, remember that postmodernists do not have a monopoly on illogical, bamboozling, balderdash:  Example: Sir Roger Penrose (Emeritus Rouse Ball professor of mathematics at Oxford University, no less) and his dreadful, lumpen-headed, and deliberately bamboozling anti-AI tract "The Emperor's New Mind". The very point of the (no doubt correct but nonetheless entirely irrelevant) science deluged on the reader in that book is to obscure the fact that the real emperor was Roger Penrose and his arguments on AI really blow the kumara.   Example: Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker's Linguistic Nativism, which has held sway for a good thirty years in many linguistics departments, and is anything but post-modern: nativism holds that humans have an innate understanding of grammar hard wired into their biology. From my paltry readings in linguistics and the philosophy of language, my impression is that Pinker's and Chomsky's arguments are seriously flawed. (See: Sampson: "The Language Instinct Debate" for a thorough linguistic critique of nativism; see Rorty: "Contingency Irony, and Solidarity" for a philosophical perspective on the contingency of language). Make note of this example, as it becomes relevant later on.  Secondly, Sokal and Bricmont (quite deliberately) refuse to engage on certain topics, in particular on cultural or aesthetic relativism, which they say (without providing a reason) "raise very different issues". Take that star away, for this statement betrays a fundamental misunderstanding about relativism. Actually, ethical, aesthetic and cognitive relativisms raise different manifestations of *exactly* the same issue: Cognitive relativism, in that it relates to "epistemic" truth (as opposed to "moral" truth or "aesthetic" truth - both of which seem intuitively more questionable ideas) is simply a cut closer to the quick: indeed, the aesthetic and moral brands of relativism rely for their plausibility on cognitive relativism anyway (i.e. if the truths we understand about the physical universe are contingent on our language, then it follows that ideals of right and wrong and beauty must be similarly contingent on our language).  Thirdly, Sokal provides the following account of cognitive relativism:   "While scientists ... try to obtain an objective view ... of the world, relativist thinkers tell them that they are wasting their time and that such an enterprise is, in principle, an illusion"  Now that, to put it mildly, is a *very* punchy version of relativism, and not one that any credible relativist philosopher I know of (and certainly not Thomas Kuhn, who spent a whole book explaining how and why the process scientific discovery works) subscribes to.  That is, in the trade, known as a straw-man argument: You set it up to knock it over. Here goes:   P1: Relativists say science is a waste of time P2: Science helps us reliably predict and react coherently to phenomena occurring in the world  P3: Things which help to predict and react to such phenomena have genuine utility  C1: Therefore, science has genuine utility C2: Ergo, science is not a waste of time  Case closed. Is relativism dead? No: the problem is, most relativists I know would completely agree with all of the above argument except for premise 1. The cat is most definitely still out of the bag. (In a nutshell, all reasonably stated relativism says is that you can't know that your theory actually maps onto the actual configuration of the outside world; it may, it may not: logically there will always be some other possible explanation for the same set of data, however implausible or difficult to imagine, and in part that difficulty in imagination may be a function of the historical contingency of our belief in, and description of the world in terms of, the current "paradigm". Relativism simply says the best you can do is to know that, for now, your theory works, not that it is *true*. Though Sokal and Bricmont may disagree, I don't think this is controversial amongst philosophers nor, really, scientists.)  Lastly, in criticising an admittedly utterly ludicrous passage bestowed on the world by that splendidly silly feminist philosopher Sylvia Kristeva, Sokal makes the following footnote:  "...Kristeva seems to be appealing ... to the 'Sapir-Whorf thesis' in linguistics that is ...that our language radically conditions our view of the world. This thesis nowadays is sharply criticised by some linguists: see, for example Pinker ..."  Hold the phone. The implication is that the Sapir-Whorf thesis (as to the contingency of language) has been discredited, but by none other than Steven Pinker in his "The Language Instinct" which, as per the above, is at the very least a controversial piece of writing. This is an extremely important point, since it's utterly central to the credibility of the anti-relativist cause, and if one takes Geoffrey Sampson's book (cited above) at face value the nativist claims themselves are built on very suspect reasoning and scientific research. It seems to me (and to writers like Richard Rorty) that language must radically condition our view of the world, because that's the only basis on which we can even describe it.  At the end of the day, properly stated cognitive relativism is no a threat to modern scientific discourse, except that it relegates the scientist from "truth knower" or "person through whom you may have exclusive access to the truth" (sounds a bit like a grand high pooh-bah or - dare I say it - high priest, doesn't it?) to "person whose theory works the best for now" and who may be in competition for that status with other people in the community whether or not they're scientists.   If science *does* work better than feng shui or healing crystals (and I, for one, think it does) then this shouldn't be a particularly troubling way of looking at the world for a scientist who is at ease with his views and his value to the community. So it makes the knee-jerk reactions against relativism, from the likes of Sokal and elsewhere Richard Dawkins, all the more mystifying.  Olly Buxton 
 Although the arrival/condition of the book was perfect, the content was very limited.  I learned nothing new and feel I wasted my money.  My parrot is still obnoxious.  I had so hoped I would learn techniques to change his behavior 
 The objects and images in Mutter Museum are obviously fascinating and I can see that even though most of the photographs of them in this book are truly tiresome.   To quote another review I read on the book "the archival photos from ...the Mutter's storage rooms that are the real treasures here.... In spite of their generally more clinical nature, these photographs of patients and odd medical conditions often achieve a level of artistry equal to the efforts of the featured contemporary photographers. "   I disagree. The old clinical photographs are far more interesting than the " featured contemporary photographers" Why? Because the ' featured contemporary photographers' just tried to hard to be interesting. They didn't let that objects etc speak for themselves. I don't need to see the photographers pet dog posed with the human foot in a jar. I don't want to look at the 'infant skeleton with club feet' with its feet artfully cut out of the frame. I want to look at a photograph of something as interesting a preserved head in focus...not shot in a meaningful out of focus way 
 I have been a devoted Hiaasen fan from the beginning and awaited all his novels which are few and far between with much excited anticipation.  Although his writing remains flawless and some of his lines are hysterical, the story is just so silly I found it hard to keep my attention focused.  I compare reading this book with watching a sponge bob cartoon which I do with my children on occasion.  Sorry, I just couldn't finish it 
 If you're made to buy this book you have every right to hate the professor that makes you do so. This book is a punishment! Not only is it very expensive, but it also offers information that it is not relevant to the real world at all.  There are some positive sides in this book after all. There are quick references on almost every page to make it easier to follow the chapter; there are good graphs the explanations to the graphs as well as the general argument do fit (more or less). There are also case studies, a fairly solid web page, and self-assessment questions that are helpful to get through with this material.  However, the style is unnecessarily pompous, filled with theories that make no or only very little sense; the information presented is way to shallow to really understand what the authors are getting at, yet miraculously they manage to fill the book with more than 500 pages with endless waffle. In some places, the author's even contradict themselves, which is the most impressive thing about this book.  Generally only two stars are awarded for this book, as it really is a waste of money and time, however if you have to read this insult for any intellectual mind, you will find some help to make nonsense into a science. Good luck to you! 
 Simply stated,if you want a politically correct magazine that panders to the socialistic academic minority, buy the mag. I'll pass and go online to the authors ignored and enjoy reading about the real new horizons 
 I purchased this little sweeper to sweep up bird seed and crumbs on the floor from the kids.  For the bird seed it's ok as long as you make a couple passes.  For food and feathers it seems to pick up about half.  Also, I've only had this sweeper 6 months and the battery slowly died and I always fully discharged and then charged the battery. I would suggest getting anopther sweeper that has suction and not just a revolving brush 
 I bought this item for my son and the Love and Licks Jack Russell for a Christmas party gift.  The "bark" sounds more like a whine and I have yet to get either of the dogs to wag their tail or kick their leg like the box says.  Followed instructions to the letter and neither of them licks.  Sounded like a great gift.     Update, I contacted the manufacturer and was told by the customer service rep. that she too had trouble getting it to work.  Suggested that I try rubbing "extremely" hard under the collar on the neck.  This did work and after getting the dog started it is pretty cute.  No where in the directions does it tell you about rubbing under the neck.  If buying this for a smaller child, be warned it will definitely take and older person to get the dog barking, wagging and licking 
 Sir Cyril Burt achieved unparalleled results in researching the effects of environment and heredity on identical twins.  Only after his death did it become clear that the alleged research had never happened, that Burt lied to further what he perceived to be a greater truth. Sadly, the possibility must be considered that Milton Erickson did likewise.  Not only do the results he claimed to have achieved involve impossible to believe coincidences and phenomena far beyond anything ever achieved by anyone else.  They also include results that even unshakable believers in hypnotism's real existence concede are unreplicable and should be impossible.  If Erickson really accomplished what he claimed in various medical journals, then he was a miracleworker beyond compare.  Somehow I doubt that. 
 Inaccurate.  The same issues that plague cheaper scales.  I might accept this if it was a $20 scale, but it isn't.  A scale this price should at least be able to produce accurate weight readings.  Do not buy if you can find something comparable with good accuracy 
 Quite possibly one of the most poorly-thought out rants I've read yet on the whole "entertainment is destroying America" controversy.  All arguments he presents are simply straw men that he's created to bolster his point.  None of the serious criticisms that have been laid against him and his work have been seriously addressed.  Don't waste your time with this drivel.  One star 
 While I much rather prefer to read about the U.S. Civil War and The Second World War, it seems that I have read this book in bits and pieces elsewhere. None of the information presented by Mr. Fromkin came through as especially enlightening to me and the majority of his main thesis - A localized dispute between the Hapsburg Empire with Serbia being used as a pretext for the German Military to incite a continent wide war - was not all that shocking. That coupled with the redundancy with which the author presented his argument would have me advise you to check elsewhere for another book on this topic 
 I should have listened to my first instinct not to get this book when I noted a Harvard child psychiatrist wrote it.  But when you're a fan you suspend disbelief in order to hear what other "average Americans" have to say about Springsteen's work.  I agree with one reviewer, Coles book sounds like Cole writing what he thinks common folk think about Springsteen's songs.  Either that or he has worked with the people featured in the book so much, they have taken on his voice.  I finished the book not out of fascination for what the people said (some of their insights and observations had me wondering if they really listened to the music or perhaps took some bad college literature classes), but out of what seemed strange similarities between the interviewees.  They are purportedly from different walks of life and parts of the country, and yet, if you read through, you will find they have similar ways of phrasing ideas, ways of speaking they hold in common (that are not in keeping with how most people speak), and similar rhythms to their speech.  It had the feel of coming from the same Harvard educated author and not interviews of different "common folk".  I'm not going to accuse Coles of fabrication, rather of embellishing the stories (heavily) with his voice and his ideas.  Beyond the question of authenticity, the interpretations and visions of Springsteen's songs in this book are soulless in my opinion.  They do a poor job of exploring the teenage angst of his earlier work, the worker/adulthood angst in later work, and the angst of his favorite topic - societal misfits and deviant's.  When one of the interviewees in the book states that the songs Nebraska and Johnny 99 are trying to get you to feel sorry for the main characters - it goes to show how far off the mark the interviewee and Coles are 
 I agree with the reviewer who called it a "bogus treatise." I read this book after personally witnessing a remote viewing experiment (documented on my website). I did not read the whole book, only chapters 1-7 and 16 (I wasn't interested in debunking Uri Geller). Chapter 3 begins with a Robert Browning quote "...you'll find what you desire", I assume targeted at "believers" in the paranormal. But it equally applies to the authors. In their "replication" of Targ's remote viewing experiments the authors selected as the viewers a few students and a housewife who "believed themselves to be psychic to some degree." Of course, they did not believe in the existence of the phenomena they were testing -- otherwise they might have allowed themselves to make the assumption that it might require someone who practices. If you were testing "exceptional athletic abilities" would you select a subject who played softball once a year and "believed he was athletic to some degree" or would you select a professional athlete?  For remote viewing, you could select members of the Hawaii Remote Viewers' Guild, for example.  Their intent was not to study the phenomena using an open-minded scientific approach, but to "debunk" it - in the typical sarcastic style 
 I was an art history student when I took a class in 18th century art. This text is unfortunately the only survey of Rococo and French academy art from the era, so there are very few alternatives than just the Rococo chapter in a general survey book like Janson's History of Art. The material is organized thematically, not chronologically, which could be engaging if the text was not so confusing or superficial. Most of the book focuses on the art of the 17th century, and absolutely nothing after 1760. The section on Rococo interiors is fairly comprehensive, however, and to his credit, Minor does include writings from Winkelmann and Diderot, grave omissions from previous survey texts 
 I have not finished this book yet but so far I think this woman is a nut. Referring to grocery store shelves as morgues for "dead" food. That's just stupid and weird. No cooked food? None? Forget it, lady. She has some good ideas but they are taken to the extreme 
 I never received this item therefore I cannot submit a review 
 This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who.  Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work.  This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition.  The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen.. 
 More ignorant ramblings from someone who hasn't done any research, which is typical of the rabid Christian 
 The trade paper back was excellent what Marvel did here was take all of the character development, internal struggles, and just about all the debth to the story and threw it out the window and taked on an alien conspiracy to make more action (because pretty explosions is the only thing we need to make a good movie right?). Buy the book, movies like this is what makes comics still look bad. worst adaptation of the year. Quality control people 
 ... Tyrese Gibson, for WORST ACTOR EVER.  Up to this point, I've been a huge Paul Walker fan for his comedically bad acting.  He's made a career of it.  In this one, his impressive acting techniques involve the use of the word "bro" at least 75 times (to give his character street cred), and thoughtfully rubbing his chin during meetings with the other cops - it's clear Walker is deeply considering his plight.  But really Walker can't hold a candle to the absolutely atrocious acting of Tyrese Gibson.  My god where did they find this guy?  The movie would've been OK as a standard, mindless action film, but it really was ruined by the 6th grade drama club acting.  Now you might be wonderning: who's the genius who decided to put these two together in a movie?  But wait, there's actually method to this madness.  Since their was no Vin Diesel, the director knew he had only Paul Walker left.  And it's well known that Walker cannot carry a film (see "Timeline").  So what to do?  Of course!  Find an actor EVEN WORSE than Walker and cast them together!  All of the sudden Walker doesn't look so terrible, because everyone's focusing on this other chump.  And apparently it worked, because a lot of people enjoyed this film, and there's even a sequel.  
 First you get to marry a doctor, then you get bored and become a Bohemian, find some drawbacks there and so finally you get to marry somebody that understands and appreciates you.  You get to take care of and understand animals as a veterinarian.  But your life still seems to miss some spark and so a murder mystery is thrown into the mix.  All of your friends are affiliated with Harvard, Berkeley, or some other high prestige place--no Illinois State or blue color workers for you.  This was a truly awful book written for dreamy status-seekers with no empathy or understanding of the real world 
 What is wrong with the filmakers here, the first film was a neat thriller, even if it lost its suspense element toward the end, it was still chilling, I had high hopes for this one, especially since C.Thomas Howell decided to return, only the first 20 minutes are good, In this one, 15 years has passed since the first film's events, Jim Halsey(Howell) has for the most part put that nightmare behind him, he is now cop himself & leads a pretty normal life with his girlfriend (Kari Wuhrer) who is always nice to look at, but keeps having recurring flashbacks especially after a undercover situation goes wrong & he is suspended on his job, he contacts Captain Esteridge who helped him in the first film, & he suggest that he come see him so he can face his fear & move on which means to do so, he would have to travel the same road, Halsey reluctantly does, with Wuhrer, & what follows is Halsey's paranoid behavior as he refuses to stop, even for a wrecked mobile home, it is understandable why he is paranoid, but soon they see a stranger(Jake Busey) who Wuhrer forces Halsey to pick up, Busey's demeanor is that of Rutger Hauer's Hitcher in the first film, & Halsey immediately forces him out at gunpoint, I really felt this film would take elements of 1997's "Breakdown" & have Howell & Wuhrer out wit Busey, it seems that way at first, but instead the filmakers decided to rip off the original, & to add insult to injury, kill off Howell's Halsey leaving Wuhrer to fend for herself, as she like him in the original is framed for all of Busey's mayhem, as kills anyone & everyone & manages to make her look like the culprit, this one even suggest that Busey is the same character that Hauer played, come on, in the original, Hauer's Hitcher is blasted by a shotgun at least 3 times by Halsey at the end, no way was he coming back, but this tries to suggest that, when what they should have done is have Busey somehow related to Hauer, but no they insult our intelligence with this whacked out theory, that he somehow survived, yeah right, Hauer must feel so honored, I would have much rather seen Howell & Wuhrer play cat & mouse with Busey, that, at least would have brought back the suspense element, & Howell's Halsey facing his demons for sure, why Howell agreed to this script is beyond me, I'm sure Hauer was offered to return as well, it is easy to see why he might have passed, Howell should have too, or at least demanded a better story, Wuhrer & Busey do their best to play off each other's emotion, but their talent is completely wasted here, which is disappointing, A "Breakdown" type suspense story would have been better, who knows it might have gotten a theatrical release, you can't fault Wuhrer or Busey, but Howell should have known better!!      
 Like a reviewer below said, this magazine was good a while back. Try back in 2002. It used to have better tips and less filler. Now, it's all filler. Seriously. There are maybe 5 quizzes which don't say much, a "dream decoder" which is complete phooey, and yes, the many tweeny posters that I'd be embarassed to have on my wall, even if I were 11. I grew, but sadly, this magazine did not, let alone stay the same. Nothing is serious in here, it's like the magazines that tweenybopper brats read. Age reccomendation: 9-12  Simply put, this magazine is like M Magazine, but not as infantile 
 This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste. 
 Ok, I admit I'm a dummy when it comes to wireless networking.  This book, overall was not very informative.  Many times the step by step instructions provided were difficult to follow and didn't match up well with what was shown on my PC screen.  There is a ton of "fluff" in this book, I wish they would just cut to the chase and provide clearer step-by-step instructions.  This book really did not help me much.  
 Rairly have I read a book that I hate.  This is it!  Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room.  Tony's fan base just lost one 
 I bought this dvd after seeing a recommendation by a celeb in a fitness magazine.  Bad idea.  I have several fitness dvd's from various outlets and this is the worst ever.  Tamilee even gets confused telling you 4 more - oops 6 more when counting reps.  It is formatted for vcr not dvd.  It is not inspiring or motivating.  Your money is better spent with other products 
 Our Church purchesed 2 Urns.  They were used about 5 times and one burned out.  It does not heat up or perk the coffee anymore. We were very disappointed as they were purchased in March of 2004 
 After reading the reviews I was really looking forward to getting this book. And while I was reading it I was trying hard to like it. But it didn't happen. The book is more about attitude than actually what to say or do to close a sale. But attitude is real important, thats why I gave it a 2 star rating. There are some closes in here where he tells you to lie. Don't know how he does that and sleeps at night, but I'm not going to do it. If you want actuall closes read Tom Hopkins, damn good. Overall I wish I hadn't spent the time reading this and put the time in something more worthwhile. I won't be ordering the closers 2 
 This has to be one of the worst written books I ever read.  I can't believe there are so many ways to say the same thing. So far, Danielle Steel has found a way in the first third of this book.  I just can't read the rest of it. Generally, if a book isn't very good I can suffer through.  This one has gotten on my last nerve.  I had stopped reading her books because they had become so predictable.  But, I don't think I will be reading anymore of her books.  It's an insult to Nora Roberts and Sandra Brown for her to be ranked with them 
 this book blew my ballz.  it was possibly the worst book i have ever read in my entire life.  although i am usually sleepless in seattle, i found myself falling asleep each time i tried to read it.  i advise no one to ever read this godforsaken book 
 I was quite surprised and disappointed with this book.  It is not at all a horror story, not at all mysterious, really it was very boring.   Normally I enjoy Koontz books.   
 I have returned this item to Amazon; I paid $43.99 when they had it in stock. The audio out on this dock is a stereo mini (1/8") jack, the connection is terrible from then getgo, with low volume, distortion, and noise when the jack is jiggled.  I would highly recommend the dock they're currently selling at Radio Shack for $29.99. It has RCA outputs on the back and excellent sound quality, it charges, and the remote has a menu button 
 I had heard a lot about how funny Margaret Cho was, and finally got a chance to watch her video. I find her way overrated.  She does have some funny stuff. She's got a particular knack for doing impressions, and there's some other genuinely funny material.  However, the funny stuff was diluted by the greater volume of material that was clearly just pandering to the audience. She does a lot of vulgar material, homosexual-oriented jokes, etc. that are clearly just there for the "outlaw" value. And she often descends in to abject preaching on topics that seem to either just be things that she's personally bitter about or are designed to ingratiate her to her fan base. It's just... not funny. 
 My main problem with this book is that the author makes sweeping statements and claims about the role of various forms of popular culture in various eras without providing any historical data or close analysis of any popular culture from those times. Instead, he promisciously cites a very broad range of theorists to back up his otherwise groundless assertions 
 This book right from the very beginning contradticts itself, it is full of different code for different things and typos.  I created several pages just as they said in the book and all worked, but had nasty looking error codes all over them.   If you are a beginner, which with a title like this books i presume so, don't even think about getting this. Its difficult to follow at the best of times.  However all the code does work, just not well 
 I was not satisfied with this book after having read Paul Benzequin's book about the same subject.  More time is spent on the court trial of the owners than necesary.  Very little time is spent on the treatment and identification of the victims.  What about Dotty Myles, Shirley Freeman and Jacob Slate to name three of the victims that were treated in hospitals?  What about the index card system that volunteers set up to help identify victims that were mentioned in Mr. Benzequins book?  If someone wants to choose between Mr. Benequin's book about the fire and this book they should read Mr. Benzequin's book! 
 I am studying for an M.S in software construction in Denmark and this textbook was assigned to a course covering Software Engineering this last semester. The semester at the same time was focusing on teaching the theory of compilers and computation complexity.  Being from Denmark, english is not my native language and I must say that the verbose language used in this book sometimes had me pulling my hair. It seems I am not alone when i say that. Most of the reviews here tell about problems with the overcomplex language used.  I am not sure why the outher finds this necessary. There is also much use of references to other (somewhat outdated) books about the subject. I am not sure how many several authors I have read when i finish this one - it must be several. The left-margin is used for key-points, little advices, web-references which is a great idea. But they do take away the focus of the main text.  I cannot say whether or not it presents the material correctly or if something is missing or the information is outdated or whatnot - I just do not like this book. It seems it was written for software engineers already in the field (it is the practitioner's approach) and the only thing they really need is a (grown up) presentation of the methods used in modern software engineering. And this book does contain that - indeed. Atleast it seems like it.  This book is not for students which at the same studies technical courses like compilers and complexity theory. The intended reader for this book was perhaps never meant to produce source code but instead do the management of these chaotic projects. Though, this I am not sure of, since I an not a practitioner - but a hardworking student seeing myself reading this while coping with the immense culture shock it is for me to realize that I do not know anything about developing software.  The book does manage to give away information (if read carefully) and from one perspective it is not just a waste of money. One usefull feature are the examples of dialogs between members working on a fictive software project. They are very informative.  But to use it like is has been done in my situation is just a clear misconception of the reality which lies in the study of the conceptually hard areas of this kind of education.  Bottom-lines:  - You like programming, mathematics, theoretical studies and understand that careful planning and execution of software projects is a requirement - get another book on software engineering. Perhaps the one by Sommerville or McConnels's Rapid Development are good bets.  - You have been working in the field of software engineering for several years but haven't really gotten the touch of programming or have had ups and downs managing software projects, buy this book indeed, you'll cope with it just fine 
 So 'Dirty Harry' is undercover as 'Det. Nick Pulovski' and breaking in a Rookie (the next Dirty Harry?), Charlie Sheen (i.e. "David", who is still haunted by death of his brother while stupidly playing 'chicken' on rooftop when they were kids). Lots of talent wasted here (ex(s):Tom Skerritt as rich Dave's dad  and get this! - Raul Julia and Sonja Bragga  as South American drug runners/chop shop oper- ators - with german accents! Bad ones @ that!) 'Harry', er, ah Nick gets shot up @ the end and gets kicked upstairs - what a way for D.H. to go out, eh? Big budget, sorry language, ham fisted direction by Eastwood, who's ego' is getting away from him and bad performances. Oh, Clint's son, Kyle does good jazz score, "Red Line" in closing credits of ending credits. Too bad he wasn't in here. [He only got to star  opposite Clint in sorry HonkeyTonk Man (**'s)]. Bye, Dirty Harry, the run was more fun than this junk! 
 I'm in my twenties, and while browsing Amazon I came across this book. It sounded interesting and I read several of the reviews. I just received the book and was so disappointed to find out it is written from a Christian perspective. I'm not religious myself, and after skimming the book and seeing references to God and passages from the Bible on almost every page I decided I wasn't interested.   Had I read the reviews more carefully I probably would have realized this. Surely it's a great book for those who are Christian, and those who don't mind the religious perspective, but I would rather read one that isn't written from a religious point of view. I think I'll be returning this, or giving it to one of my Christian friends 
 Being a fan of this type of literature, I couldn't wait to watch this.  But I hadn't read the book.  About 15 minutes into it, I couldn't stand the boredom and never finished watching the movie.  However, if you are a fan of the book and a Thomas Hardy fan, it's probably a must for your collection 
 This book is a waste of time and energy.  The plot centers around a mother's murder of two of her children.  However, the author doesn't take the mother to trial, nor do we find out if she's acquitted or convicted. Save your money 
 Summary: Disjoint and Superficial.  The author had access to an outstanding group of individuals and in many cases squandered the opportunity with superficial questions.  Instead of getting key insights, I felt like I was getting trivia.  The interviews read more like something from People magazine (or maybe a sidebar in a Keyboard/Music magazine) than a highly rated book.  Where is the depth that Kettlewell should be able to provide?  I found it impossible to get through section two.  The intent may have been to be exhaustive in its list of pioneers, but instead I found it exhausting - dry, dull, superficial and disjoint.  In addition the book is poorly edited, as if rushed to publication 
 I happen to be a voracious reader and especially like books with an air of history about them.   I was very keen on reading this book, I liked its reviews and liked its name - found it quite intriguing. But reading it, was quite unlike my expectations. I found it utterly dry and uninteresting. The book seemed drier than the deserts it talks about. I did manage to finish it, though.  I would not recommend this book to anyone 
 As with some of the other reviewers, mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter.  I bought a Vector brand inverter at Wal-Mart and it is much better 
 I saw this dvd and thought it was a bargain .... Was I wrong. It contains 3 great films all spoilt by the worst transfer I have ever seen. The picture is far worse than the vhs I have and it also keeps freezing and pixelating. I have the reg 2 version of Immortal battalion and it is a fantastic transfer. Avoid this dvd at all costs 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 Other reviewers who detail the silly political-correctness and faux-politics are right... This is Clancy-for-dummies.  Ford's Jack Ryan was sometimes a step behind, but in a believable way.  The audience was right beside Ryan, and when he put 2 and 2 together and took action, boy, did he take action.  Ben Affleck's Jack Ryan is terminally lost, pouting and confused while the audience waits for him to figure things out and do something productive (or at least interesting?).  This is going to go down as the "Star Wars Prequel" of Clancy movies--the one you try to forget exists as part of the saga you love. 
 I found after reading the first part of this book i became very depressed.  I had to stop reading it because it made me feel very helpless 
 I had recently got the cutest little Persian Kitten.  As a new cat owner I purchased this book to get information specific to the breed.  Outside a few pages of breed information, history and pictures, everything else was just general cat information.  I would have expected more on breed care, grooming, and health concerns 
 Heres a new one....I have recently bought two spindles of these discs, and my computer (Imac w/ Intel chip-hardly outdated) simply doesnt recognize them-like I never put in a disc at all.  The kicker is that this spring, I also ordered two spindles of these discs (exactly the same as far as I can tell), from which I burned one hundred discs (not a single faulty one!) for a freind overseas.  I have no idea what the deal is, but have a feeling that the issue is not the quality of the discs.  Anyone got ideas? 
 well i'll explain that later. she uses her own vocals. she doesn't even have the balls to let the artists who rework the song use their own vocals.I love how the editoral review uses the term "unique vocal TALENT". Yoko has no vocal talents. I must also point out I am Courtney Love's number one fan, so this should give me even more cred.   It just proves how narcissistic and disgusting yoko is that she won't let other artists do an album using their own vox. She loves the sound of her own too much!  I already went through that stage where I made everyone listen her as a joke. I was about 14 then. My point here, this isn't even a good joke.   Its just dumb.  I listened to the song clips provided on amazon. even that was too much.  if you must, just download this album for free. Do not buy it. Do not in any way support this woman.   I wish there was a zero star rating. 
 There is essentially no topic in this book presented with enough quality information to allow the reader to make any consistent profit from FOREX trading.  If you picked the book up in a bookstore and wrote a list of the topics on a piece of paper, you would have a place to start your search.  In other words, don't waste your money.  The only reason I did not "hate the book" is because the information is essentially accurate.  But trading FOREX successfully (actually any successful trading) is difficult.  In this market you are trading with or against enormously deep pockets who know more than you.  If you want some alternative ideas, consider these three:      1.  Currency Trading; Philip Gotthelf; Wiley; 2003      2.  Day Trading the Currency Market; Kathy Lien; Wiley; 2006      3.  Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom-second edition; Van K Tharp; McGraw-Hill; 2007 
 The #1 CD was a turn off and disappointment because the author constantly jokes about nonsense. I waited and waited to hear his view regarding what he had to say about living a life of inner peace. By the time the tape was over I got nothing out of it. I can't believe what the hype is about Tolle. It was a turn off to consider listening to #2 CD but I listend. I've been a spiritual metaphysical researcher and investigator for over 35 years. And having heard of Tolle's personal past experiences and issues was why I wanted to hear his input. But I was left with no significant point regarding how he recc.living life with inner peace 
 The information printed by Amazon.com in their description of this book bears little relationship to the new Pelican paperback. The paperback is a facsimile of the 1911 edition. I myself wrote the description used here by  Amazon to describe the Pelican book. What I wrote refers to the Quellen  Company's enlarged and annotated edition, which has foreword and  introduction, and six appendices telling about the publication of the  original book, the two plays produced from the book, and the silent movie  made from it. Also, many illustrations not in the original book, or the  Pelican paperback. A lot of original research went into gathering and  putting together this material. I believe the description may convey an  erroneous impression to prospective purchasers of the Pelican book. I did  not authorize the use of this material to describe any other book than my  own, because, oviously, it does not describe any other book! Signed:  Quentin Burke, editor of the enlarged, interpretive edition of  "Barbara" and of the commemorative edition of  "Barbara." Both are hard cover and both are obtainable from  Amazon.com 
 Yet another typical fluffy bunny book masquerading as something sinister. That's chic nowadays. What garbage. She's a lovely lady, I met her at a festival once and briefly chatted with her, but her books suck eggs. Sorry Gerina but that's true in my book.  Wanna learn real sorcery? Try Tarostar, Brujo Negro, Brother Moloch, Chuck Cosimano, or one of those guys. They're dark, mad and won't hold back the truth. Look up their books and see what you're missing.  Save your money. I traded this book away to some kid for some Pokemon cards for my kid's collection. Yeah it's that bad 
 It's sort of sad that a book being advertised as being  "Completely Revised" is completely the same. Even the date on the CD is 2003! I have the version for Illustrator CS and nothing has been changed between the two volumns, NOTHING! So save yourself some money and buy the version for Illustrator CS if it available. I'm so mad that I purchased this book I could scream. But instead I'm just going to rate the book with a big, fat one star. Maybe the author will get a clue for her next version 
 Pros: 1. Usually accurate 2. Tracking software works well  Cons: 1. Poor quality 2. Pressure button gives different results based on where your thumb is positioned 3. Unit freezes occasionally 4. Much too expensive for what you get  This little machine would be worth the money if the company would have put a little more effort into quality. The unit feels cheaply made. Mine is a week old and already a button is broken. The unit also freezes occasionally and also sometimes gives crazy readings for no reason. However, the tracking software works as advertised and is useful.   Save your money and frustration and buy a caliper from a different company and use that with the tracking software that is downloadable from the company website. This product is not worth $70; $15-$20 would be more appropriate 
 Mr. Gerzon offers a lot of good information about leadership and how leaders deal with conflict.  However, his political views are far too invasive and distract substantially from that otherwise valuable information.  For that reason, I would recommend other books about leadership that tend to stick to the topic and not venture to express a certain perspective on an issue as controversial as the Iraqi War.  
 I was very disappointed in the book which I received as a Christmas gift. I, too, dislike the light yellow print which is a strain on older eyes! It is difficult to find the recipe on the page because of it.  This might seem trivial to some; but, to others it is a real pain.  Also, the recipes are nothing special.  I am glad that I did not pay for this book 
 The main Participents, in a debate about the validity of the Resurrection: Gerd Ludemann (anti-resurrection) and William Lane Craig (pro-resurrection), with additional commentary by diverse others. Can anything be learned from the debate? More can be learned by any of a long list of books by unbiased, serious and well qualified theologians. Personally, I do not consider Craig  a theologian at the level Of Vermesh, Ehrman, Meier, Brown, Sanders, Fredrickson, Pagels, Crossan, or any number of others. To me he is more like a TV evangelist, who argues his from his beliefs/prejudices like a politician, where anything goes, not from unquestionable, academic  evidence.  Am I a Christian? Yes. Do I believe that God exists? Yes. Do I believe that God can or could have Resurrected Jesus or anyone else had He wished to do that? Yes. Do I believe that Wm. Lane Craig has a legitimate, argument supported by several independent and unbiased pieces of written evidence, the minimal requirement for a graduate thesis, as required in such an academic debate, in thisbook and this "debate"? A resounding NO!   In fact he cannot, no one can, because, at least at this point there is no such evidence available. The "evidence" he cites is not evidence at all, it is a collection of biased writings by biased men who were not witnesses to the event-if it did happen. Most of the writers of the New Testament were not even born when Jesus died. By-the-Way, if Jesus was born during Herod the Great's reign, and Herod died during or before 4 BC, and Jesus was at least 2 years old or less, Jesus would have died between 25-29 AD, not 33 AD, a difference of 4-8 years, and since we have heard from historical sources outside of the New Testament that John the Baptist died in 37 AD, after Jesus, and that Quirynius was not governor until Jesus was a teenager, thus could not have ordered a census in Bethlehem, 13 years before he was stationed in Jerusalem, and those are merely the least of the Testament's errors, they are not a most reliable source for such a claim. No, unbiased source has ever verified the Resurrection, only those with a strong `bias in favor of such an act of God. None of the above was ever established as fact by any source other than the four canonical Gospels, and the other canonical works. One of which was certainly doctored, all of which were edited, redacted and written, not by Apostles, but by people whose names we do not even know for certain, and written beginning with Mark, at least 37 years after the death of Jesus and ending with John 77-88 years after the death of Jesus. Having said that, this was neither the most thrilling nor best-argued debate. All of Craig's evidence is based on the four gospels and in an academic debate, the very materials which veracity are in question, are not considered evidential. Craig cites the following as established facts, which by rule of evidence they certainly are not. 1) Jesus was buried, (2) Jesus' tomb was discovered empty, (3) Some people report having seen Jesus after his death, and (4) Jesus' ollowers preached the resurrection when they had every reason not to.  The debate is boring to anyone with a solid background in theology, it smacks of showbiz and is not a serious or meaningful thing and serves little purpose. It is more like watching CNBC than the BBC.  Do I believe that Jesus was resurrected? I do, but that is a matter of faith, not tangeable evidence. I give it  2.25 Stars 
 Does anyone still care about this series at this point? I guess I do because I checked the book out of the library. And now I see why there was no waiting list. Simply put, if you feel the previous books had not enough sex and too much plot, this one's for you. Otherwise, steer clear and don't tarnish your memories of what this series and its feisty protagonist were.  Sure, Anita wasn't perfect. The books were occasionally stiltingly written, some characters were not that well fleshed out (Micah, we're all looking at you now) and Anita's sociopathic behavior could be really aggravating and nonsensical. And Ms.Hamilton was often guilty of drawing too many times from the same simile well; how many times have we heard about someone's pulse feeling "like candy on my tongue"? But the concept of this alternate universe was original and the stories were fun. But the fun evidently couldn't last. Every man who meets Anita now must have her or simply die. Who doesn't she have sex with in this book? Nathaniel, Damian, Micah, Requiem (wait-who??) Oh yeah-and Richard and Jean Claude. At the same time. Because, see, that's the only way to share power within the triumvirate or...you know, I really have no clue. Anyways, be prepared to want to shower for the rest of your life if you make it that far into the book.   The mystery has something to do with some strippers being suspiciously killed but honestly I couldn't make it till the end to see what all that was about; I couldn't even make it far enough to see when or if that particular thread was ever resumed. Unlike the Amazon review, I say this is exactly a bunch of sex scenes strung together drunkenly without context. It's like a supernatural key party. I lament I must give the book one whole star. Clearly, I'm not alone. 
 America was formed by Dan Peek, Dewey Bunnel and Gerry Beckley, three US military brats living in London. America generally sounds like either a third rate Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young or Barclay James Harvest (who were all ready a second rate Moody Blues) without any new ideas of their own. This 1975 compliation does however have the advantage of collecting all of their hits without wading through some of the painful filler on their individual albums 
 I wasn't expecting high art when I bought this movie but I was at least expecting good acting considering the cast.  This movie was so bad it was funny.  I watched with a friend and we ended up making comments similar to those on Mystery Science Theater just to stay mildly entertained.  The story was lame (to be expected) but the acting was lousy with the exception of Oliver Reed who was pretty good as the bad guy.  All this on top of a truly hokey sound track.  I have seen other movies in this genre, but YIKES this one takes the cake as the worst by far 
 I think deep thinking people tend to be unhappy because they're not living life.  They're idealizing and rationalizing life.  Some of the concepts here may be good, but reading this book will leave you feeling empty, even if you agree.  It's better to spend the time living your life than reading these kinds of deep books 
 I disliked this movie almost as much I loved Super Troopers.  Not sure if I would say it was awful, but it came close 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 Instead of actually showing any handy numerical processes used to figure out problems, this book tries to tell you via overly-wordy and remarkably garbled explanations in the middle of "real world" situations gathered from statistics.  The authors' idea of "Informal" apparently means burying explanations under useless jargon.  If you want to pass a Calculus class and don't already have a talent for mathematics, this is not the book to use.  Use something that's straight to the point and ditch the "Informal Approach" 
 The index in the version I have is completely inaccurate.  What's more, to obtain errata you're required to enter a code on the publisher's website.  This code is not stamped on the book but is on the packaging which I unfortunately threw away before I noticed the index was completely inaccurate.    Save yourself the headache and get a different version 
 The title of the book is very inviting but, unfortunately, the author doesn't prove equal to the challenge of the subject. Mainly, he reiterates ideas of the colonialist-leftist school of Indian history 
 This stroller was great for a year and a half. My only complaint until now was the sunshade.... it doesnt block much sun when up and falls off when down and seems to always catch on things when folded... but I could deal with that for how light and easy this stroller is. It's easy to steer one handed when needed and folds down very compact. However, now I am suddenly having problems with it folding while in use. It does it with both my 2.5 year old and my 9 month old, so its not related to weight. Every time it's happened I have been right there, so there have been no injuries, but I am leary to put my children in it now. I contacted Chicco and was told, "Sorry, you are out of warranty" Their products carry a 1 year warranty, and I purchased mine a year and a half ago. I only gave 2 stars because it was 4 or 5 star worthy until it started folding on its own,..... otherwise I would try to give it no stars. Every Mom wants to feel that their child is safe, and I am now uneasy about the safety of this stroller 
 I generally enjoy reading biographies, but this one was an exception! A very boring read! I did not think that Lincoln was being portrayed as overly religous as another reviewer did, but I seriously doubt that lincoln had evangelical inclinations. I was dissapointed in the lack of overall perspective of Lincoln's life. I feel that there was too much concentration on Lincoln the politician (his political development) and not enough about his family and social life. I wanted to know Lincoln better on a personal level and I did not feel that this book provided much insight. I may have been expecting too much, but I prefer a biographry that maintains my interest rather than puting me to sleep, as this one frequently did 
 he cited a fan's thank you letter to congratulate himself and support his thesis(p.107), the fan thank him for dumping silver at 7.8 when it quickly fell to 7, (and could go lower according to the prediction of his system), silver since then kept on rising and is at 13 now, he never satisfactorily explained why gold and silver kept rising despite heavy net short by the commercials, this book is useless except let you learn some terminologies for bluffin 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 When I reviewed THE STREET LAWYER recently, I mentioned that I've never put down a Grisham unfinished and that we should throw the man some props. For that book, certainly. For this one, nope. I read four chapters, 41 of its 391 pages, and gave up totally unengaged and uncaring about any of his characters or his plot. I hope he just had an off day or something, and that what he wrote later got back to what makes him so readable. 
 If you want to understand something about movies, read the classic texts on which some of the great directors formed themselves: Ejzenstein, Pudovkin, Bazin, Arnheim and stick to them. In this book which I couldn't read but for a third, you find essays on many aspects of film viewing and making which, in the best of cases, any film fan already grabs intuitively, without so much wordage being spent on them; others that are just an endless exercise in rehashing liminar theories set forth by other obscure "students" for the twenty people who care to read them; others try to reach conclusions on themes which are just waiting for some other academic theorist to reformulate them and that, being generally based on psychoanalisis, are generally undemonstrable. 
 I agree with some other reviewers.  Much of the information in this book is seriously outdated.  As a native Chicagoan, I was surprised to see that the China Club was listed as a hot spot.  Well, I hate to break it to you,  but the club doesn't exist anymore.  As a matter of fact, the China Club  was turned into residential lofts at least 3 years ago!   Overall, this is  an adequate reference guide, but double check your info before embarking on  a trip 
 There is no clear organization in this book. Seems like they took many papers and at random picked paragraphs out of them. The only place they show organization is when they are introducing stuff in a chapter. Works as a reference book because you can look in the back and find the 6 or seven places your topic of interest is scattered in the book. but in general the gain of knowledge through the organization of this book is near to impossible. The authors of this book should be ashamed of themselves for doing such harm to Chemistry students 
 This is a REALLY bad book.  I was very disappointed in the complete lack of authenticity of the recipes.  That they should be simplified is something I've come to expect, but that they should be so inauthentic is inexcusable in this day and age when Chinese ingredients are so widely available--in supermarkets, Chinatowns, or online.  Here are some examples:  In the section on ingredients, Ms. Liley includes (Vietnamese) rice paper wrappers (although the Chinese do in a very few cases use a type of rice paper wrapper, it bears no resemblance whatever to the hard, glassy Vietnamese kind); she states erroniously that Spring roll wrappers are made of rice flour (see Eileen Yin-Fei Lo's "The Dim Sum Dumpling Book" for the authentic recipe and method); and she labels as wonton wrappers, which are square and egg-based, potsticker/gyoza wrappers, which are round and water-based.  In the recipe for Pearl Balls (p.26), she lists short-grain rice instead of glutinous rice for the coating, and suggests that the rice be soaked for 30 minutes.  I have been making pearl balls since I was 16 years old, and you *must* use glutinous rice, because even short grain non-glutionous rice won't soften in the relatively short steaming.  Also, the rice needs at least 1.5 or 2 hours soaking.  Finally, Ms Liley in recipe after recipe suggests fish sauce (widely used in Vietnamese, Thai, and Filipino cooking, but never in mainstream Chinese) as, presumably, a substitute for light soy sauce, since most Chinese recipes specify light soy sauce (or a combination of light and dark soy sauces) for fish or seafood-based dishes.  The photos are exquisite, but what good are glamourous photos when the content is so falsified?  Better to take the extra money and buy Lo's dim sum book, or the book "Dim Sum" by Rhoda Yee (the text is excruciating, but the recipes are good and really work), or for those who really want to get into this in depth, the dim sum books by Wei-Chuan Publishing 
 Love the matching sugar bowl that comes with this butter dish, and the butter dish is very pretty, however it is too small!! or short rather.. you put a standard cube of butter in the dish and it squeezes the top of the butter and gets stuck. The lid does not touch the bottom of the dish  until you have used most of the butter. Also it has to reach room temperature, so it becomes molded to the shape of the lid better, which in turn makes a mess. Really, very unusual and it drives me nuts. I do not recomend the butter dish, sadly 
 I recently bought this card to add on to my HP desktop computer. The card went in easy enough, but that's when the problems started. I put in the disk that came with the card, but over and over my computer wouldn't recognize the card or the program on the disk. I kept having problems occur one after another and other programs starting to fail due to this mess. After almost losing the computer on the second occasion, I was forced to take the card out of the computer. All problems ended immediately! I've had no problems with Belkin's cords and wires, but their cards and hubs, I've had nothing but trouble. Do yourselves a favor and don't get this item. It could cause you nothing but your entire computer to crash. It's not worth your hard earned money to see your computer crash and burn, is it? If you need to add a card, find yourselves a different brand. I, myself, am going to try Adaptec. Hopefully that one won't cause me the problems that I have gotten with this one 
 As a long time hobbyist, im not really impressed. This book doesn't really touch on too many of the 'hard' issues one would face when first getting started with applescript. The languages syntax, for example, is not as intuitive as its description suggests. Its english like, but its not english, and english takes a decade or so to master.  The book says little about the language, and a disproportionately large part of it is just a series of example scripts categorized by the programs being scripted.   This book is more like the answers to the test than the course that would prepare you for the test. I learned close to nothing from it.  Im sure it has its place, but as someone pretty familiar with programming, I find that practical examples _aswell as_ some deeper, language directed discussion is nessesary to get anything other than a weak grasp on any language. Especially a language as slippery as applescript. But I guess I got what I paid for... its a pretty cheap book 
 I have read many adoption books, and found this one to be the least informative.  Many other better books available for less money 
 When I bought this book I thought it was going to give recommendations for a balanced diet that is good for your Ph levels.  What I got was an all-out assault on meat, dairy, and fruit.  Here is a very brief review of this book for anyone who doesn't have the time to fill their head full of garbage.  Your diet should basically be nothing but vegatables, grasses, and a small amount of grains.  If you eat meat, fruit, or dairy your body will become very acidic and little microorganisms will grow in your body and slowly eat you from the inside out.  You shouldn't eat more than 25 grams of protein and you don't need to worry about calcium intake because only meat-eaters need extra calcium.     This diet is only for strict vegetarians and hypochondriacs who are afraid of being eaten alive by invisible fungi if they eat meat, fruit or dairy.  This diet will make you loose weight because you're eating less than 1000 calories a day.  It will make you lose muscle mass from lack of protein and you will get the cool side effect of having green poop from all of the chlorophil.    The purpose of this book is to scare you into buying the author's supplements while taking advatage of the Ph theory and capitalizing on people's fears.  Don't be a sucker and fall for an idiotic diet that is one of the hardest diets to follow, very unbalanced, and could potentially be dangerous to your health 
 This was a wishy washy attempt at the truth. The facts are there in parts and pieces, but it was not really put together well. Some of the choices of material are questionable as being truly valuable to the topic. This DVD had an agenda and is not unbiased, and I think it failed at it's overall agenda. There is more than enough information pre-9/11 and post-9/11 to put together something more worthy and accurate than this DVD has attempted to do. If this is the best contrasting evidence to the bush administration that can be produced after all that has happened in the white house and beyond, we are truly in trouble. The truth is out there, and I think this DVD tripped over them and kept walking without looking down and gathering all the facts together. There were plenty of important facts and things said worth listening to on this DVD, but this DVD is maybe worth a glance, but not a long hard look. 
 Read Code Complete by Steve McConnell. You don't need this book. It contradicts itself on several occasions and is totally wrong on others. It's unfortunate and sad how many organizations want to adopt texts like this as their "coding standard". A pamplet-sized book of bullet-points can't make developers competent, but a comprehensive manual of the best in software engineering practices like Code Complete can 
 Anyone who's read this book, or is considering doing so, should consider what has come to light about Judith Miller's reporting in the build-up to the Iraq war (simply do a search on google for "Judith Miller" - see, in particular, the articles in Slate). Miller was regularly writing front page columns for the New York Times which contained sensational claims (now known to be wildly inaccurate) about Iraq's possession - or efforts to obtain - WMDs. One telling detail to the quality of Miller's reporting can be gleaned from her concession in May of 2003 that the now-discredited Ahmed Chalabi provided most of the scoops (aka lies) for her front page stories on WMDs.   Based on the sheer extent of errors in her pre-war reporting, I think readers of Miller's work need to utilize a heightened degree of skepticism when assessing her claims. 
 Good current trend analysis. Personal political bias reflected. Technical errors: Thinks methane is a fuel - it is not, Thinks is clean - actually causes more pollution to make than gasoline causes when burned.  No conclusions on trends, only vague thoughts and recommends positive thinking 
 it was bad in a way but it got better. It was a cool book with a lot  of things most people would not  think of.Yeah 
 The story goes beyond bad. This is a story of three little girls that torture and kill the wolf in a premeditated way. My 4 year-old son was very sad after someone read the story to him in a school interview to preschool. He said to me that it was a bad story, and the girls have done "bad choices". I can't believe this is in the list of books recommended for 4 and 5's.  
 We are fans of this show and are enjoying watching the episodes at our leisure 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 Zweig made his reputation as a market timer, and 2/3 of this book presents a detailed market timing model that incorporates both "money indicators" (e.g. prime rate, fed funds rate, consumer debt) and a basic momentum indicator.  The model is relatively simple and the method is clearly explained.  According to Zweig's data, the system produced remarkable results up through the final revision of this book (in 1996).  But, of course, you have to wonder... The book has been revised four times since its initial publication in 1986...and yet not a single revision in the past ten years.  Hmmmm...wonder why?  Unfortunately, the obvious answer is the correct one.  Zweig's "Super Model", which he touts as "The Only Investment Model You Will Ever Need" (yes, that's an actual chapter title), utterly failed after 1996.  Some other reviewers claim to have followed the model successfully since the last edition of the book.  I don't know what numbers they're working with, but I've done the very tedious work to recreate the signals the model would have given since 1996, using only actual data available as of the date it became available, following Zweig's methodology precisely, and applying it to the Value Line Arithmetic Index (a very close substitute for the proprietary benchmark he uses in the book).  From March 1996 (the last data point in the book) through June 28, 2006, the Value Line Index produced a gain of 222.8% (buy & hold, excluding dividends).  Following the Zweig "Super Model" long-only generated a gain of 95.5% (not including interest income while in cash), and following the model long/short produced a gain of only 18.4% (yes, that's total, not annualized...).  So much for the "Super Model".  As for Zweig's stock picking method, it's a pretty straightforward approach blending GARP and momentum and is very capably summarized on AAII's excellent web site.  Save yourself the time and money and just go there if you want a starting point for stock screening ideas 
 Back in the days of poorly written, bloated, snippet-heavy textbooks, Dummies stood out as friendly, approachable, and simple. However, another generation of clearly written introductory programming books, with advanced yet well-explained code, shows that clarity and good writing supercede cartoons and wonky humor. Probably yoru best best in learning C is to borrow several C books from the library, and find the one that best suits your style. Dummies for C may be worth reading, but I selected another book to actually learn from 
 Racism is just common sense. Some races are superior to others in certain areas. Blacks are intellectually inferior to whites and Asians. This was so obvious as to be non controversial in the time of early America, even to those who opposed slavery as this book makes clear. This truth is no longer important however. How people feel about themselves is more important than anything now. Truth can NEVER be suppressed for long however. Egalitarian dreamers should know that and know that the time when a book like this can be taken seriously will not last long I'm afraid 
 I have lost all I have ever knew of love, - my lover, my best friend, my companion, my heart and soul. And all too many times I have been told,"You are young, and you are beautiful; you will overcome and move on." IT is sad to know that those whom you depend upon for support and comfort cannot say anything to ease your suffering. BUt you cannot blame htem, for when they cannot know your suffering, there are no right words to say. So you seek out books like these, -- searching every possible source for some answer, some peace, some solace that might help you to find the strength to rise from bed each day...... I am sorry to tell you that if it is true comfort and peace you seek, as you rifle thrugh the myraids of books of this sort for just one paragraph, one sentence, one word that might uplift and embrace your broken soul -- you will not find it here. This book is an account of several readings under various circumstances, given in dialogue fashion. Not a source of information. Not a dissertation of the afterlife. My beloved, my first and only love, died months ago of a suicide, in which he had hinted to but I found too late to save him. I seek to follow him, as I know what had drove him to this, and I endure the very same cicrumstances that drove him to end his life. I told him I could not go on without him --- and I know my days are short, because he left me behind. The section in this book on suicide enraged and sickened me, -- how he claimed that those who take their lives are punished and condemend to suffer their death and witness the effects of their passing over and over again in a continuous loop -- I not only do not believe this to be true, but find it to be cruel and demonic at most.  While suicide might to many seem an act of weakness, cowardice, or selfishness, -- if you have not walked in that person's shoes, you cannot know the torment and suffering they have faced all their life. Nor can you know that for all their many nights of crying out to God with all their soul for peace and salvation, and finding no relief, -- that after a life filled with so much agony and angst they should be condemned to suffer all the more. Where is this God of mercy and of of love, the he should suffer his children further in such a way? I bought this book for the very reason that it contained a section on suicide, and I had hoped that it might shed light on what my precious  husband had endured in the last of his hours, -- and if he knew that I was there performing CPR, begging him to breathe, crying out to God to spare him..... but this book, and what it contained, filled me with bitterness and incredible anger that Van Praagh could assume such things. The fact is -- unless you have DIED, and you have TRULY been there -- YOU HAVE NO IDEA of what awaits you beyond this life. But to make the claim that these dear tortured souls who suffered so much in their life that they could not bear to continue are in turn damned to suffer all the more for seeking release is an ugly and horrible suggestion, and I do not believe it for one moment. My husband life was filled with ridicule, persecution, hardships, struggle, disappointment, and failure  - and to hear Van Praagh say that because he begged God on his knees in tears for release and was rewarded with a perpetual hell tenfold worse than anything he had known in life is just dispicable. God will have mercy on my darling, and he will have mercy on me should I join him, because I cannot bear this life without him. And if I am to suffer, -- it can be nothing compared to how I ache without him. So bring it on. You might be gifted in soem degree, James, -- but your personal opinions on certain subjects do not belong in a book in which people seek fact and not your personal bias. May God have mercy on YOUR soul for the many you have emotionally scarred by saying these things which have been heard by the masses who have lost a loved one through suicide. And maybe all you you "psychic" might do better if you would write something ORIGINAL, rather than rehashing and reinstating the same material in your books over and over again and merely changng the title....... just a suggestion 
 This is a decent survey of the American Revolution, with an emphasis on the military history. There is a little discussion of the diplomatic history, and almost nothing about the politics, economics or social history of the time. Lancaster covers all of the battles, but rarely in enough detail to satisfy anyone wanting an in depth treatment of the tactics employed. Of course, a comprehensive account would be much longer. In lieu of better description, he is often content to name generals or other military leaders, and the book is chock full of the names of military units and, for the American units, their state of origin.  It's a celebratory style of writing about American history that's a little dated now, and ultimatately is not a adequate substitute for a thicker account of what happened. Another irritation that the publisher could fix: the maps are next to useless, containing either too much or too little information. More detailed maps of specific battles would be nice, too 
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 I was really looking forward to this book.  A book that discusses the aspects of each of the congregations in the US or world is a great reference tool in understanding what others believe.  Is this book the one to choose for that purpose?  First, I will discuss its contents, pros and cons before giving my final opinion.  Rhodes' book begins with a very short history of the church (4 pages).  He then defines 'denomination,' 'protestant' and gives a description of how to use the book.  The books covers the following churches: Adventists Baptists Brethren Catholic Christian Congregational Episcopalian and Anglican Friends (Quaker) Fundamentalist and Bible Holiness Lutheran Mennonite Methodist Orthodox Pentecostal Presbyterian Reformed  With each congregation, Rhodes begins with a date of origin for the church, census of members and number of congregations.  He then describes their beliefs and gives a chart of fast facts for the church.  There are several added "fast fact" charts that detail theologies such as Calvinist and Arminian.  Each congregation gets 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 pages (except the Roman Catholic Church where 10 pages are written.)  Some congregations have a robust history leading into discussion of the divisions within, such as the Orthodox church.  Pros: --A large swath of churches is covered.   --A good index aids in finding churches.  For instance, I wanted to find out what the Nazarene church was like, and the index pointed me to the Holiness section, which I was not aware they were part of. --There is an index of persons that helps in determining which authors are from which church. --Rhodes speaks from an unbiased viewpoint.  One could not tell he is conservative dispensational Protestant from this writing.  Cons: --Rhodes left out a couple of churches I have wanted to learn about in my town, namely Unitarian.  Granted, many do not consider the Unitarian church to be strictly Christian, but it is a prominent congregation that would be helpful to have in the book. --The book is VERY vague about church beliefs.  Many of the churches described deny the inerrancy of Scripture, but that can not be determined by the wording used, as the writing makes little distinction between those that call the Scriptures inerrant and those that do not.  One must read between the lines or have some knowledge of the church to discern Rhodes' writing.  Views of Scripture is only one of the vagueries, but is the most prominent. --The book does NOT discuss the issues that set the churches apart.  Worship is spoken about, again, in vague terms.  Is Christ present in the Eucharist of the Lutheran churches?  One cannot tell from this book.  (Some Lutheran churches do teach this and some don't.)  Which churches put high focus on speaking in tongues?  One cannot tell from this book.  My greatest critique is vagueness.  Granted, Rhodes could not have been very specific without relying on some theological bias.  But, more specifics could be told.  From this book, it is very hard to tell why there are divisions.  What divides the American Baptists from the Southern Baptists?  Episcopalian from Anglican?  Greek Orthodox from Orthodox Church in America?  Volumes could be written, but little of it could be found out in this writing.     Is this book the one to choose for the purpose of understanding other congregations?  I have to give a resounding no.  The breadth of this book is a blessing and a curse.  He doesn't leave many out, but the book would have to be much longer to give any insight into the differences between the congregations discussed 
 This movie is one of cinema history's seminal examples of a soundtrack carrying a movie to success. "Saturday Night Fever" from a few years before is another example, but that movie could actually stand on its own. Jennifer Beales' torn neck sweater and table dancing routine aside, I don't think this one could.  I understand this movie is near and dear to the hearts of a lot of 80's children, and I will agree this is one of the all-time great soundtracks of cinema. The problem is, the movie's plot is a slow-moving, wasted opportunity.  Physically, Beales is sexy enough to keep your attention, and her portrayal of working-class girl in a man's job striving to express herself was a pretty novel idea when this movie was made. But her unsympathetic personality and mediocre acting undermine her character. Come to think of it, the acting all around is a bit weak.  But that's not the problem. The movie suffers from two fatal let-downs. The first is the plot itself. Feminism-affirming depictions aside, it's pretty simplistic, unimaginative stuff, even for a dance movie. What's worse is how slow it all moves. The drama sequences in-between dances drag on, straining your patience and sympathy for the character's plights.  The other more tragic flaw, since it is a movie about dance, is the cinematography. While it's certainly not the worst cinematography ever, (check out "the Limey" next time you want a headache.) the dance sequences look like they've been salvaged from scraps on the cutting room floor. We're supposed to be moved by Beales' character's natural talent, but for most of the movie we never get to see her do much except walk and pose in a crazy mashup of bad edits. By the time the final dance scene finally comes along, the drama of her audition performance is ruined by drawn-out, bad editing. It almost seems the judges let her into Juliard simply because she was able to stay in the air for longer than a minute.  Perhaps I'm a purist for asking for good dancing onscreen to consist of more than rapid-fire editing. But if it's a movie about dancing, one would think the least they could do is show dancing. Many movies before and after Flashdance managed to get this right ("Saturday Night Fever" certainly did, to its great success), but maybe nobody told this movie's director. It's a shame 
 I own all of these movies already and I can honestly tell you this collection is a rip off. They're asking way too much for so few movies. Now, you add a few more classics and make them all 2-disc special editions, then hell yeah I'll pay $500 for it. But this just isn't worth it, collection set or not 
 The only possible attraction to this gizmo is the price.  With that said it is still over priced.  I purchased my Coby player from a local sporting goods store because I didn't want to pay a lot for a new mp3 player.  I just had a really good one that I spent maybe $49 dollars for, stolen.  And when I went to buy a new one they were priced around $80, $90 and up.  I went with this cheapo item and paid about $36 hoping that if I lose it or get it stolen again it wouldn't be a big deal.  Now I'm begging someone, please take it.  I used it for a few days and did not like the difficult screen menus. You have to scroll with a toggle switch several times just to get to a menu that enables you to play music.  The toggling is not intuitive and you have to jar it several times before it actually moves once.  The view is less that an inch tall and so you really can't see what your playing.  Long story short before anyone got a chance to steal this one it stopped working completely in a couple of weeks.  I just took it back to the store for a refund of my money.  It is well worth it to spend another 10 or 20 dollars and get a decent MP3 player 
 I got this book from the library based on the author's name and the recommendation of her writing from some friends who had read "My Sister's Keeper" and some of her other books.  I eagerly read the first 30 pages, then quickly became bored and even started disliking the characters.  A good writer is supposed to give you enough details about the characters to make you feel as though you know them.  I am halfway into this book and not only do I not feel like I know any of the characters, I don't want to.  They are tired stereotypes who are lacking in depth and personality.  You wonder why Eric and Fitz are so in love with this woman who is totally unlikable.  The character of Fitz is so much like every other "male best friend" you've ever seen on a TV sitcom.  The stereotypical descriptions of the "fringe" characters are so boring.  Of course the prosecuting attorney is an overweight Jewish shrew.  (aren't they all?)  Of course the character of Ruthann is a "tough old" Native American who rarely shows emotion.  Of course the carousel operator is an "acne-scarred" teenager.  I just feel that these negative descriptions and characterizations are purposely written that way to somehow make you feel that the main characters are "better" than everyone else.  Poor little victims, even.  The descriptions of Eric's alcoholic mother were just like any other suburban alcoholic woman ever contrived.  I can't even muster any emotion for Sophie.  Fitz and Eric remind me of two overgrown frat boys and Delia (Bethany) is so self-centered, you almost don't care about her at all.  I hope to be able to finish this book, so at least I haven't wasted my time reading the first half 
 Charles Fort had intelligence, yes. But where do his theories stand now? For instance, his thoughts on the "raining frogs and fish" occurance goes like this: he denied the scientific theory that they were sucked up in a waterspout and made his own: that all lifeforms were created in a giant sargasso sea in the sky and occasionally intelligent aliens dropped them to Earth. He generalizes the entire scientific community in simple strokes, physicists, your doctor, astronomers, chemists, yes, he claims to debunk them all. Is evolution true to Fort? Nope, all life is created in the sargasso sea in the sky: Genesistrine, and is teleported or dropped by aliens to Earth. Crackpot lit 101: Charles Fort 
 My understanding of theoretical and practical physics (pick your subdiscipline) is more akin to catching a glimpse of an intricate structure in my peripheral vision than being able to read the architectural plans. But I do know a good book when I read one. Unfortunately, Gregory Benford's Cosm was not one of them. If he had wanted to explain to non-academics the differences between experimental and theoretical scientists, or to critique the workings of the scientific community, essays would have been a better milieu for the didactic opinions offered in this book. All of these are representative of the way a large proportion of academics see their work and the world, but a better novel would show the reader how these ideas impact the characters through dialogue and action.   The characters are wooden stereotypes alert to racial and sexist discriminations more reminiscent of the 1970s than what actually exists in today's universities (the novel is set in 2005). The clichés make an early appearance with "This far out from the city, people thought of quality entertainment as a six-pack of Coors and a bug zapper" (p. 8) and continue throughout.   All of this is mixed in with a bit of environmental angst as characters note suburban sprawl as an "upscale fungus" and see industrial park developments "crouched down, as if ashamed."   Benford has made modest attempts at providing glimpses of near-future technological advances.   In brief, a particle accelerator experiment of the main character, Alicia, results in the accidental creation of the Cosm, a universe which can be observed (sometimes directly, sometimes not) from inception to death throes. She is (unthrillingly) kidnapped and escapes. She displays rampant narcissism as she disregards authority and alternates between self-doubt and goddess-hood. And she finds love where she never thought to look.

 I bought this CD based on a previous review.  I know that Randy, Paula and Simon would not let Karen Dalton through to Hollywood and would probably look at each other in pure disbelief.  I thought maybe I'm tone-deaf, so I let several other friends listen to the CD.  They too just laughed and said, "NO THANKS".  Keep your money and find some other artist or form of enjoyment, 'cause you won't find what you're looking for here. There's a reason why it took the studio so long to bring this artist to the digital age... 
 Graves confirms that the only way to learn of the Greek myths is to read what the Greeks themselves wrote. If the desire is to understand what the Greek myths actually mean then Graves should be avoided.  Robin Hard, in his translation to Apollodorus' Library of Greek Mythology, published by OUP, writes "the interpretive notes [to Graves' Greek Myths] are of value only as a guide to the author's personal mythology." (p.xxxiii). I cannot agree more.  Graves' immediate failure is that he remains oblivious to the ouranographic nature of Greek myth: their myths were related to the heavens. Further, Graves fails to understand the relationship of Greek myth to the development of Greek philosophy; that the key to understanding Greek philosophy, science (& hence mathematics & engineering), is the mythology. If you read Graves you will understand neither Greek myth or philosophy.  In Timaeus Plato wrote that when the creator "had compounded the whole he divided it up into as many souls as there were stars, and allotted each soul to a star." (Timaeus, 42).  In Apollonius' Argonautica we read of the argonaughts who paused as "the goddess Persephone sent up to them the mourning ghost of Aktor's son, who craved to see some men of his own kind ...[and having done so, he] Then sank down again into the great abyss." Book 2, lines 920.  In Homer's Odyssey we read that "Rose-fingered Dawn fell in love with Orion... outraged at her conduct... chaste Artemis rose from her golden throne, attacked him in Ortygia with her gentle darts and left him dead." Book 5, lines 121-124. When given directions for sailing, Odysseus kept his eyes "on the Pleiads...or the Great Bear [who] looks across at Orion the Hunter with a wary eye." Book 5, 272-274; and once in the Halls of Hades, which lie beyond the horizon, Odysseus' "eyes fell on the giant hunter Orion, ... armed with a club of solid bronze..." Book 11, 571-575  Aristotle explains to us what all this means: "From old - and indeed extremely ancient times there has been handed down to our later age intimations of a mythical character to the effect that the stars are gods... further details were added in the manner of myth." Metaphysics, Book Lambda, 1074b.  If you read Graves you will not encounter any understanding of the heavens, the basis of Greek myth, in which the planets and constellations were the detritus of times past, rendered immortal and writ large in the heavens. This absence is explained by Graves, when he extols his belief that even "the 13th century Excidium Troiae is, in parts mythically sounder than the Iliad." p. 13. What Graves claims is that an author who commented on the myths over 2000 years after Homer actually wrote down the myths, understood them better than the person who expounded them.  Instead of looking to the sky to understand these myths, Graves claims that the only way to properly understand them is when "archaeologists can provide a more exact tabulation of tribal movements in Greece and the dates." p.20; and that consequently "A large part of Greek myth is politico-religious history."(p.17). This is seriously misguided!  Graves as becomes evident has an agenda which he lays bare when he claims Greek & Jewish myth is a product of: "The Jews as inheritors of the 'Pelasgian', or Canaanitish, creation myth.." p. 35; that is that the people of Greece, before the arrival of Greeks were the same people as those who peopled Canaan (Palestine, which is utterly unsupported by any archaeology). What Graves attempts with this ridiculous tome, is to provide a syncretist misinterpretation of Greek myth to reconcile it with the irreconcilable Biblical beliefs and he imagines he achieves this when he weaves into this his "matrilineal v patrilineal" theory as some sort of corroboration. This explains why Graves claimed that a later, Greek Christian from Byzantium, wrote a sounder mythology than Homer: the Byzantine, being Christian, had the same disposition to reinterpret Greek myths to make them more acceptable to a Christian viewpoint, as does Graves.   Greek myths are beautiful if they can be understood. Graves omits the ouranographic dimension of Greek belief because, as he makes clear, he is actually attempting to reconcile it with Jewish (hence Christian) belief. No such reconciliation can work if the author is honest. The Greeks studied the heavens; the Jews were forbidden to do so on pain of death, eg. Deuteronomy 17.2-5 & Jeremiah 10.2. Graves' book is embarrassingly silly.  (... 
 Dont get me wrong, i'm kinda young but i love 80's / 90's movies specially the horror ones.  I had great spectation for early Geoge Romero movies. But both night of the living dead and day of the dead are pretty bad. Gorge Romero is a pionner of the zombie movies and sure a that time they were scarry, but for today standars they are not, even they are not that good for most of the 80's 90's movies.  The Bad:  1. Acting is not beleavible. It looks like the were "acting" 2. The dialog's are not how people actually talk. 3. The soldiers at "Day Of The Dead" are a shame, they are fat stupid and dont have any dicipline. They behave like a bunch of drunken teenages and they are grown ups  4. More than half of the movie you just see them talking and yelling each other. 5. I think is stupid that zombies behave like living humans (listening music, shooting, "talking" ) 6. the only 3 scarry moments are just the tipical fast escenes from a quiet moment. Theres is not any frightening atmosfere .  The Good:  1. The gore scenes are really good, maybe too much bloody. It shows how good in cammera effects are rather than computer generated.   So far the only great zombie movie i have seen, beleive it or not is Resident Evil 1. Resident Evil 1 has it all. Resident Evil 2 NOT. Resident Evil 2 is one those "just shoot and kick" movies and I'm not a fan of cliches or indiscrimanated violence ala rambo.    So if you want a gory movie, maybe you may like this movie, but the gore is just at the end of the movie. You will be better pleased with "Cabin Fever".  If you want a frighten atmosfere and real fear look somewhere else maybe Resident Evil 1, Poltergeist, the original japanese version of The Ring and The Grouch, ScareCrows. Alien, Aliens and even Alien 3 not Alien 4 (It Sucks).  But the Best review is your own so i recomend you rent them and judge them by your own and decide if the worth the price 
 Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre.  Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.  I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.    There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.  I was hoping they would take things too far.  
 No no no.  This book should be titled "The New Family Home for the New Economy", since practically all of the example homes described could only be afforded by folks who cashed in their dotcom stock options in March of 2000.  I hate to bash a book with Jim Tolpin's name on it, but it's hard to believe that this was written by the same guy who brought us "The New Cottage Home" and "Built in Furniture".  The idea is right on: homes should be able to adapt to our needs as our needs change.  But there are more creative ways of achieving this goal than building a separate room for every activity (a media room, a game room, a home office, an exercise room, and on and on and on, all of which, presto-change-o, turn into something else when we decide little Billy needs a PlayStation room or mommy needs a yoga room), not to mention "Great Rooms" scaled to Jolly Greeen Giant proportions. I would recommend "More Small Houses" or "Building the Not So Big House" (as well as Tolpin's other books mentioned above) as better alternatives.  Even if you really do need a bigger house, these books show how small spaces can accommodate more -- more stuff, more activity, more living -- and nothing could be more important in this day of starter-McMansions and  astronomical building costs 
 Not as expected. Does not give off enough lite to read cook books. Appears to be strictly decorative 
 "A skepticism towards all meta-narratives" according to... Jacques Derrida, I think...  This is about all the elaboration that is done on the subject of what post-modernism IS.  With regards to what a meta-narrative is, it apparently refers to a fully general philosophical theory, concerning (e.g.) all knowledge-claims; all justificatory strategies; all moral values, rights, and obligations; all instances of injustice;      Apparently this 'theory' differs from nihilism, but if that is what defines it, I don't see how.             If you actually want to learn about post-modernism, this is not a book I could recommend; internet resources have been much more useful.  The section on modern art history and the crisis of expression was interesting, as well as some other random factoids that apparently relate to post-modernism.  On the whole though, I'd say this is a work totally devoid of substance, and and as I learn more I'm inclined to assign the same description to post-modernism itself.  For a similar, comical, and much more scathing review, see the one below entitled "Trash" by 'a reader' 
 I've enjoyed John Kotter's work in the past. I've found his work useful and effective. However I learned nothing new from this book. The story line is poor and the approach outlined in the narrative to effective change management does not provide any better or new approach.  I'd suggest Stephen Denning's books on business narrative (eg the Springboard) for those who are looking for a narrative-based or alternative approach to facilitate change 
 I would not read or listen to anything this douche writes ever again.  As talented as he is, he is not to be trusted and the"cat is out of the bag" with his players and assistants now.  Watch his demise unfold at Alabamma. His next book will be "How I slit my wrists with a paper cut. 
   This series is a time capsule it shows how TV was then, and gives you a nostalgic look at technical and creative programming. I saw this series when it came out in the 1950's as a child, and now as an adult. I was taken back to a different time in our country. The good and bad points of this series are irrelevant, look at it as people did then. I believe it can be vary entertaining, and enjoyabl 
 I liked the other Eisenstein movies that I've watched.  Alexander Nevsky is a classic and would probably be more of a classic if it were American.  Battleship Potemkin is pretty good and has some stuff that gets ripped off by Hollywood.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  I really wanted to like this movie.  It's about the Russian Revolution but for me it lays things on a little too thick.  I could only get to about half way through the movie (as the horse is hanging off the bridge is where I stop).  Excellent cinematography and music but I couldn't watch more of it.  Way too thick for me 
 it's so obvious there's no chemistry at all between the guy who played the tabloid writer and the woman who played the prime minister. they were just like two actors who signed up separately and had to carry it out and play to the end. there's nothing between them. the screenplay was also quite lame. nothing to be excited about. a quite ridiculous and lame fairy tale. 
 1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:  81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,  90% are gone in 3 months, and  95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.    First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.  Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?  The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.  And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true.   
 I wanted to really like this book--it had a great sounding premise, that's why I bought it without checking with other book readers first. I had to force myself to read until the end. I found the way the characters went from one reality to the next to be unbelievable. Also, I didn't get to know and care about the characters. 
 you have to read it in Russian. You CANNOT CANNOT CANNOT, and i repeat, CANNOT (!) read it in translation- its like trading feces for gold. That is literally what it sounds like in comparison to the original. The specificity, brutality, the sumptuous tenderness of the Russian language are all but lost in these translations of one of this century's greatest poets. Although you might enjoy what you are reading, given you do not speak Russian- you honestly cannot even BEGIN to touch the greatness of Akhmatova or any other Russian poet by reading it in translation.   I honestly don't know who came up with the concept of translating poetry- to me its barbaric. A poem is so brief, it is so immediate and so dependent upon every word- no one should ever touch it. If you want it bad enough, learn Russian. And just so you know, reading Russian poetry in its original form is MORE than worth going through the trouble of learning the language. There is nothing in the world like it- nothing. It beats Shakespeare. 
 Sheer new age nonsense. Don't waste your time. I could pull quotes out of it all day long that would make you laugh out loud, and I'm talking about quotes where Jackson is dead serious. If he is what passes for an intellectual in the NBA, then the NBA is in trouble 
 As most of the Revolution Studios movies, "The Wedding Planner" is not a conventional one. You won't find the classic leading lady with the classic leading guy in the classic romantic-and-predictable-as-usual story. And this stereotype-melting effort is probably what catches our attention. To see couples or situations you normally don't see due to social stereotypes and conventionalisms it is certainly a rather interesting exercise. Having said that, "The Wedding Planner" is also really fun movie to watch. Most characters are great (except perhaps Lopez' italian admirer who is plainly lame). And my other serious complaint is: what's with Matthew McConaughey's hair in this movie? It looks so dry and frizzy and so artifically colored! I think they could have afforded to give the leading guy a more stylish look. On the other hand, passing J. Lo as a italian gal is not very believable (I mean). But on the up and up, J. Lo's wardrobe and hairstyling are remarkably beautiful in this movie giving her a tidy, neat and classy look very distant from her usual flamboyant bombshell persona. Overall a nice entertaining light and funny romantic movie to watch. 
 I think this book is suited for the person who is just getting started in the realm of computer security. This is due to the fact that there is quite a bit of non-Linux specific security tips, like physical security. The downsides to this book are many. Lots of file output and lots of resources to look up but not a lot of content. It just seemed to me like most of this book was filler and I didn't get anything out of it. This is perhaps because I have been involved with Linux and computer security in general for a few years. So, from an experienced systems administrator's point of view: everything in this book is available on the web and can be easily found. However, if you are new to Linux systems administration and security and don't know where to go, this book could be for you 
 Dr. Steven Greer is a well-known figure on the fringe of UFOlogy, and he claims to have "briefed" senior government figures on the UFO issue, but five minutes with this book reveals why few take the issue seriously.  It's an amateurish, sometimes incoherent clip job of unedited, free-flowing interviews with dozens of scientists, pilots and former government/military figures, most of whom say they experienced a highly strange UFO episode (though some of the "testimony" is second-hand).   The firsthand stories can be very interesting and provocative, especially when they purport to cover the government's secrecy, suppression and disinformation techniques. But any impact the content might have is pretty much overshadowed by the hard fact that "Disclosure" is a disorganized, misspelled, contradictory, somrtimes unintelligible, incoherent mess. It's not even "written" in the strict sense -- it appears to be a bunch of interview transcripts hurriedly set in type, not subjected to so much as a simple spell-checker. Names and geographic locations are mangled, punctuation is absent, and the speakers' weird allusions are left hanging. It's hundreds of pages long, but it feels like the world's biggest high school social studies project.   The one consistent stylistic point is that Dr. Greer's name or initials appear over and over and over again -- nobody ever accused him of missing self-promotion opportunities -- but the amateurish nature of the production is a net negative mark against him. It's a mess.  In a foreword Greer says the material was/is so urgent, because it deals with the future of the entire human race, etc., that it had to be rushed into publication. I would like to think the definitive word on the future of the entire human race will be spelled right and look like it came from grown-ups.  Tragically disorganized efforts like "Disclosure" warm the hearts of the disinformation masters, I'm sure, because the UFO movement hangs itself with this kind of stuff -- or at least consigns itself to eternal fringe status. It's a serious subject and it deserves serious coverage, but "Disclosure," for all the nuggets of interest it contains, helps guarantee that the subject won't be taken seriously for the foreseeable future.   
 I bought this as a gift.  The recipe box was in 4 different pieces when I opened it.  The shipment box was not damaged.  It looks like they took a broken recipe box, put it in a cardboard box and shipped it to me.  I called the customer service number, left a message and never heard back.  I would not buy this box nor anything else from this company.  I am extremely disastified.  If I do not hear back from Lipper International I'm going to report them to Amazon 
 E.P. Sanders makes quite a few compelling and controversial arguments in this book.  It has been hailed by many as a great work despite its brevity and I can see why, since it brings a lot of new insight on a pillar of the Christian church.  His thesis: Paul is convinced he has received a message of salvation for humankind through Christ - this message frees us from the law and Paul is willing to use Scripture in flexible ways to validate that message and his own authority to proclaim it. What specifically sets Sanders opinion apart is that he believes Paul's mission has much more to do with Paul's belief in himself and his message and much less to do with what Paul actually can pull from Scripture.  In other words, Paul has an agenda that seems to go beyond just proclamation of God's Word and into proclamation of Paul's authority and the importance of validating his own mission (and conversion).   As a Pharisee, Paul's education in Scripture was paralleled by few.  He was a walking Scriptural lexicon.  E.P. Sander's argues that Paul used his mastery of Scripture to his advantage.  He used `proof texts' from Scripture in order to prove his argument without regard to the original meaning of the passage.  Paul was "not concerned with the meaning of the biblical passages in their own ancient context" (page 66).   Does this sound like the author who has a high view of Paul or Scripture?  Is this the man you want teaching you about Paul?  Not me, thus the 2 stars.  I give it 2 stars because it's nice to see the "New Perspective on Paul" in all of it's glory and in E.P. Sanders' case, that "New Perspective" means a lower view of Scripture and a higher view of himself. 
 I do not have a clue what readers see in this book. I read the reviews and gave it a fair chance. Actually, several chances. I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. I didn't want to waste more of my time. It might be I am new to the werewolf/vampire reads. I do plan on reading about them more, just not from this author. Also.....this book is full of misspelled words. You'd think with spell-check and all, they would've been caught. Not so. Laurell should talk to PenguinPutnam/Jove about that. 
 This book was a very organized.  That is one of the few things it had going for it.  The problem I found was the added zodiac, and the fact that it had no real place.  There wasn't even enough information to tell you about what time of year it was.  And where did the information about this New zodiac "Arachne" come from.  There was good information on the Dark aspects of the moon, But is still can't grasp Arachne and when exactly this happens.  My advice is to take it with a grain of salt and enjoy some tidbit 
 Despite the hyperbolic praise on the back cover--best war novel of the twentieth century!!!--I found this Ballard offering so tedious and unpleasant that I gave up on it just thirty or so pages before the end. My main problem was with Jim; he's basically the only character and he's so unlikable that after a while you just don't feel like spending any more time with him. In Jim you also see the germ of the fascist leanings so evident in the main characters of the truly execrable--but at least readable--Ballard novels __Cocaine Nights__ and __Super-Cannes__.  In my opinion, if you want to read the semi-autobiographical adventures of a boy in an occupied country, you're better off with __The Painted Bird__. If you prefer books about life in prison camps, try __If This Is a Man__ or __The Truce__ by Primo Levi. You'll find in his books the humanity so glaringly absent in Ballard's 
 Although some of the content is interesting, if feels like it lacks organization and structure. In addition, half the book is a shader reference which seems to almost be ripped from the Microsoft DirectX documentatio 
 Type Cooper's name into Google and learn about what a nut job he really was.  He allegedly threatened a neighbor with a hand gun.  A court issued an arrest warrant.  When two deputy sheriffs attempted to serve the warrant he shot one of them.  They returned fire, killing him 
 This book was utterly a waste of time to read.  My artistic nature and love for good literature was completely offended by the sacrilege of this exceptionally ridiculous plot.  Granted, the idea is to convey the trapped woman vs. the time of the late 19th century and the ineffectual struggle countered by many women.  But the plot serves to indicate nothing more than a crazed woman who abbandons her family, life, and morals (all of which were under no concern or abuse) and utterly leaves all those around her in a daze regarding her ridiculous behavior.  I clapped when the fool drowned at the end of the book.  
 My son loved his r.c dirtbike.  It rides really well esp. in the dirt and asphalt but broke the first day he played with it.  Sad for him 
 The title of the book says that it is going to expose the roots of anti-semitism in the Gospel stories, but the only thing that the book does is tries to disproove Brown's death of the Messiah. Though it has one or two good points about anti- Judiaism compared to anti-seminism, it doesnt say very much about anti-semitism. Its more about trying to disproove prophesy 
 This book is filled with inaccuracies. I know that it can be difficult to seperate myth and legend from historical fact when it comes to the history of electronic gaming. For example, look at the variations of the story of Pong in Andy Capp's bar. Unfortunately, even some of the captions next to pictures are wrong.  If you're looking for a book about the history of electronic gaming, I recommend The Ultimate History of Video Games (ISBN 0-7615-3643-4) by Steven L. Kent. However, inaccuracies aside, this book is good as a visual aid to supplement Kent's book. This book is filled with pictures, while Kent's book is filled with text.  Also, do not expect this book to have a very long lifespan. It is glue bound and the pages will start to fall out after repeated use 
 The book is easy to read and moderately informative but useless as a textbook for a course in critical thinking. About a third of it is just incomprehensible because of the "folksy" writing style. Ex: Ch 4 opens, "Reasoning is often taken to be the hallmark of the human species. Colloquially, reasoning tells us 'what follows what.'" That's the best definition of reasoning you're going to get in that chapter! Errors of reasoning are rampant throughout the book. The first chapter opens with a barrage of statistics to show that CT is not adequately taught.Ex: You will live into your '70's so what do you need to know to be prosperous (as if all knowledge for the entire future needs to be acquired today.) The book is riddled with wrong definitions and erroneous information. The chapter on hypothesis testing is especially egregious in that regard. There are few references later than 1991 (in the 3d edition). Finally, the chapters do not speak to each other: There are completely unrelated chapters on memory, logic, and probability theory, for example. The book might be useful in a course on rhetoric or communications, but critical thinking it is not. The chapter on analysis of arguments is the one good one, but it doesn't redeem this... paperback 
 I thought I was buying a book that would give me insight into my cat's world. What I got was a joke book and the punchline is always "Your cats just not that into you." Ok, I get it. I guess I'll take the author's advice and take her to the spa, and drop this book off in a donation bin along the way 
 I had to read this in school as a kid. The actual writing talent here is great but the subject matter is really depressing. I think a good story should have a nice balance of good/bad events. Steinbeck has none of that in this book. The Red Pony is just one dark cloud of doom throghout the entire book. Things go from bad to worse as the little boy's dreams are shattered. Some parts of it are also needlessly gross and bloody and I must admit that as a kid I was a little emotionally scarred from it! The book goes ubruptly to a totally different and unrelated story. As an adult I know it's meant to serve as some sort of metaphor but I still don't like this book and think it's a pointless read unless you want to be depressed or have a thing for tragic stories. I know it's supposed to be a classic, the problem is I don't know WHY! Some readers say "this is a great book for readers of all ages" but I would have to disagree! I don't think this is a kids book. I don't think kids should be forced to read this at school and I don't think I would ever read it again. 
 It's just what it say "a primer".  This book seems like it would be great for someone who has never programmed for embedded systems.  However, if you have even a few months experiance under your belt, this book is a big waste of time.  I purchased this book to use a quick refresh after being away from embedded programming for a few years.  Sent it back after reading about 25% and skimming the rest 
  The only thing Milton Friedman has going for himself is that he says out loud what other reactionaries will only whisper.   Ayn Rand would have loved Friedman's disdain for the poor--for anyone, in fact, lacking the "initiative" famously shown in a 1963 cartoon in which Barry Goldwater stands in front of a poor person in a Southwest ghetto and says, "Why don't you show some initiative? Why don't you go out and inherit a department store like I did."  If you think the status quo was ordained by God, or that capitalism is the best that humanity can come up with, this book is for you. If not, start reading Trotsky, Lenin, and all the people with vision, compassion, and utter disgust for the sad mess that the fat cats have made of this planet.   
 It's another one of those literatti illnesses... "Oh, wait, the writing style is spare? Then it must by Raymond Carver-esque!" As capable as the writing is, the realizations of the protagonists of these stories never hit home for me, the epiphanies never seemed to... piph... enough, or whatever epiphanies do, as Carver's did. If you like your fiction in the "huh? oh, i get it... sort of... i think...", then this may be for you. The man certainly has a buzz about him. But if your taste generally runs toward the sharp, 70 miles an hour clever type of literary fiction, walk away, my friend. And oh yeah, Richard Ford? I don't think s 
 NOVA isn't what it used to be.  The BBC Series "The Planets" contains much of the same subject matter, presented more accurately with interviews of more relevant people 
 Well, i dont want to parrot the reviews below me but this stuff is horrible. Aw...did fat goth chick lose her boyfriend. oh wait this is just another manufactured chick rock/metal group that is a sorry excuse for music. for better music with a girl singing, check out OTEP or Lacuna Coil. For even better music, check out Dannys review and his other reviews. Please avoid unless if you fall into goth chick/guy category for another band to leach on to and looking for someone that feels sorry for you. KITTIE SUCKS 
 since there is little to no mystery involved in the story.  I should have expected this, since this has been the trend for the last 4 or 5 books in the series.  I had put off reading this one for precisely that reason but needed something to read for the weekend so I decided to give it a try.  The best thing that can be said about this "Turkey" is that it's a quick read, so it's good for a plane ride, but if you want something that remotely resembles a mystery pass this one up and read one of the first books by this author which really were engaging and satisfying mysteries.    Even as a glimpse into the small town life of Moose County this one falls flat.  It used to be that one of the charms of the series was the way Braun had developed the world of Moose County and all the foibles of its inhabitants and if tragedy struck one you really felt for them.  In this book, characters from previous books are randomly introduced and they wander around aimlessly and there is no emotional depth to Qwill's relationship with any of them.     The other problem that has happened to the series is that Braun fell in love with her own character.  Qwill started the series as a flawed charcter.  In "Turkey" there is even more rapturous description of Qwill's mustache and wonderful voice than usual, not to mention the ovations for the ridiculous Big Storm production.  We are supposed to believe that it is so well received that there are to be several performances a week throughout the summer - how big is the population of Moose county?    SPOILER ALERT:  But to cap off the ridiculousness of this book, Qwill leaves his beloved Koko out in the gazebo with a confessed murderer who is strung out on drugs.  The Qwill of past books would never have intentionally put either cat in danger like this.    According to her fan club web page, she was born in 1916 so now she's pushing 90.  It's possible she's in poor health. Because of this I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt and agree with those who suggest this book was ghost-written based on notes she made.  That would account for inconsistencies in plot and style.  The only good part of this book - the only reason it deserves even one star - is the description of YumYum playing with her thimble (but even it is taken from another of Braun's books).  It's on page 72 - read it, then find something else to read.          
 It's just a direct "copy" of the marketing classics by the same authors "Positioning". Not many new idea there 
 If you want to be scared and paranoid through your first pregnancy, then this is the book for you. This book has no insight on anything. It is vague. It doesnt explain anything in detail. It talks about every possible thing that could go wrong but probably wont. Each chapter lists all the symptoms you might be expeiriencing, but that is as far as that goes. Its not a very good book to turn to you if you have concerns because it will just make you have more! You might as well ask your doctor because this book constantly refers you to your doctor. It has no insight or answer for anything unless you have a high-risk pregnancy 
 Director:  D.J. Caruso Cast:  Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke, Kiefer Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Oliver Martinez, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hughes Anglade, Paul Dano. Running Time:  109 minutes Rated R for violence, gore, language, nudity, and a scene of sex.  It's no crime to emulate that which is successful. Hollywood 's entire history, for better or worse, is based on studios, producers, directors, even actors, tapping into that which is au courant and using to their own best advantage. It's only when a moviemaker so blatantly rips off another that a hew and cry goes up about cinematic plagiarism (re: Brian DePalma's unabashed love affair with all things Alfred Hitchcock, so vividly on display in such films as "Carrie", "Dressed to Kill" and "Body Double") Even then, while those films can be accused of being rip-offs of their superior progenitors, at least they are good rip-offs. DePalma's brand of obsessiveness appears to have afflicted director D.J. Caruso with his sophomore effort, the new suspense thriller, "Taking Lives", starring Angelina Jolie, Ethan Hawke and Kiefer Sutherland. Caruso's work reeks of so many other latter day suspense classics (such as "Seven" and "Silence of the Lambs"), yet he doesn't appear to have learned his lessons well from the masters.  Jolie is a special agent for the FBI who is called to Canada to help with an investigation into a series of killings that appear to be connected. Jolie's character, we are told, has a special affinity for this kind of work. She's the type who garners clues as to the psyche and motivations of the unknown killer by lying down in the site where a victim was found. Ostensibly, she has some kind of extra sense about serial killers, something known to the Canadian Chief of Police, a former comrade (and possibly lover) of hers when they trained together at the FBI, and a trait that some other, highly chauvinistic Montreal cops (i.e. "Unfaithful"'s Olivier Martinez) don't buy into. Her investigation leads her to a woman who tells police she has just seen the son she thought died nearly twenty years, a young man she admits is very dangerous, a shaky eyewitness to the most recent of the serial killings, an art dealer played by Hawke, and a suspicious and mysterious man played by Sutherland. The police believe they have zeroed in on the killer, who has some connection to Hawke, so they use him as bait, but as is the case with these movies, all is not what it appears.  Director Caruso borrows heavily from the look and feel of such films as Silence of the Lambs and Seven. Much of Taking Lives is shot in dark, dank basements or closeted rooms, shards of light penetrating through cracks in the walls. Dismembered and/or rotted bodies tumble from secret hiding places, dropping into frame right on cue for the maximum on the scare monitor. The problem is, we've seen all of this before, and most people get a weekly dose of this kind of ghoulish forensic foray on television with CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, so the scare tactics never really initiate the same fright sensibility.  The all-star cast does their best to rise above the pedestrian screenplay, but even they are hamstrung by the script's mediocrity. Jolie, putting in perhaps the most mainstream performance of her career, is sensual, sexy, tough and determined, the quintessential female heroine in the mold of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. Unfortunately, her character has too many vestiges of Foster's, with the exception of the eroticism that simply comes with being Angelina Jolie. Hawke is all nervous ticks and twitches that almost give away too much, while Sutherland, on hiatus from his heroics in TV's 24, gives perhaps the film's most subtle performance, seductively menacing.  "Taking Lives" has everything it takes to be a first-class suspense thriller, but somehow falls short, particularly in the film's climactic moments. The denouement is nowhere near as satisfying as one hope for, the suspense long since having been played out so the life is taken out of "Taking Lives" 
 Hey this is for everyone buying cameras over the world out of the united states, I have a problem with my camera and I don't have anyone to help, I've been trying some help in amazon's help area but they just have thousands of links but any simple email where I can ask for some help, I don't really understand why is this site so well known on "customer service", but I just cannot communicate with no one in the company to ask anything, I'm just mad about this, if anyone can help me to contact amazon or fujifilm please post an email or whatever cause there's no such a thing like help in the "help area". I need to repair my LCD monitor of my camera, it's really fragile, so if you're still thinking on buying in this site or even buying something from fujifilm, don't do it, they don't care about the customer satisfaction at all 
 I was upset that I wasted my money on this film.  The film is extremely overrated.  At best it should have only gotten 3 stars.  I do not see what there is to like about this film.  It was not funny, the plot was stupid, everybody's running around trying to find a diamond and the movie just ends so abruptly, not a comfortable ending at all.  If you have never seen this film I highly suggest that you rent it before you buy it.  
 The author tells us little about John of Gaunt, but a lot about his personal inclinations.  I quick read but with little substance 
 Simple ideas.  Was not very useful for my work environment. I was looking for something that was a little different or unusual that we haven't tried 
 There used to be a (hilarious) tounge-in-cheek review that made the comparison to the computer utility "ping".    I went looking for it, and it is not posted here anymore!  (One of the other reviews makes a passing reference to the "comparison to operating systems", so I know I'm in the right place.  What happened to your sense of humor, Amazon????  
 Hey, I shoot for a living.  I was hoping this book would help me shoot perfect scores.  Like the title states, "Master Handgunner".  Well, I wasted my money.  This book tells you nothing.  Pathetic 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, "The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea," provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: "The REAL Rapture".  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's "The REAL Rapture" (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site, prophecyhouse dot com, for details on these items) 
 The seller made a mistake and did not have the title in stock. They had later sent me an e-mail apologizing for the error and credited my account. 
 Before I get started, everyone writing about the whole "it's one disc while Hardy gets two" agrument should know that this 1 disc is around 4 hours long...the same length as all of TNA 2 disc DVD releases.  Now I see this DVD as a complete disapointment...it's almost a throwback to the older WWF Home Video's they would have on their wrestlers with the longer matches being clipped & the non-important short matches being shown in full.  Other DVD's such as Jeff Hardy's were filled with a bunch of filler matches from Impact while Christopher Daniels is one disc full of actual matches worth paying $$$ for and they're all clipped or real short except for the Ironman Match with Styles from Against All Odds & the Ultimate X match with him & Styles from the next month.  But that's not saying much since you can get that match & the entire Ulitimate X match (they cut out the elimation parts with Primetime & Killings beforehand) off two other TNA DVD's (Against All Odds [Ironman], Destination X [Ultimate X] & The Best Of The X Division [Both Matches]).    The only thing I can say positive about this is that the timeline format they had for this DVD was well done (his first TNA match to the union of Triple H to the wars with AMW to his domination of the X division).  And they went all the way back to the start of TNA in Nashville & not just start to their move to Flordia like they've done with alot of their DVD's recently but they really should have had more matches that weren't clipped complete.    Hope this isn't the future plan for other TNA releases.  BTW: Here are all the matches on the DVD since nobody else put them up.  1) Low Ki vs. Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper and Kid Romeo and Tony Mamaluke and Jerry Lynn in an elimination match at 6:22 (July 10, 2002). CLIPPED  (2) Christopher Daniels & Low Ki vs. America's Most Wanted at 3:57 (March 12, 2003). CLIPPED  (3) Christopher Daniels & "Primetime" Elix Skipper vs. Chris Harris & James Storm at 6:28 (April 23, 2003). CLIPPED  (4) Christopher Daniels & "Primetime" Elix Skipper (w/Low Ki) vs. D-Lo Brown & A.J. Styles at 8:55 (May 14, 2003.)   (5) Christopher Daniels & Primetime (w/Low Ki) vs. Chris Harris & James Storm (June 18, 2003). CLIPPED  (6) America's Most Wanted vs. Christopher Daniels & Primetime in a cage match to win the tag titles (June 25, 2003). CLIPPED  (7) America's Most Wanted vs. Christopher Daniels & Primetime at 2:50 (Aug. 11, 2004.) CLIPPED  (8) Christopher Daniels & Elix Skipper vs. America's Most Wanted at 2:13 (Aug. 18, 2004). CLIPPED  (9) Christopher Daniels & Elix Skipper vs. America's Most Wanted (Aug. 25, 2004) CLIPPED  (10) Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Harris went to a 10-minute time limit draw (Impact, Aug. 26, 2004). CLIPPED but only because of commercial break.  (11) America's Most Wanted vs. Christopher Daniels & Elix Skipper in a cage match (Turning Point, Dec 5., 2004).  CLIPPED  (12) Christopher Daniels vs. Buck Quartermaine (Impact, Jan. 21, 2005). Squash match that last under a min.  (13) Christopher Daniels vs. A.J. Styles went to a 10-minute time limit draw (Impact, Jan. 21, 2005).  CLIPPED but only because commerical break.  (15) Christopher Daniels vs. Chris Sabin (Impact, March 11, 2005).

 This would have been an interesting and original view of the problem of persistent poverty in the U.S. had it been published, oh, about thirty or thirty-five years ago.  As it is, it grossly oversimplifies a complex problem, and worse, plays to the cherished superstitions of neoconservative intellectuals and their `lumpen' readers alike.  It will probably come as a great surprise to the author, but I doubt poor black, Hispanic, and hell, even poor white kids have ever even heard of Norman Mailer, much less studied his essays in school.  It may also have escaped the author's attention that inflation whittled the value of payments from programs such as Aid to Families with Dependent Children down to a fraction of 1960's levels, even factoring in occasional cost-of-living increases-which had all but ceased starting in the 1980's.  Finally, under the impetus of a conservative Congress, the Clinton administration undertook reform of "welfare" in 1996 which included drastically tightening eligibility requirements, placing strict time limits on receipt of benefits, and actively directing recipients into jobs.  Yet poverty seems to persist despite the implementation of conservative nostrums and even more amazingly, despite a near-full employment economy at the end of the 1990's.  In other words, trying to blame everything on kids who grew their hair long in the 1960's, and vapid socialites hobnobbing with Bobby Seale at Leonard Bernstein's soirees forty years ago is not only not right-it isn't even wrong    Meanwhile, since the Nixon administration we have conducted a "War on Drugs" that has stuffed prisons full to bursting with (mostly low level) drug dealers and users-nearly all of them minorities--but accomplished very little else. Although crime rates have in fact dropped to historically low levels, this seems to have little if any correlation with incarceration rates, which have been relentlessly rising since the 1970's.  This decrease in crime, by the way, confounded neoconservative predictions at the beginning of the 1990's that crime-allegedly inspired by our evil culture-would continue spiraling upwards without letup.  Similar decreases occurred in out-of-wedlock births, but as an old saying goes, "A lady's reputation seldom improves."  Especially when she is a member of a racial minority, I might add.  It would seem that the underclass owes very little to the 1960's counterculture, although Encounter Books-once a source of urbane and intelligent works-would probably not have taken Mr. Magnet's manuscript had he concluded as much.  Neoconservatives, it turns out, are as rigidly locked into a mindless party line as the 1960's leftists they criticize.  For example, black social scientists such as Glen Loury and William Julius Wilson were clutched to neoconservative bosoms when their research found that blacks suffered relatively little racial discrimination in hiring compared to past decades.  They were dropped like hot potatoes however when their continued investigations showed that minority unemployment had a lot more to do with factors such as the virtual disappearance of even low-skilled work from most urban areas, and the lack of transportation to exurban areas where most job growth was.  Kind of makes blaming the 1969 Woodstock festival look silly, to say the least.  There is no doubt that there is something that was once called "the culture of poverty" that inculcates some of the poor with self-defeating attitudes and behaviors.  This was already old hat by the time "London Labor and London Poor" was published during the Victorian age.  Presumably, the Victorian poor did not become or remain so because of Janet Jackson displaying her bosom on television a century later.  There are innumerable other criticisms to be made of this book starting with its confusion of drug-taking behavior among the poor (which tends to seek oblivion from hopelessness) with middle-class drug taking behavior (which is usually risk-seeking or thrill-seeking), but a complete enumeration of its mistakes, misconceptions, and half-truths would take an essay nearly as long as the book itself.  Suffice it to say that instead of being random, the errors all seem to point in a certain political direction.  Readers may conclude what they will about the author's presumed good faith from this.  Those looking for `just-so-stories' to confirm their darkest prejudices towards racial minorities and justify doing nothing will certainly find what they seek in this book.  Those looking for nuanced discussions aimed at trying to solve problems instead of finding scapegoats will have to look elsewhere 
 I am a great Julian Simon / Björn Lomborg fan, but this book has a limited number of mostly useless diagrams, especially from non-US perspective. But any other Simon book 
 So I bought this movie because some of the reviews said that the acting was terrible but the dancing was amazing.   Well, anyone who thinks that the salsa dancing in this movie is amazing, awesome, good, or ok, has never actually SEEN salsa dancing!! I am a salsa dancer, and this movie was HORRIBLE!!!  I have seen amazing dancing, and good dancing.  This was TERRIBLE dancing!  And there was hardly any salsa! It was 80s dancing to salsa music!  That's IT.  The only time there was actually salsa dancing was when the main character was training with the club owner.  Other than that, it was just 80s dancing to salsa music.  That's it.   If you want to see salsa dancing, I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this movie.   If you want to see horrible acting, and old 80s dancing, then I recommend this movie... There was only one thing that I liked about this movie.  The appearances made by Tito Puente and Celia Cruz.  That was great to see, but not worth buying the movie for....   Oh, and the story line?  What was it again????   Yeah... I love movies, good ones and bad ones. But this one???  The WORST movie I have seen so far...  To the best of my knowledge, there aren't actually any movies with really good salsa dancing.  Hopefully, someday, there will be 
 Dont dwnld " Survivor, "Thunderstorms & Sacrifice" ". Its my fault for not reading the whole thing. you would think that the last episode would be the finale , but NO, its just a 10 minute recap going to the finale 4. I didnt even get a full 45 minute episode. No finale. I got rippped off. $1.99 dwnld not well spent. Dont bother dwnldng any episode of fiji if you dont know the ending. Because they dont have that episode, not even the reunion show 
 These dishes are everything they say they are EXCEPT the embossed pattern does not in any way, shape, or form resemble a fleur-de-lis, but rather looks much like a scorpion or bug, complete with a body and legs. The smaller pattern in between the insects resembles a marijuana leaf. So...if you want to impress guests with bugs and pot leaves on your serveware this is the set for you 
 This book is full of information, but none of it hit home for us.  We came away with only one idea that we are actually going to use and found many of the sayings and toasts to be very cheesy 
 An alternate title for this book would be "Captain Underpants Aces Graduate School (Extra Bonus: 'Frickin' Gratuitous Pseudo-Swearwords on Every Page !)".  I purchased this book based on positive reviews that confused the distinction between lewd and stupid - lewd I can handle.  This book will be relished by life members of the fart & burp club who wish to obtain a graduate degree with the least effort. It largely ignores the concept or utility of graduate education.  Perhaps the book relfects the biases of the social sciences, but my grad students in the natural sciences would skin me alive if I assigned a book that squandered so many pages on the excessive trappings of extended adolescence while instructing them carefully in the art of dodging.  Its key redeaming features are a collection of excellent quotes and written caricatures of professors in the social sciences and humanities - the authors must know my dean 
 Is it any wonder this book has received no reviews? That would presuppose a level of bona fide "kulchur" among the modern masses. Instead, Pound enjoys a neofolk vogue because he was interested in Fascism and used a few euphemisms to refer to Jews. Neofolks LOVE that kind of ambiguity. Maybe they'll read the Cantos, and consider themselves fans of Pound, while completely missing the point of his work, contained in such books as the "Guide".  But you can't hold it against these innocent egotists. You can't expect scenesters to be genuinely interested in kulchur and old books. They want to LOOK COOL.   Read this book if you ENJOY POUND'S PERSONALITY and are concerned WITH YOUR LEVEL OF KULCHUR 
 I read this book and I felt like none of my questions had been answered.  The questions were all very common with infertility, but I was looking for guidance in how to deal with them.  I didn't get any help.  It was kind of  like the authors were trying to be kind and not take sides on the issues.   I wanted the blunt answers to use when dealing with infertility.  Example  if you are invited to a baby shower and didn't want to go.  It was all well  you can go and avoid the opening of the presents and blah blah blah.  I  want to know if this feeling is normal and if I don't want to go I am not  being a bad person 
 I've read over 150 thrillers/mysteries during the past 5 years and this novel ranks as one of the five worst. The story is a complete bore and the killer is so perfectly obvious that it seems that the only way the author keeps the story moving is to include monotonous drama about a sexually abused teenager and an emotionally limited inspector. The title, the ending and the loose ends are all meaningless and disappointments. The moral of the story: don't pay attention to the rave reviews on the inside flaps 
 First off i just want to say that i've read "The Secret of the Old Clock" and it made this game even more boring because i knew the basic outline.  I see in an above review an adult of the age 35 loved it, which i can understand. But I'm 15 and i found this game OVERLY boring. The puzzles were way too easy, and driving around in the horribly done car part of the game made me want to quit playing. It says youll get a pay if you do some chores for people...i didnt get anything. Although I love herinteractive and and i love all the other nancy drew games i would highly reccomend you dont waste $19.00 on it. I would only reccomend getting it if it was in a value pack of Nancy Drew games 
 This guide is horrible!  Okay, the walkthrough is decent, but who needs a walkthrough for this game?  Seriously... this game is very straightforward.  The best reason to get a guide for it is for weapon, item, and monster lists.  This book is very incomplete.  While there are at least a hundred new weapons and pieces of armor, this book only lists about fifteen.  The monster lists are also very bad, many monsters are missing, and for the ones that ARE listed, the items they drop are not.  Bradygames posted updated weapon/armor lists on their website, but they are still missing all of the rare weapons in the game as well as the monster info.  A very rushed book, not worth your cash.  You're better off just finding a FAQ online 
 Short version: A half dozen scientists and engineers are working in the arctic, attempting to use explosives to create a huge iceberg that can floated to someplace in dire need of fresh water. They become marooned and only have a few hours before the explosives they've planted go off and kill them. However, a Russian sub may be able to save them.  Koontz had the right idea when he originally released this book under a pseudonym, because it's a stinker.  The set-up building to the scientists being stranded and the deadline imposed by the explosives is unbelievable. Suffice it to say that a natural disaster hundreds of miles away just happens to target the exact location of where the scientists are working. Additionally, they've planted explosives in the ice that are on timers and can't be switched off.  Besides suffering from incompetence, the characters have unbelievably bad luck (beyond being targeted for destruction by Mother Nature, that is):   -One is highly phobic, terrified of (you guessed it): ice & snow (because of an accident that killed her parents)! -Another's family was murdered in China -Another's had close relatives assasinated while in office and is disillusioned by politics (a thinly disguised JFK jr?) -Another lost his son to cancer -Another's psychotic  If that's not bad enough, the main characters are a husband and wife team who run the project. She had a relationship with another scientist that ended badly before getting married to the current guy. So who does her husband pick to spend months on ice with? Why the ex-boyfriend of course! Because he was the best at what he did (excuse me, wouldn't second best have made more sense?)  If you don't mind really bad dialog and trite situations, give this book a try. If you want a really intense adventure/thriller try Wilbur Smith's "Hungry as the Sea" or anything by Nelson DeMille 
 Heinlein, best known for his science fiction, was over his head in the fantasy genre.  He has many die-hard fans that are loath to criticize any of his stories, but believe me, the fantasy is second rate at best. Try Jack Vances Lyonesse trilogy for high fantasy at its best 
 Morris believes that the Bible can be scientifically proven.  This is impossible, since the Bible is a religious text.  It is an interesting read, but keep in mind that Morris uses bad science and fallacy after  fallacy to make his religion look scientific 
 Hey, look: Another book on writing with nothing new to say!  Get Lukeman's two books and, if you've got a spiritual streak in you, Brenda Ueland's 'If You Want to Write' as well. 
 Gee i wonder if these guys thought anyone would fig them out..  check out the reviews of people that "reviewed" this book.  Suprise the overwheming bulk of them have only one review.. this book...   I wonder if Colker wrote all of them himself or had his friends do it..  DO NOT BE DUPPED.   this book is ok  at best..  nothing i mean nothing you cant get on the net for free 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 I think the book could be interesting and educational for children, it just doesn't carry the punch it should because there are no photographs - only cut paper collages.  While I certainly do appreciate the artistic  value of the illustrations, part of the allure of Everest is seeing the  majestic, and terrifyiing, landscape. Keep the wondreful collages, just add  some photographs. The Khumbu Icefall just can't be captured in a collage 
 This is my first review for Amazon.  I write this so that some reader can avoid the pain I suffered.  The book was the worst mystery I have ever read.  Wild plot twists have been mentioned by others, nonsensical plot twists are a better description. I found none of the book to be believable and must admit the the only reason I finished to the book was to see if the final half was worse than the first half.  This book was factually wrong in so many ways. Here are a few; 1) The prices listed were off. 2)College professors held office hours late on Friday afternoons. 3) Someone was paid with $1000 dollar bills.    I will give away one plot twist.  Someone has been stealing rare books for months.  Someone is given a contract to kill a girl two weeks before the first attempt is made to kill the girl who happens to be reading the rare book.  The brillant detectives assume the book thefts are to a smart way to cover up the murder.  I would have found the book less offensive if the plot twist was that young aliens were playing with their parents' time machine and that the aliens had given the murder contract in order to prevent their parents' from discovering the youthful indecretion 
 the only thing i liked about this book was the introduction. i am a white, professional, upper middle class female, 40 years old.  there wasn't any story that i could relate to.  most of the women went to ivy league schools, or at least seemed very upper class and snobby.  i can't imagine many people really relating if i couldn't.  also a story about a woman who had sex with her best friends boyfriend and struggles with the idea that that friendship ended...hmmmm, what a surprise! i can't think of anything more ridiculous and boring to read about.  get real.  that's what i say about the whole book 
 I defenitly agree with all of the others. Some of the stories were good... Like 3 or 4... the Sarah Dessen one, Sarah Mylnowksi one, Sonya Sones and Megan McCafferty's own also the Interview one and maybe one or two others. Others were complete and utter crap. Like others said... sometimes i didnt even know if the characters were girls or boys and some of them were just plain wierd. I recommend borrowing it from the library and reading only the stories you want... this isnt a good book to read cover to cover. I guess ive lost so respect for Megan McCafferty on this one. This is defenitely not a good present for a soon to be sixteen year old 
      I had high hopes for this book since I thoroughly enjoyed and laughed out loud while reading Bryson's 'In a Sunburned Country'. I was more than a little disappointed after finished `Lost Continent' I came away feeling more than a little disappointed.      Before I bought this book I was puzzled at the contrasting reviews here and I initially took the most of the negative reviews with a grain of salt. I figured these were written by people who mostly just took offense way too easily and were unable to laugh at themselves as Americans. I have to say though, after reading the book I find myself agreeing with some of the negative reviews of this book.       First off, as an American that has lived overseas for 3 years now, I feel I'm more than capable of looking at America with an objective eye. I'm completely aware of America's many shortcomings - ie.  the propensity for urban sprawl, the seemingly declining interest in it's rich history, the ever growing dependence on technology and increasing laziness that invariably comes with it etc. etc.     Having said that, I still regard this book primarily as just one endless, tiring, repetitive rant by an unhappy man. One would be hard pressed to find more than a couple instances where Bryson spent more than three of four sentences at a time describing anything he found ENJOYABLE. As one reviewer pointed out, Bryson comes across as being exactly like the kind of people he constantly complains about in this book...rude, ignorant, and, just like Bryson himself, overweight (apparently he hasn't stepped in front of a mirror lately). One has to wonder why someone would put out a book that is so consistently sour in tone. If I had just finished such a thoroughly unsatisfying and unhappy trek as this, I would be hard pressed to come up with a good reason (other than a quick buck perhaps) to actually write a book about it. Let me get one thing straight, if this were a book about Canada or anywhere else outside the U.S. I would feel the same way. Yes, there are a few funny passages in his book, but his air of superiority along with the overuse of metaphors pretty much dampen it at times. As demonstrated in `In a Sunburned Country', his strength lies in sharing facts and history of the places he finds himself in, and the humor is always much more engaging when it isn't over the top and written as if he's trying to impress himself.        There was a span of about 12 years between the writing of `Lost Continent' and `In a Sunburned Country', and it shows. This is a younger Bryson, a man who seems to have a problem with every little detail, and it becomes increasingly tedious and irritating as the book goes on. He rarely displays anything other than contempt for the places he finds himself in. A couple of other reviewers also made valid points when they found it curious that (with the exception of his Iowa drug buddy) he never manages to engage anyone in anything resembling a meaningful conversation to actually get a handle on their mindset (as he did in "In A Sunburned Country' for instance). His interactions with locals are mostly limited to ordering food at local restaurants and asking for directions. He seems perfectly content coming to conclusions about entire groups of people based on no real substance and communication whatsoever.       In this book, sadly, he comes across as nothing more than a sarcastic, anti-social loner with a bone to pick with just about everyone and everything. Any remotely kind words he has about anything (and they are few and far between) are all but smothered by the sour tone of the book as a whole. I SO wish I could recommend this book for others to read, but I'd be lying if I said it's time well spent 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD

 Once again Catherine Coulter has written a very stupid book!  I could not believe she could actually call this a love story. If I want to read porn books, I would go to the adult shop. I hate the explicit sex scenes in her  books. I am looking for love, not lust. And then to have an uncle who would  treat a neice this way, like a sex object, come on Catherine. I hate her  books and have read quite a few, almost all hoping for a good one. Well  there have been maybe 2 out of the 100 or so she's written. Jade Star was  my favorite. She is drawn out and boring in most of her books,and she  always overuses words.Can't she come up with any new ones? Don't bother  with this one girls, yuk 
 Don't purchase this one. It's a pointless, plotless waste of time and money. It goes absolutely nowhere for 3 hours. From the write-up, we thought it was going to be a good movie. Wrong! It turned out to be a total waste of our family's time. We threw the DVD in the trash 
 I thought the title was interesting so I bought this book.  Wow, what a disappointment.  This is sappy and poorly written.  How does Mitch Albom keep  getting on the best sellers list 
 My pump just up and quit after several years...and it didn't always work great, but when it did, it was ideal. So I'll replace it, but with some other product, not the Cuisipro again. 
 I wouldn't order from Andrew Christion again!  I ordered three shirts more than a month ago.  They sent only two and never responded to my emails!  Where's my shirt!!? 
 These two huge volumes are mostly white space. A typical page has two wallet-size photos and a few words of text 
 The menue pops up and then the disc freezes on pressing of any button.  Not sure if only my disc is defective or a whole series. This is the first of 9 HD DVD's i have a problem with.  update:  same problem with the replacement of disc sent by amazon. It does not play on the xbox 360. will now contact manufacturer of disk and microsoft for potential firmware update of player. update 2:  FIRMWARE UPDATE;  on nov 30 a message flashed over my screen , that an "update is available for this game"   i updated and the disk is now playing wonderfully.  another great bonus of playing hd-dvd's over the xbox 360,  how easy it is to update firmware!!  would like to change the rating to 5 now because the concert is superb 
 It's World War I. There's death and dispair and darkness everywhere and yet amidst all the anguish, there comes the tale of two lovers and their sad struggle to live a complete life. It's the daring anti-war classic from the late great Ernest Hemmingway- A Farewell to Arms!  Sounds pretty promising, huh? Let's see how it REALLY is.  First things first, the Lovers- Fred Henry is an American in the Italian army. He begins the story feeling rather mildly about the war and life in general until he accidentally falls in love and things begin to change. He is a totally self-absorbed, unsympathetic dick. He narrates the story and yet somehow we get little insight into any of his deeper emotions or motives. I literally hated him by the end. Catherine Barkley is a beautiful English nurse who Henry falls for. She's still healing from her last lovers death when she meets him. At first she seems like she might turn out to be at least somewhat intresting, but the hope vanishes everytime she opens her mouth. She is  shallow, moronic, ridiculous, and one of the most unrealistic and dislikable females characters I've ever read. Henry, however, falls desperately in love with her and her thick head of blond hair.  Next we have the plot- As you know, it's WWI. Things aren't going so well. Henry mets Catherine. Henry gets injured and falls in love with Catherine. They spend almost all their time remarking how "sweet" and "fine" the other is and reassuring eachother they're really in love. Then they have some sex and Catherine gets pregnant. Henry cares somewhat. He's then forced to go back to war, however, but not before Catherine tells him she feels like a whore when he takes her to a hotel. This is the only intresting thing she ever says but she quickly retracts the statement as to not upset dear, darling Henry. Yadda, yadda, yadda. Henry deserts the army. This is one of the few exciting parts. Unfortunately, though, Henry soon goes back to Catherine. This is where is book takes a turn for the worst. The lovers breifly share happiness until Catherine has her baby, the baby dies and at last Catherine dies. Tragic.   My Opinion- The book is dull. When Catherine died I was just glad the book was over. The prose in this novel is some of the most boring and terse I've ever read. The dialouge is some of the most irriating. Between Henry's emotionless "Yes", "No"s, and "All right"s and Catherine's pointless, opinionless chatter, I'm not sure how anyone could be grabbed or moved in the slightest. Neither character had much going for them and I couldn't care less about their miserable fates. Hemmingway could have turned this into something so much better if only he gave his readers some likeable people who we could love and relate to. I don't know about the rest of you, but I thought his was the biggest waste of an idea ever. Cheers 
 The Ying Yang Twins definitely aren't one of my favorite rap groups. Sure, they can make a few stupid songs like "Say I Yi Yi" that get radio and videoplay for awhile, but as far as a really good album, no they can't do that. I'm giving this album 2 stars because it has "Say I Yi Yi" and "By Myself" which are hits that were enjoyable for a few minutes. This album might really be worth a dollar, but thats being generous. If you enjoy listening to a group of people who want to make noise instead of music, then this is for you. If you want good rap music, then go pick up Tupac's greatest hits. 
 It all depends on who you are if you will like this book.  Republicans will like it but Democrats or people with brains won't. 
 I didn't like this item very much because it seems to have terrible quality. It already came with a loose thread. But it fits good.  
 Bland, bland, and more bland.  It seemed to be trying for some kind of emotional resonance, and fell far short of the mark.  With the except on the main character's mother, nearly every single character was completely unlikeable.  And a little Lea Delaria goes a long, long way.  It does replicate the 80s very well, but it just feels so devoid of humanity 
 The music in this CD is beautiful, the lyrics are lovely as well. The fact that I don't like Michael Crawfords' voice might have something to do with this...Gerard Butler was the first Phantom I heard.... so I hold my standards to him. Michael Crawfords' voice is nice, I'll admit, but give me Gerry any day. Perhaps Michael DID have a voice suited for the role, and perhaps Gerard Butler didn't, but I'm partial to emotional songs to wooden-flat ones, and baritone voices to tenor voices. Sarah has a lovely voice, but in my opinion, it is a bit too mature for the part of a 16 year old girl.  But don't let this stop you-buy this CD...you may love it, you may hate it. Just compare Michael's voice to Gerard's voice...the difference is rather laughable 
 I can't say that some of the essays weren't well-written, because they were.  My problem was the content.  I'm not Mrs. Brady by a long shot, I thought I was forward-thinking, a feminist, a hip-mama, but apparently, if you want to stick to the confines of this collection, if you aren't on welfare, a single-mom, or a teenager, in an alternative relationship or all of the above, you aren't from the "New Generation of Mothers". Personally, that's okay with me.  I'll just go on being a good mother with a secret punk rock past & realise that by having planned out my pregnancy with my husband when we could afford it that I'm just one of those supposed-SUV driving soccer moms that all the other parenting books cater to.  Shame on Ariel Gore for being so narrow-minded in her view of the new generation of mothers.  Shame on these supposive feminists for being irresponisble in their breeding & then claiming it a victory for feminism 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 When the truth about 911 is known he must not escape justice. He is a criminal and must be treated like one. Christian Peper  
 All the cut shapes are the same, so it's very easy for my 3-1/2 year old to force pieces in the wrong place. The pieces also seem thin and flimsy. The coolest thing about the puzzle is the lunchbox/carrycase. All in all, the quality is much less than I expect from Ravensburger .  The Ravensburger "Thomas Giant Floor Puzzle (24 Pc)" is a far superior product, but no longer complex enough for my kid 
 While I am an advocate of the Leap Frog line of products, this one was advertised in such a way that I believed I was getting a "whole product." Unbeknownst to me (1st time Dad @ 50), this was an accessory to a product that requires the initial purchase of the e-book, etc. While I have had nothing but praise for Leap Frog products and will probably seek out the components to use it, it was disappointing...and a lesson learned re caveat emptor; buyer beware 
 A smarter person than I once said, "It seems impossible for Bruce Dickinson to release a bad product."  Well, unfortunately, this seems to be it.  I won't delve into the contents - plenty of other reviewers have done that.    The live performances are certainly full of energy, as is typical of Bruce.  The video is below average at best.  While this isn't a hidden feature (it's been described a number of places, including the booklet with the DVD), the major disappointment is the sound quality.  First of all, it's only provided in dolby digital stereo - no surround sound.  Secondly, the live performances sound remarkably flat.  In fact, the sound for the second DVD doesn't even match the quality of the CD for this show.  It's too bad, because a good quality sound could have made this an awesome DVD 
 I was disapointed when I downloaded it and got 8 pages. As a customer, I expected to have the digital version of the full book and not a summary. I thought that the price difference was due to the absence of paper, printing, handling, shipping, etc. The hardcover version is more than 300 pages; if you take the price per page of the digital version, the hardcover version should cost then ten times more!!! All the examples are referred to that version and nowhere I was said that I was paying 5 dollars for a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT PRODUCT.  I honestly believed that I was buying the full book. I will think better before ebuying again... 
 I picked up "Reasons to Live" based on Chuck Palahniuk's sterling recommendation in his book "Stranger than Fiction." Hempel's collection contains 15 short stories -- very short as the pieces average about 8 pages each.   Her writing is very clever (as promised), but left me uninterested. The tiny length of each story made the characters and their situations too opaque to care about. Hempel can certainly write a great sentence, but not a great story.   One footnote: "Celia is Back" clearly mirrors a story Palahniuk tells about his own father. I must admit to wondering if some of the high praise came from personal association more than objective evaluation.  
 I really can't understand how a person can't include the title track. Well not exactly the title track, but when it was first released the album in the U.S. they changed the album title from A Quick One to Happy Jack. But anyways, it's outrageous not to include the original recording of Happy Jack. It's like not including Simon and Garfunkel's Bridge Over Troubled Water on the album Bridge Over Troubled Water. It's like not including Bob Dylan's The Times They Are A-Changin' on the album The Times They Are A-Changin'. It's like not including the Beatle's Magical Mystery Tour on the album Magical Mystery Tour. I think I made my point. It's a shame. I suggest downloading the tracks that were on the original album from iTunes to make your own A Quick One/Happy Jack. 
 I've tried this twice now, and both times it had an off taste.  A bit rancid, like it had been stored for too long at too high a temperature.  I'd guess that Amazon's transport or storage has a problem they need to work out 
 Unfortunately, the stool arrived in its box without the seat. As we needed one quickly, we purchased a similar stool locally. We returned the stool and Amazon was quick to give us a refund. The manufacturer who sent these out evidently needs some quality control 
 I expected to find this book stimulating and informative, but came away feeling that Dennett is vastly overrated and quite ordinary in his thought process, logical skills, and writing.  This book does not explain or offer a theory on -- as its title promises -- what consciousness is; it merely offers a lot of random observations on and stories about consciousness.  Dennett seems to start everything he writes somewhere in the middle of a conversation he has been having with himself; he doesn't know how to properly introduce a topic to the reader.  He begins the book not with an overview of his subject or a presentation of a thesis, but with a chapter on hallucinations -- a very specific area of consciousness.  I indulged it with the expectation that it would provide an entry point into a broader argument he wished to advance; instead it was just the first in a random string of narratives.    I suggest that in lieu of Dennett's writings on consciousness, one read John Searle or Robert Ornstein.  Or if you want an engaging, conversational style of writing on the subject, look into Oliver Sacks.   
 I bought this book while researching the Logarithmic Spiral.  There were only a few references to the Logarithmic Spiral, so it wasn't spot on with what I was looking for.  However, I stayed away from this as a source because the text was difficult to read 
 I just graduated with a major in PR. This books lists 88 jobs in advertsing and PR. However, it is out of date. In the PR industry there are: bloggers, web site developers and other internet position. This books lists NONE of them. In advertising, some positions (like print traffic manager) are almost non-existant. This book needs to REMOVE old 1990's job titles and ADD the jobs that firms are hiring for in the 2000's. This review is for the 2006 version of the book (4th ed). I think the author has gotten lazy and needs to do a complete overhall. This book may be of use if you are looking for a job in PRINT advertising, but most advertising agencies seem to want a person with good design skills and not just newspaper print. This book NEVER lists web skills or HTML that many employers seek today. Sad 
 Are you sure this is not a misprint?  Who in their right mind would pay $114.00 for a DVD? 
 This small edition is a bummer.  The print is much too small to be of any practical use.  Don't try to save money.  Get the regular-sized one 
 Perhaps it's because I'm new to stevia, but I haven't had one recipe from this book turn out. I'm wondering if I'm using the "wrong kind" of stevia. Even after the explanations given in the book of the different types of stevia forms, I'm unclear on just which of those forms I'm using compared to what is being used in the book. It might be more useful to actually give brand names so those of us who are beginners have a better chance of success. As it is, I've had to throw away everything I've tried so far because, not only were they not sweet, they tasted just plain nasty. My most recent attempt was the Dark Chocolate Almond Clusters. As soon as I added the orange rind the chocolate turned into a thick clump. Then I kept trying to add more and more and more stevia to it, even though it was now very difficult to stir. It never became even close enough to "sweet" to be edible. Again, I just threw it away. I don't have enough confidence in baking with stevia now to even attempt any more of the recipes 
 And these people are from Seattle with their hometown band?  The crowd is pathetic, come back to Wisconsin and record a live DVD, we'll give you all we have as an audience at EVERY show.  Geoff Tate hits the notes, he just need Chris DeGarmo back to back him up with his soaring vocals a la LiveCrime, then you have a perfect show 
 It's about time someone attempted to publish a 'legal' version of the 'illegal' Real Book, the standard text that virtually all jazz musicians use to enable them to play together.  But it's  unfortunate that Hal Leonard was the company to do it, because they still have not gotten it right.  For those that don't know, rumour has it that the original Real Book (editions 1 thru 5) were originally created by music students at the legendary Berklee School Of Music, who began transcribing the heads (melodies)and chord progressions of the jazz standards that they most often played and binding them into a book that they xeroxed and shared amongst each other.  The only problem is that they never got permission from the composers/publishers of the music and consequently never paid any royalties to said composers/publishers.  When comparing the 'illegal' 5th edition of the Real Book to the new 'legal' 6th edition, the first thing you notice is that several songs are missing from Hal Leonard's 6th edition.  I assume that's because Leonard & Co. was not able to get the rights for some songs, or couldn't get them at a rate that would still allow them to achieve the profit margin they were shooting for.  Though disappointing, that's perfectly understandable.    However, what I can't understand is why they decided to publish several songs in different keys than they were originally presented in the 5th edition.  Yes, John Coltrane originally recorded "Equinox" in the key of concert C#, but for years it's been played by what what must be millions of jazz players the world over in the key of C, as it appeared in the original Real Book.  Instead of following what the 5th edition did, Leonard chose to publish it in C# in the new 6th edition.  Though I'm sure more and more people will eventually buy this new 'legal' version, it doesn't change the fact that millions of people still own the old book and therefore countless numbers of people will continue to want to play it in the 5th edition key, either by reading or from memory.  So why change the key, making the legal and illegal books incompatible?  Or, if your sense of order compels you to publish the originally recorded C# key, why not include a second version in the 5th edition key of C, so that everyone has a choice and can be on the same page?  One of the things that people have always complained about regarding the illegal 5th edition (and those that preceeded it) is that the sheets are full of notation errors.  Some have been corrected through the years, but the number of errors still abound.  The musicians usually hand correct them themselves as they come across them, or just remember where the errors are and adjust accordingly.  One of the exciting things about Leonard's legal version it that it advertised that it was completely accurate, correcting all the prior errors.  Nothing could be further from the truth!  I'm sure there are corrections that have been made, but the Hal Leonard version is still full of errors, and it's both appalling and completely unacceptable for a company as large and sophisticated as Hal Leonoard Publishing to have released such shoddy work.  They didn't even insure that all the songs are correctly arranged alphabetically in the book!  Having said all that, there are three things that Hal Leonard's new 6th edition has going for it: 1 - It's cheaper than the illegal version, which usually run about $35.00 each.  Amazon sells the concert key version for less than $20.00. 2 - The type is clearer and just a bit easier to read. 3 - Last but most importantly, the composers of these great tunes are actually getting paid, as they should be.  It can be argued that reason 3 (paying the composers) is more than enough reason to buy this version over the illegal version, and I have to agree with that, but be that as it may, it's still quite saddening that, after waiting all this time for a company to publish a legal version of this legendary text, they still couldn't do a competent job 
 never got this boo 
 The Kite Rider. A book centered completely on the importance of obedience. A small boy living in a small village of 13th century china has to overcome everything that is taught to him and above all from the importance of obedience to the importance of respect for your elders. Through being strapped to a kite and being used as a wind tester for a merchant vessel, Haoyou's father, Gou Pei, is brutally killed by first mate Di Chou, and that sets Haoyou's life in for a whirlwind of events he could not have imagined possible. After the horrific loss to Haoyou's family, Di Chou even tries so marry his mother -Qing An- an ambition he has long had. When Haoyou's greedy, gambling addicted uncle agrees immediately, Haoyou and his cousin Mipeng know they must do something. They send Di Chou (completely drunk) on a vessel, but to do that Haoyou bribes the seamen by being a wind tester. This brings The Great Miao, circus master of the Jade Circus looking for Haoyou to be one of his acts. Once again, Great Uncle Bo agrees for the money that he knows he can make out of it. Haoyou's kite riding act does well until the Jade Circus reaches the court of Kublai Khan, ruler of Cathay in 13th century china. There Bo challenges the Mongols to a kite ride, where the first person to come back to earth lost the bet. Haoyou wins, but he also happens to land in the Khans place of worship, a wagon full of grass and earth from the Mongolian steppes. This infuriates the Khan, and Haoyou is almost killed for his crime, had he not been offered as a secret weapon in the Khans moving army.  This novel was really not that great a book for me personally. It was just too short and lacking that factor that makes me want to read more of it. It was far too simple a plot too. Its like a ten page book with 250 pages of vague details scattered in between the words. This is the first book I have read by Geraldine McCaughrean, and it is not inspiring me to read the second.  
 This movie really stinks! I would not recommend it to anyone. Really stupid and short on plot. Not very interesting. Not even funny. Don't waste your money 
 Katzenbach demonstrates ameture descriptive ability combined w/ a poor plot.   I put it down 5 times before page 40.  "Wrong Man" left my gut wrenching w/ memories of the $25 I paid for it.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 China Mieville's first two novels set in the world of Bas-Lag gave him a well-deserved reputation as the most important young writer working in the sci fi/fantasy genres today. In Perdido Street Station and The Scar, Mieville created a neo-Dickensian milieu of bizarre, terrible, but deeply compelling grotequeries inhabited by complex, often-conflicted characters. Both narratives gained momentum over hundreds of pages, even as each sprawled further into and then away from the teeming city of New Crubozon, and  all of it was illuminated by Mieville's powerfully intelligent, pleasingly baroque prose style.  So, what happened with Iron Council? Mieville's third Bas-Lag book is confusing, meandering, and populated by shallow, underdeveloped, highly unlikeable characters. His writing style is choppy throughout and routinely defies the most basic rules of grammar and usage; perhaps he was aiming for profundity (think David Foster Wallace), but he achieved only preciousness at best, and tedium more often. The narrative-such as it was, given his penchant herein for flashbacks, deus ex machinas, and withheld information-had holes in it one could (pardon the pun) drive a train through. The plot progressed as if he didn't know where it was going when he was writing it. Above all, Iron Council was agonizingly dull-I could hardly wait for the book to be over with and finished.   Many have correctly noted that this is Mieville's most explicitly political novel. Since his politics are Euro-socialist in character, perhaps you might think I was put off by that-but no. I am myself that rara avis, an American social-democrat of long standing, and I have little but sympathy for tales of community-level collectives (a la the Paris Commune) or worker oppression (a la the transcontinental railroad)-and both themes and their thinly veiled historical antecedents are prominent in Iron Council. But largely because of Mieville's failure to draw fuller, more sympathetic characters (Cutter is a whiny jackass; Judah Low is a cipher) or to sustain a believable and interesting narrative (the Council itself is an irritating community prone to sudden, inexplicable shifts of opinion as to its raison d'etre-but never mind, as it doesn't finally appear until hundreds of pointless pages have passed following the interminable wanderings of Cutter & Co. and the similarly unlikeable Ori back in New Crobuzon), and with it all undermined by his annoying staccato voice and sometimes incoherent descriptions of events, whatever merits Mieville's radically politicized story may have had get thoroughly lost in the shuffle.  In his previous novels, nothing felt like a "set piece"; everything that happened usually played a crucial role in why subsequent events turned out as they did. In Iron Council, by contrast, one senses more a rote succession of staged novelty acts, as if Mieville were making use of every half-developed idea he'd ever had. (Take the attack of the "inchmen," for one instance.) In a similar vein, the major characters in his earlier Bas-Lag were sometimes morally ambiguous, but that just made them consistently interesting and complicated. As many have commented, the most noteworthy thing about two of the major characters in Iron Council is their homo- or bisexuality, and yet while this is a promising and perhaps vaguely daring premise in the usually hyper-heterosexual world of fantasy fiction, it seems a choice made more for shock effect than anything essential to them or the plot. Their sexuality is clearly intended to be-but is very poorly realized as-vital to these characters' "being-ness," and thus it contributes almost nothing to our understanding of them. In fact, Cutter's passionate possessiveness toward Low makes him seem, more than anything, one-dimensional and frequently grating-hence, Cutter's sexuality becomes more of a negative trait, which seems rather incongruous with Mieville's anti-intolerance politics.     SPOILER ALERT-Just a few plot objections concerning the end of the book (though there were plenty of others throughout): Why wouldn't the militia have destroyed or booby-trapped the tracks just outside of New Crobuzon? Why hadn't they sought out and found their cohorts and the Council in the weeks prior to the train's approach, just as Cutter had? Why can't any of the refugees from the city give the Council a reasonably straight answer as to whether or not the Collective had already been vanquished? (It had.) And most of all, how does the "time golem" manage to continue in existence even after Judah Low has been killed? Finally, and in a completely different vein, why does Mieville use the word "career" as a verb over and over again?   But enough already. I have never before had my expectations so shattered by an author. I am astounded that anyone would think that this book is on a par with-or even better than-Mieville's previous Bas-Lag novels (though the wider consensus seems to be one of disappointment, more or less). Unfortunately, though, Mieville received some of the best and widest mainsteam-media reviews of his career with Iron Council, and if he believes his clippings, I'm afraid we may in for more outings like this. But his earlier works provide a far better indication of his prodigious talents, and so  I will fervently hope that he can still return to that form with his next novel. 
 What a disappointment!  I remember Siskel and Ebert raving over this romantic comedy.  Romantic, maybe, but comedy - never.  Very predictable plot from beginning to end.  And Rosie Perez was truly offensive.  A few times I couldn't understand what she was saying.  There is no way I could buy that she and Cage's character were attracted to each other.  Maybe critics liked this movie because it had no sex, violence, or rough language.  Although Cage does get shot in one hold-up scene.  It was just that you knew what was going to happen every step of the way.  I am beginning to Like Cage more and more as he ages. [ spoiler] I was really disappointed at the end to find out that the real people whom this story is based on were always happily married to their original partners.  Either they shouldn't have changed it so much or they shouldn't have let us know about the real story it was based on.[end of spoiler]  But Fonda and Cage were very engaging together 
 The book was not at all what I expected. I usually don't buy this type of book but the web page and a story in a magazine intrigued me.       I was very disappointed in it as it was just a rehash of the usual "oh dear I am getting old - now what?" interviews and comments.   
 Mainly a series of names and dates.   Difficult to get through - not an interesting writing style 
 One good song on the entire album - South side with Gwen Stefani.  Rest of the songs have some sort of rap guy and not much if any Moby.  Waste of mone 
 they used the same formula for this disc as the did on their 2nd album but the material on here just downright SUCKS while i enjoy "sing a mean tune kid" and most of the "travel suite" tracks but as far as the other material goes it is just not good at all they reall blew it with this one sorry guys but i will give them credit for tryin 
 I'm sorry - I absolutely loved "Instance" and was hoping for something of comparable caliber. Instead I found myself dreading the time I would waste slogging through it. Sort of the way I felt about Michael Chabon's "The Final Solution" when half-way through I realized that that's all there is and what a shame to waste the energy writing even a novella on so flimsy a framwork.  Lewis Libby's "The Apprentice" is a better rendition of the "slender little mystery elevated towards art" genre which isn't really saying all that much.  Spend your time reading "An Instance of the Fingerpost" twice. 
 Im a big Halloween movies fan....while i thought this one would good and unique, it was anything but that.  First of all, its very dissapointing to see that the continuation of H2O was simply Michael Myers not actually dying, rather fleeing away through some bushes dressed as a paramedic.  And then Jamie Lee Curtis being eliminated without a follow up at the beginning of the movie paves the way for what is one of the worst horror films ive seen lately.  The concept of having some people in Michael's house is not terribly bad, but the fact that they made it so to today's standards of "horror films" just discredited the whole movie. So many characters with pointless roles, this whole rapper celebrity trying to fist fight Michael Myers, its just too many elements that don't help.  I don't recommend it at all. If you are a Halloween fan, you will be highly dissapointed by this one 
 I have read many writers guide books but this one is by far one of the worst. I have quite a few reasons why I feel this way but the main reason is that the style of teaching in this book seems to be a "MY WAY IS THE ONLY RIGHT WAY" kind of teaching. If you learn that way then go for it, I on the other hand like options and the book gives you the feeling that is isn't teaching you so much as demanding you to do it a specific way, the Authors' way, and only that way or you will fail! It implies that other ways will not work. Lots of the advice in this book contradicts advice that I've seen in several other how-to write books. The authors mistakenly believe because they have been published that the only way to get published is by doing EXACTLY what they did. I also found several examples where the authors say this or that will not work, yet I've seen the exact things they say NOT to do in alot of published books. There is a small bit of useful information but its of the kind that can be found in almost every romance writing book I've read. I honestly felt as though I wasted both money and time by buying and reading this book. If there was a negative rating I'd give it less than 0! If you want to learn how to write a romance I highly recommend "THE ROMANCE WRITERS HANDBOOK" by REBECCA VINYARD. It covers all the extra advice of this book and it also teaches you in a less dictative way. 
 If you purchase this lens adapter for the Xacti HD1A, you will not be able to take still photos using the built in flash. The adapter blocks the flash and causes black shadows in the bottom half of your photos 
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 I just read this series because I had picked up "The Harrowing of Gwynnedd" in a second-hand store and really enjoyed it.  Boy, is it obvious that this was written by a much younger writer.  The plot is  interesting, the action fast-paced, but the writing is pretty awful.  Let's  face it, having the villain stand on a hill and shake his fist at the  escaping hero is so cliched as to be embarrassing.  Read it only to fill in  the background for the other books 
 I found this book extremely generalized and narrow minded.I agree that the fact that eating disorders among minority women should be exposed and written about in order to give those women a voice and a place to turn to for answers.  However, the fact remains that the vast majority of eating disorders are suffered by white, middle class young women. Instead of addressing this, calls those who suffer from eating disorders and happen to be white and middle class vain. However when minorities suffer, the disorder is socio-economically created. She also draws generalized conclusions from a study of only 32 women. I feel the book was grossly over-generalized. The only part of the book that I felt was useful, was the fact that it brings the issue of minority eating disorders to the public's attention 
 Intonation good. Drugs bad. Nothing a piano tuner, an outside producer & a couple of days to clean up couldn't fix. I was gonna write "for hardcores only", but I'm a hardcore 'Blood fan & this pretty much just made me sad. Can't blame Gaylord Birch though, who's skin-tight throughout 
 Long before he flung open the closet door back in 1992 and declared his homosexuality, David Geffen made news. Big news. Really big news. His is the life --- from college drop-out to mailroom clerk to founder of record labels and a movie company --- that makes a biography such as the one Tom King has written so lengthy ... and often lumbering. King had access to Geffen and hundreds of people in and outside of Geffen's circle of power. This is Superman as Supermogul: Saving pal Calvin Klein from bankruptcy (it was Geffen's idea to out Marky Mark in that series of memorable underwear ads), paying for experimental surgery for dying pal Dawn Steel, wooing (and almost marrying) galpals Cher (whom King says was Geffen's "first fully-functional heterosexual relationship") and Marlo Thomas to finally settling boy with assorted boytoys, unselfishly donating some of his $3 billion to fight AIDS. So many details, so little substance. This is a meticulously researched, though ultimately superficial, look at the bravo and bullying, the temper and talent that have made David Geffen the builder, buyer and seller of the New Hollywood 
 A bit disappointing...  I guess I expected more, because I was told when I purchased this book that it was the best of the IN THE GARDEN trilogy. And that stands to reason when you expect the last to be the best.  After all, isn't that when it's supposed to all come together? Not to mention that I did enjoy Black Rose-5-star and thought Blue Dahlia 3-star was an average read.  Several of the novels with the NR seal have been about the supernatural and I have enjoyed most of those books.  Plus, when you see the NR seal, it's almost a given to be a good read. And you'll note I emphasized "almost", because, obviously, you can please some of the people some of the time, but not all the people all the time. And so it was with Red Lily.  The ending to this trilogy was a disappointment for me, especially after the first two novels. Hayley's character lost something in this book. Maybe I was just expecting her to mature. She didn't. Therefore, I have a hard time understanding how a guy like Harper could get hung up on such a childish person. And Roz, a very strong woman, just fizzed out. Grant it, the plot wasn't, and wasn't supposed to be, centered on her.  Regardless, she just wasn't the same as I'd expected. Overall, it was mostly the plot that didn't turn me on.  This one was just a bit too far-fetched. And to be quite honest, the ending just fell flat. Oh well, two out of three ain't bad. ;-)  
 I do realize that Grove's intent is to show us the basics and let us develop our own programs over time, but he leaves way too much food for thought.   The vagueness of the program, applies to it's incorporation into other sports, as well as powerlifting itself. For example, he tells us the deadlift and squat should be performed every 5-10 days and the chest twice a week, every 3-5 days, with one light day. What he doesn't tell us, is should we do the chest and deadlift on the same day since the muscles are different? And what does he mean by doing a "light" day for chest, when there is no explaination of this at all in the program? Are we just supposed to figure out our own system?   I also find it strange that Groves only gives 2 examples of other sports, where powerlifting can be used. One of which is basketball. You'd think he'd include a program for wrestling or Olympic weight lifting, but he didn't. Not only that, the exercises he lists, give no indication of how many sets, reps, or how his main program should be incorporated into that sport. He also tells you to a whole bunch of exercises, that aren't even listed in his book.  All I can say is, don't expect to follow this program properly unless you already have a good amount of knowledge of basic bodybuilding and it's exercises. 
 a HORRIBLE GUIDE!  I am an arborist and use field guides all of the time.  This is the WORST guide I have ever tried to use.  There is little or no organization in the way each tree is described.  Sometimes a tree's height is given in the opening description, other times you have to search for it in the body of the entry.  Sometimes a flower is described, other times no description appears at all.  Each feature that may define a tree is thrown in, in a slapdash manner, or left out, completely.  It's as if the authors knew that NG was paying them big bucks for a guide, and they simply threw it together as fast as they could to get their paychecks.  Forget ever trying to read this guide if you don't have your degree in the sciences, as I do.  The terminology is straight out of Botany 101/102, and you'll use the glossary to make it through each and every tree description.  FWIW, the measurements are given using the metric system. I guess it's a guide for Canadians, so if you're in the US and haven't been raised with metric measurements, you'll be frustrated on this count, as well.  The tiny symbol key that lets you know which symbol stands for each type of area a given tree may be found in is almost impossible to make out.  If you have a magnifying lense, you'll be OK.  Again, if you like great illustrations of trees and their constituent parts, this guide may be for you.  If you want a good guide that helps you identify trees easily--PASS THIS ONE BY 
 I have not written the exam yet. Before deciding on which books to use, I read the reviews, and then checked them for validity.  I have:-  -Sybex 70-291 (was given it) -MS Press 70-291 -Sybex Mastering Windows Server 2003 (Mark Minasi) -Exam Cram 2 (so as not to get caught out by silly MS tricks!)  This Sybex 70-291 is horribly lacking. 40 pages on RRAS and 40 pages on DNS. Are they for real????  You need to spend a load of time on studies for this exam... working your way through every aspect and click of this server before thinking of paying your exam fee cash. Understanding what you're doing is key to not looking like a plumb when the boss says, "Hey, set us up a secure VPN quick, Jack!"  There's no reason to fail it at all, so don't buy crap books like this one to assist in the failure stats. You have made it this far, so you have the ability to get this down, don't punish yourself by wasting time on something that is filled with verbose gibberish and repetition to fill up white space just so James Chellis and his merry bandits can sell a book. Cover to cover, it's 500 pages of waffle, but regurgitated and put through the machine backwards.  ...whilst Mark Minasi's book is 1750 odd pages of "Forget what you've been told by Granny Sybex's late great grandpa, This is how it really works!"  Your choice though.. 
 Let's be honest. This product ain't cheap. It's not something you can just throw away if it decides to stop working.  I bought mine at cpenusa.com. Delivery was great, only took them a couple of days. However, my c-pen cable was damaged. The connector to the c-pen was, for some reason, cut in half. Without it, you can't recharge or connect the c-pen to the pc. I called their main office all the way in Sweden during the office hours. NO RESPONSE. I sent three e-mails to cpenusa. NO RESPONSE. I don't care if the product itself is great(I'll never know now, will I..). If you're unable to receive support when you need 'em, you're screwed.  If you're just interested in electronic equipments, just want to try things out and don't really care if you're on your own, go ahead and try it. Let me know how this thing really is. Otherwise, buy a product that you can trust on with respect to after-sales support 
 JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around 
 This is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published. The fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man/woman and the development of societies is indeed sad. McElvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering. His imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy. I guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self-loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership. That's what happened here. Don't waste your time. A disturbing aspect to this is that he's teaching the next generation of leaders 
 This was my first Ruth Rendell novel.  I picked it up after seeing her name appear with very high praise on a list of top psychological thriller reads.  Based on this novel, I'd call her more of a literary fiction mystery writer.  The action doesn't really pick up until the half-way point in the book, but then steadily increases to the strong ending.  I rated the book so low because I thought too much of the book (likely half) was superfluous narration to fill in the main characters's history.  I think I could have understood the position of both main characters without so much detail.  If it hadn't been for the list of thrillers to read, I might not have finished the book.  It began without a "hook", prompting me to read on, but I kept thinking that there must be more if she is such a prominent author.  Some day I might try another Rendell/Vine novel, but I'd make sure it came with plenty of hot reviews and a quicker pace 
 This workbook contents only the anwers for the questions inside the Manual. The questions are just text interpretation and don't represent nothing than a method of study. I don't think that it is useful for people that want to understand the markets and need case studies 
 This book will make the author quite a bit of money.  He has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink.   Do you need to firm your butt, there's an exercise. Need to make a cheesecake for 12, there's a recipe. If you're a vegetarian, heed the memory prescription and be sure to get essential amino acids.  And did you know, the biggest problem with drinking 8 glasses of water a day is that "it is such a bore to pour."  The bottom line is: This is a big waste of money!  Its only therepeutic value is that it is written so poorly, the aggravation alone will keep your memory sharp 
 This book is a very general view from a very British perspective.  I don't think it belongs in Embry-Riddle's graduate programs because it does not meet the needs of experienced professionals.  As an undergraduate overview of the systems design process, it is good.  However, the author does not even touch helicopters, seaplanes, or lighter-than-air-technology.  So, the book would be more aptly named "Introduction to Airplane Design."  Some of his information on armament systems is grossly inaccurate.  Furthermore, the systems design process section does not reflect the current state of the art in the discipline of Systems Engineering.  I expect improvement in the next edition and hope the author makes more of an effort to talk to engineers on the other side of the pond 
 The Fall of Eagles is brillantly written and performed.  Keeping very honest with the historical record, it brings our heritage to everyone's doorstep.  Charles Kay and Gayle Hunnicutt, take us to Russian court of protocol and apathy.  Their performances make are poignant and truly believable of a fairytale gone wrong.  Patrick Steward is Lenin in all his veracity and passion.    Every child learning history, should see all 10 hours and 50 mesmerizing minutes 
 I bought this lid to use with my 8-inch saute pan (part of the 9-piece Calphalon commercial hard-anodized cookware set), but its slightly too big.  I would like to point out that if you go to the Calphalon web site, this is the lid listed as fitting the 8-inch saute pan.    The lid is usable, but doesn't seat well to get any sort of seal on the pan.  It's unfortunate, as its an attractive, well made lid, but for my purposes its useless so I am sending it back.  I also have the 10-inch stainless steel lid, which fits the 10-inch saute pan perfectly.  I'm not sure why Calphalon didn't take more care designing this one 
 This book's premise is great, and I thoroughly enjoyed the first 75 pages.  We meet the two main characters and learn interesting things about their lives.  Arlette is the 'book doctor,' and the query letters that are interspersed with the action are very entertaining.  I loved reading about this side of publishing...  Then I hit the wall.  Too much discussion in the text about feelings, nothing more than feelings...I started skimming.  The dialogue started disappearing.  The query letters sent to Arlette all started sounding the same, as though the author had lost her ability to change voice.  I gave up at page 130, regretfully.  I stopped caring about the characters, but I wanted to like the book more and couldn't 
 I bought this book hoping to see some good examples of IEP goals that I could revise in order to put them in the IEPs I write for students with specific learning disabilities.  I found this book not helpful at all.  I wouldn't recommend it 
 Delores Cannon certainly gives us an interesting view into the lives of the Essenes.  Built on the assumption of reincarnation and the possibility of past life regression, she attempts to show much detail of the times and peoples that were the Essene community, and ultimately, the life of Christ.  While it certainly is interesting reading, it is completely devoid of corroborating evidence.  She tends to agree or disagree with Archaeologists (never saying who her sources are), depending on whether they agree with her research.  Also, she supports the validity of her story as being more authentic than the Biblical account, as she claims to have an older source, a teacher named Suddi from the Essene community.  Some problems include the fact that while she claims the Biblical record has been changed, she seems to forget that the Dead Sea Scrolls from Qumran actually show the accuracy of the Biblical record, by moving the Old Testament back 1100 years, and yet with no significant changes.  It seems that her purpose is to promote her own view of reality, than to deal with any real historical evidence.  While it's an interesting story, I have to deeply question that there's anything resembling true research or evidence in this book 
 If you liked the original theatrical release (which was the first version of the film that made it to DvD) and own it, more than like you have all you'll need from KoH. I REALLY enjoyed the theatrical release, purchased it...and then later bought this version of the film based on many of its Amazon reviews. While it does add a great deal of watching time to the film, the extra footage really does little to improve the quality of the story or increase the depth of the characters to any "interesting" degree. Add to that, that this version of the film doesnt include the great documentaries(History Channel) found on the original DvD release. As I have shared, I REALLY enjoyed Kingdom of Heaven.....but didnt/havent found the purchase of this version to be an improvement over the original in the least. More doesnt always equal better.... 
 The picture quality is worse than that of the reruns on TV [Analog Cable, "Low" definition]. The fact that the show is from the 90's isn't an excuse - I've bought DVDs of show from the 60's [some of them "colorized" B&W], and they look much better. I agree with all the criticisms about the theme - even if they couldn't get the rights to the original theme, they still could have found something much better. Hopefully when they release the other seasons they'll do a much better job 
 This album is perfectly titled because he is probably the only one who is feeling it. Besides this album cover resembling Don Cartegena(his best album!) and the title ripped from an old De La Soul classic, Fat Joe doesnt give you anything you spectacular. No its not worser than All Or nothing but its still bad. He does have some dope tracks which are DAMN(all his songs should sound like this so why dont they?) NO DRAMA(sick beat, mediocre lyrics), BENDICION MAMI(great tribute to his mom), THINK ABOUT IT  HARD NOT TO KILL and STORY TO TELL but his album is weighed down heavily by these rusty anchors. Filler: Make It Rain and She's My Momma and Jealousy is bubblegum rap at its worst and Im still tring to figure out how Make It Rain became an anthem out here in South Florida. The song is bootycrack plus that has to be the worst beat Scott Storch has made! Pendemic needs to be redone. The Profit is better than Make It Rain but is that saying much? Breathe And Stop, which poorly samples Bob Marley's War is so dull I had to punch my self in the balls just to stay awake! And isnt that the dullest hook you've ever heard provided by The Game? Bottom Line: While this album is not worser than his previous work it is still forgettable like his previous albums. Joe raps decent on certain tracks and some of the beats are tight. You dont get the full package with Joe on this one and that why it will fall on deaf ears(all the pop albums he made notwithstanding). Fat Joe at his best: Jealous Ones Envy and Don Cartegena. Fat Joe at his worst: All Or Nothing, J.O.S.E., Represent(back when he was called Fat Joe De Gangsta),Loyalty and Me Myself and I. Thats five bad albums that Joe has made throughout his career. I think its about time for Fat Joe to hang it up. 
  I have read and reviewed many children's books in my 28 years as an elementary school librarian, and have found none with more glaringly inaccurate and unclear writing:Washington is the Evergreen State, not the "CHINOOK State", Mt.St. Helens did not have "LAVA" flows as the text says it did, the section about the state says that the Chinook winds are a "PAIR of winds" and does not explain what they are, they are warm winds that sometimes flow from east to west bringing warm air west. As a native of Washington, I began, and ended, reading in the section on our state. After reading the section I did not bother to check to see if the other states information was as inaccurate and poorly written, as I knew that I certainly would not want this book in any library nor in the hands of any children, dispite the vissual appeal.                                                         
 To secularist in every shape, form, and fashion...Spinoza is a saint, but to the Sefardim, a people that I belong to, he is a traitor.( I named my Labrador retriever after him) Philosophically speaking, to deny his cleverness in speech and thought would be wrong. Yet, Baruch Espinoza belonged/s to a people that continues to fight for their Spiritual identity. Him being the son of a prominant converso ba'al Teshuba( returning Jew) in Amsterdam at the time, meant he had an indispensible responsibility to continue the religious flame of his Iberian predecessors. Which he convinently dropped and sold for notority and the pursuit of secular studies.      The Sefardim are people who historically speaking, do not oppose secular studies. This can be traced to pre-expulsion Spain with such luminaries as Moises Maimonides, who was a brilliant medival phislosopher, yet held to the religion of his forefathers with fortitude and zeal. As a matter of fact, this special aura is what distinguishes us Separditas to the rest of the Jewish nation. We hold worldly studies in high esteem, yet we are observant Jews through and through. Not Espinoza, he could have brought such greatness to Talmudic thought, and still continue with his worldly pursuits, but instead he shamed himself and his people by negating his responsibility and his clever mind.       Even though his cherem (ex-communication)has been recinded, we the true Iberian Sefardim hold him in the highest contempt for his betrayal. And in my house, Baruch Espinoza sleeps outside because of it.  With this said, Goldstein's potrayal of Spinoza is skewed and out of harmony with the prevelent thought of modern day intellectual Sefardim.(For a better treatise on this, read Jose Faur's In The Shadow of history Jews and Conversos at the Dawn of Modernity) Being a citizen of the modern world does not necessitate negating ones heritage or beliefs for the pursuit of intellectual insights. Let's be realistic, modernity brought us greater disparity. What was supposed to bring us a utopian world quickly became neferious and dangerous, history has shown us that much.

 This garbage is one of the most hypocritical bands i have ever heard in my life. if you only knew... conservitive [...] and ironically enough they never did anything in music before or after knapsack. they surfaced once but their courage was confused. the secrets in the sacrifice 
 Oh boy...where do I start...I have read the reviews (unfortunately after I read the book) and I'm leaning heavily towards the unpopular zero star option for this book. Since I'm not on Amazon for a majority contest, I can care less if this review provides me with more "not helpful" votes.  The feeling of anticipation I normally get when reading a good book of growing attraction between the protagonists was close to nil in this book. There was of course plenty between the Hero and his mistress, as beautiful and kind and graceful with "honor" <-----Yeah JB gave her plenty of honor) as she was, I found myself wishing She and Lucien got together.   Again I was thoroughly angered by the fact that the book was mostly from the Heroine's prospective for pages and chapters at a time and specks of the Hero's for paragraphs within the chapter.  I found it very difficult to like this Heroine. Like someone else pointed out, BOTH parties were forced into the unfortunate circumstance, what was the point of her behavior and refusal to be cordial towards the Hero after he asked her time and time again. What really was the point of her cutting off her nose to spite her face??????  The physical violence was another aspect of the entire book I felt was very poorly dealt with. The first time violence is displayed is NEVER the last, and for Ms Beverly to give the misconception that all turns out well is very disheartening. I cannot even fathom my mind around how "romance" can be amalgamated into the life of two people when one is the abuser and the other the victim?????  Now the historical inaccuracies, as other reviewers so accurately put it, on what planet would someone in the Regency Era have had more than a bath a day????? More often than not, people merely washed up as opposed to taking full baths.  This is major issue I had a problem with, the introducing the Wife to the mistress...****gasp***** not only that, they become the best of friends.... is this not complete madness!!!!!  This is the second book I have read in the series and I'm not going any further, in the first book there was incest/rape, now this where two step siblings get married/domestic violence???? I guess in this case Ms Beverly tries to carry out her fantasy and make a better justification for it....No more Beverly for me. 
 She obviously has little or no interest in the irritating blonde woman who keeps telling her no. Boring movie. Look! Koko knows when someone is taking her picture! So does my pet Chihuahua 
 I do not recommend this book. This textbook is difficult to follow, it is difficult to grasp new concepts from the book. This book is not detailed enough, it often does not show all the steps that are taken in an example problem; this makes it difficult to understand many of the problems, especially the more difficult ones. I would also suggest that if it is possible, take calculus III before you take statics.Calculus III gives a much better and more thorough explaintion of the basis of vector mechanics. If you want a book that lays a better mathmatical base for vectors and vector mechanics, try reading "Calculus, 5th ed." by James Stewart. This book is an excellent indroduction to statics and it explains in much clearer language the derivations for of many of the equations presented in vector mechanics. 
 The contempt the author has for writers and the contempt so many of the agents have for writers is the real theme of this book. If you want names and addresses, use the internet. If you want a book that can actually help you get published, read The Square Guide to Publishing Your Non-fiction Book by Rudy Shur 
        The book is called The Circuit. This book is about a boy named Francisco Jimenez who wants to be another person. He had a hard time in school because he almost knew no English. He couldn't understand her. He had 3 brothers and 1 sister and a mom and dad. The worst thing to him was getting deported.        In school he had a problem with 2 kids named Curtis and his friend. They were the bullies. Once Francisco had wore a sweater that belonged to Curtis. Of course he didn't know. He was lucky they didn't beat him up. Later they became friends.         His brother that was born after him had a rare disease, but he made it through. I think that people who would like this book are people who have boring lives. After every chapter he wanted you to put the book down. He didn't leave any suspense. I hated the book so much. 
 I've read a handful of his books and loved every one, except this one.  The characters are not as fleshed out as in his other novels and not one is really likeable.As always Greene is a great storyteller, or at least starts out here with a great tale but the plot simply ceased to interest me midway through the book.    I found this one nowhere near the greatness of "The Heart of the Matter" or "The End of the Affair".  If you haven"t yet, read those!! 
 I was very disappointed in both the layout and content of this Schaum's outline. Unlike most other Schaum's outlines that are well-written by authors who appear to know their subject matter, this one seems to be written by someone who does not understand what a student is looking for in an outline on computer networking and doesn't seem to know the subject matter that well either.   For example, the first chapter, entitled "Data Communications", launches into a discussion of communication theory including wave division multiplexing, time division multiplexing, bandwidths for various applications, and modulation techniques. This is going to be very confusing to the average computer science student who has probably picked up this book to learn about the architecture of computer networks and instead begins his or her studies by reading a poorly written chapter on senior-level electrical engineering communication theory topics. To top it all off, the illustrations don't even make sense. For example, on page 5 there is a figure labeled "Typical Wave Division Multiplexing System". This figure consists of nothing more than 4 computers and two multiplexing devices with no connections shown. I'm sure if I was told to install a multiplexing system and this is what I gave the client, I would surely either be fired or promoted to management. The entire book is like this.  Rather than take the typical approach and explain network architectures in the context of the seven layer OSI model or some derivative thereof, the author just launches into discussions of miscellaneous topics without tying them all together in some kind of structure. For example, the chapter on multiple access is just plain baffling. The author talks about the different applications that need multiple access, and never bothers to define the term. Then the author discusses the three constraints of multiple access implementations, one of which he just labels as variable "a" without every properly defining what "a" really means, just how to calculate it. All calculations and examples shown are very elementary and poorly explained. There is a very sparse use of figures also. After reading through the outline, I can only figure that this lack of detailed diagrams and rigorous exercises is due to the author's lack of knowledge on the subject and thus his inability to produce them.  I would say that this Schaum's outline is a complete waste of time. Don't bother yourself with it even if someone gives it to you for free - you'll only end up more confused. It's not that the subject matter is just poorly presented, it is often wrongly presented. If you are taking a class on computer networking, more than likely you have been assigned Tannenbaum's "Computer Networks". If so, it is a very good book, if not you might want to bite the bullet and consider buying this rather expensive but complete and essential book. Tannenbaum can be a bit theoretical, though. So you might also want to also purchase "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Featuring the Internet" by James Kurose. That book is more applied than Tannenbaum's and has many network programming labs in the Java programming language to help hammer home certain concepts. 
 This guy is far out.  His attempt to find purely philosophical solutions to problems in the human situation reminds me of the guy in the armchair who talked about building a flying saucer.  Although the abstract concepts left him where he was, he was possessed by the delusion that he was trailing Halley's comet.  Reichmann, too, seems preoccupied such that, in addressing epistemological questions he thinks he's resolved some problem in concrete reality.  You cannot reach ecumenical celebration of truth without compromising it because mankind is beset with sin.  Only Jesus Christ will change the hearts of men, not some philosophical argument distilled from philosophical concoctions 
 This film is a documentary, not a movie.  For those of you who admire European films with honest, casual nudity, this film may not be for you.  European films with honest, casual nudity usually are non-pornographic in content.  This film brings the anatomy down to a degrading level.  If you want to view this film, fine, but be prepared for some tears and nausea.  This film is not for the faint-hearted.  Though here in America we do need to let loose our prudishness when it comes to casual nudity, yet, to Europeans who tolerate young children being victims of sexual exploitation I ask, where are your child protection agents, your social workers, your law-enforcement agents, your religious leaders and, for crying out loud, the parents?  I admire Europe's easy-going ways when it comes to casual nudity, whether on the screen or on their beaches, but when you view this film, you might think that a lot has to be said for the way we protect our children in America against sexual exploitation.  I cannot think of a more vicious, sinister crime.  I believe the body has a soul, only these young lads were cheated out of a healthy outlook on the body, let alone a normal, healthy childhood.  My poor heart just cries out to them.  I practically saw the devil through that pornographer in question. I was going to rent "Angels, But Not Angels," but this film, and "Mandragora", were enough for me 
 I have purchased the Unofficial Guide to Wald Disney world once before when we were planning a trip- we didn't get to go, so I purchased the updated one just last month.  Along with my order, I decided to add the Unofficial Guide "with kids" because we have 3 small children.  I was very disapointed.  This could have been a great accompaniment to the regular Unofficial Guide. For starters, in both my situations, the Unoffical Guide was A+ on info, I loved it.  The "with kids" seemed to copy and paste bits from that book. But, the confusing part, is that they didn't copy and paste parts that I found to be most useful in the Unoffical Guide.  I am confused about why you would need this book- and it lacks some of his personal insight.  My guess is that he did not actually do Disney with children and it seems to show.  The upside is that "with kids" does give web sites for outside the world hotels that is missing from the Unofficial Guide.  I also did find a couple other tidbits like the section on packing and creating uniforms for your family.  There is a lot of info on parenting style that is not found in the regular Unofficial guide- but I am still not sure why it is in this one either. I was so excited to see his insight and sad to say he didn't have any. Bottom line IMO is to skip this book, but don't skip the regular Unofficial guide.  It is a 6 star book! 
 Razor works great but it's easier to open it and run water over it to clean because the cradle doesn't get all the hair out 
 I found this book to be offensive.  On page 2, the author acknowledges the language differences of the process (toilet training vs. toilet learning).  As a reader, I understood her position and was comfortable to progress onto further pages.  As I continued reading, I was content with the author's writing until I accessed Chapter 4, where she discusses the positions of experts and references some of their works.  On page 47, she references the controversial book of "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day," by Nathan Azrin, Ph.D. and Richard Foxx, Ph.D. and that their "program was devised not for speed, but to help the retarded learn this difficult skill."  I think the term "mentally challenged" or "developmentally challenged" would have been more appropriate.  In spite of my shock that someone would write a book and refer to those with special needs as "retarded", I continued on until I accessed Chapter 6, "How Can I Train My Child Under Special Circumstances?"  Under the section "Using Public Restrooms Alone", the author discusses what she considers "supervised" use of facilities.  She states that a parent can stand outside the door while the child uses the facilities alone.  She states that a parent can "ask an appropriate-looking man to take the boy into the restroom while you wait outside the door. (Same for situations with girls, Dad.)" and to "only let a child alone to one that is in shouting distance or in view."  In a world where pedophiles are lurking in such areas and seize those moments when a child is alone to harm them, I find that advice to be completely irresponsible.  At that point, I could no longer continue reading this book and take advice from someone who would make such irresponsible suggestions.  I would rather have my child in diapers for the rest of her life!  Over 275,000 copies sold -- I wonder how many of those were returned, as mine was 
 I don't understand how anyone who chose his dog over his wife and daughter can be extolle 
 I was disappointed with the book because it is not for the average cook.  Too many of the recipes have unusual ingredients, and they are not satisfactory for my needs.  I give the book a 2 rating, although I'm sure that more adventuresome cooks might find it excellent. 
 I just wonder if this would have been published without the author's being married to an author;  I find his stuff repetitively boring as well.  This is a simplistic story of an orphan wife who acts as though she can't stand her husband and seems to glory in anything she can do to upset him  Her friend in these endeavors is an obviously manic / depressive (sorry, term has been replace by bi-polar victim ) whose wealth seems to make her the star.  Their enemy is the EVIL (can't use that word either) Eagle Forum which is trying to close down the local store where the kids get their drug paraphanalia.  It seems that both ladies have problems (oops, not allowed any more by the political correctness police, I mean 'issues') with their male counterparts.  They act like they hate their husbands.  I'd recommend this to anyone who hates Religious people and loves to see kids getting in trouble with drugs.  A dog . .  
 Having read the previous book by this duo about biblical archeology I looked forward to a good and interesting read.  I was hugely disappointed.  There was nothing new in this book: it seemed to be a re-hash of some of the material in the earlier book.  It may well be interesting to those who have not read the first book, but for me it was very tempting to put it down.  (However, I did read it through to the end. 
 If it were possible, I would give a negative star rating for this book.  To sum it all up in one sentence, Carol (an extreme left-wing animal rights/environmentalist/Feminazi propagandist and a New Age crystal-squeezer to boot) actually claims that eating meat is equivalent and related to abusing women!  I can just see the eco-cops outside my kitchen window with guns drawn "SIR, PLEASE STEP AWAY FROM THE CHEESEBURGER!!".  Never once in her book does she consider the obvious fact that meat has always been a normal part of the human diet in the vast majority of cultures, and that maybe, just maybe, people (including women) eat meat simply because it tastes good.  But then it's typical for the more extreme feminists to be so out of touch with reality that they see nefarious male-oriented political motivations in even the most innocent of human behavior 
 There is a lot of buisness talk and a lot of action in this book, but it is just so far fetched that I could hardly read it.  First of all, I can't believe that Cy hated her so much just because she lied about her age?  Also, Meredith never stuck up for herself when she was being accoused of theft?  She just ups and runs away, pregnant and alone with nothing?  Also, the biggest part of this story that I could not believe was that Henry just meetS her and the next thing you know she is Head of an international company.  Just like that.  I found myself wishing that Meredith got together with Mr. Smith (Her sons babysitter/bodygaurd).  I was also looking forward to reading the scene where Cy realizes that Meredith's son was his and his own Mother was responsible for everything that has happened, but on his way to confront Meredith he gets in a car wreck and instead of her being angry at him for all he and his mother put her through, she is worried sick about him and is all sappy and forgiveable with him?  I would not reccommend this book unless you like stories that the woman never sticks up for herself and gets walked on even up to the end 
 Ok, I'm sorry to say I've given up on this book.  With so many good books in the world to read...I'm just not willing to waste any more time reading a bad one.  After 200 pages...there is still no plot.  Maybe I'm missing something and this is supposed to just be lots and lots of talk about a cold white landscape.  Oh wel 
 This is a sad attempt at modern science fiction.  I was appalled by the lack of continuity and the plotting errors.  Remainder Bin here I come 
 These are as pathetic an excuse for an item as I have ever seen. Let's begin: First, the magnets are about as big as an eraser from the top of a pencil, tiny in other words, and they come shipped just loose in a small plastic bag.   Okay, that would be fine if that was the only complaint. But, thgey just don't work well. For all the "high" power, I could only get a single magnet to hold 2 sheets of paper, not the 10 promised. Only way, one could hold 10 were if it were tissue paper.   These magnets are a joke and Amazon should be a little ashamed for offering them for sale. 
 The author writes in his Introduction "In this book the reader will find, I hope, an antidote for historical amnesia (xvi)."  To do so, Nash says that his book aims at "Disinterring these long-forgotten figures from history's cemeteries (xvii)," so the reader will encounter those figures the middle and lower ranks of American society ... [that] remain anonymous (xvii-xviii)."  But as much as it is touted as a "new" and "fresh" approach to the "untold" history of the American Revolution, I can only say that this is so much hype.    I was primed by Professor Nash's introductory claims to expect reading some new interpretation of well-known sources, or possibly some ground-breaking research into untapped primary source materials.  Instead, I quickly realized that while many of the narratives on eighteenth century America were interesting, there was little that was "new" or "innovative," except his assessment that his interpretation was somehow "radical."  In fact, I soon realized that I was familiar with most, if not all, of the people and events he described: so much for being "new."  A look at Nash's source citations will show he has actually done little or no actual "research."  Instead, he has produced an analysis of old narrative histories, many of which have been around for decades, as well as some more recently published secondary accounts.  Quotations, more often than not, are attributed to other historians, or if historical figures, are "quoted in" other secondary sources.  This is how good undergraduate research papers are constructed, but as a published work, it must be described as "analysis," and not a "contribution to the body of historical knowledge."  Furthermore, many of the older sources he quotes would otherwise be those of the sort he would criticize.    It reads as if it is written more for other academic historians, rather than to educate a reading public starving for historical narrative.  Nash injects "political correctness" into his analysis at the expense of really understanding the era.  For example, he never describe the Six Nations of Iroquois as an "Empire," as if only Europeans can be guilty of creating such polities; although they ceded Shawnee or Mingo land claimed by right of conquest to white settlers.  In another example, he implies that the captivity of white children and their adoption into Indian societies was somewhat kindly.  The murders of the rest of the captives' family or the sense of loss experienced by those surviving the raids are thus minimized.  That some of those who refused repatriation may have suffered from an eighteenth century version of "Stockholm Syndrome" is not explored; while those who escaped or accepted repatriation and related not so pleasant experiences in their captivity narratives are ignored or marginalized.  In Chapter 5, "The Dual Revolution," Nash indicates a lack of knowledge or understanding about the military history of the American War for Independence in general, and the war on the frontier in particular.  One clue is given in his description of the Wyoming Massacre of 1778, the "grisly story of Tory and Indian brutality," of which he concludes "Modern scholarship supports none of this (255)."  Yet, even the Tory commander Major John Butler's report, available in the Sir Frederick Haldimand Papers in the Canadian Archives and British Museum, recorded that the Tory rangers and their Indian allies "took 227 scalps and only five prisoners."     Overall, Nash's account just plainly gets a lot of it wrong!   
 The title and what seemed to be overwhelming praise captured my attention.  When the book arrived I was eager to read it.  I cracked the pages and my jaw dropped, not in a good way.  This book is so poorly written I am baffled  at how it ever got published in the first place.  I read as much as I could but the poor use of language and annoying blocks of italicized text made it impossible.  I returned to Amazon to look at the reviews, again.  This time, rather than just taking the star rating and "featured reviews" at face value, I really went through page by page and evaluated the reviews.  It appears that many, many kids have been assigned to write a review here at Amazon as part of a class project.    If you read through all of the reviews on this site you will see that most of them are written by children.  95% of the kids reviews have given the book a 5 star rating which has thrown off the rating.  If you pay attention to the reviews not written by children you will see that the majority of adults do not enjoy this book.  If you're between the ages of 11 and 13 you, apparently, will love this book.  If you are an adult, who knows better, don't expect much from it.  In my opinion, it is a waste of paper.  (On a side note:  A little time investigating the author brings into speculation the veracity of his story. 
 This book has a shocking, last minute twist a la Sixth Sense.  The surprise in the movie, Sixth Sense, however, works.  Your view of the story is suddenly turned on its head and you're left wanting to go back to look for the clues that you missed before.  In the case of this book, the twist was completely unbelievable and even felt a bit obscene.  To make it every more frustrating, I thought the book was  actually a good read, and I kept reading thinking the mystery's solution would be revealed and the intriguing  questions would somehow be tied up. Instead, the ending left me rolling my eyes and feeling duped rather than entertained. This Beach Road leads to nowhere 
 1. The Twelve Steps do not work as a program of recovery from drug or alcohol problems.  o The A.A. failure rate ranges from 95% to 100%. Sometimes, the A.A. success rate is actually less than zero, which means that A.A. indoctrination is positively harmful to people, and prevents recovery. Some tests have shown that even receiving no treatment at all for alcoholism is much better than receiving A.A. treatment:  o One of the most enthusiastic boosters of Alcoholics Anonymous, Professor George Vaillant of Harvard University, who is also a member of the Board of Trustees of Alcoholics Anonymous World Services, Inc. (AAWS), showed by his own 8 years of testing of A.A. that A.A. was worse than useless -- that it didn't help the alcoholics any more than no treatment at all, and it had the highest death rate of any treatment program tested -- a death rate that Professor Vaillant himself described as "appalling". While trying to prove that A.A. treatment works, Professor Vaillant actually proved that A.A. kills. After 8 years of A.A. treatment, the score with Dr. Vaillant's first 100 alcoholic patients was: 5 sober, 29 dead, and 66 still drinking.  (Nevertheless, Vaillant is still a Trustee of Alcoholics Anonymous, and he still wants to send all alcoholics to A.A. anyway, to "get an attitude change by confessing their sins to a high-status healer." That is cult religion, not a treatment program for alcoholism.)  o The A.A. dropout rate is terrible. Most people who come to A.A. looking for help in quitting drinking are appalled by the narrow-minded atmosphere of fundamentalist religion and faith-healing. The A.A. meeting room has a revolving door. The therapists, judges, and parole officers (many of whom are themselves hidden members of A.A. or N.A.) continually send new people to A.A., but those newcomers vote with their feet once they see what A.A. really is. Even A.A.'s own triennial surveys, conducted by the A.A. headquarters (the GSO), say that:   81% of the newcomers are gone within 30 days,   90% are gone in 3 months, and   95% are gone at the end of a year.  That automatically gives A.A. a failure rate of at least 95%. But the GSO does not count all of those people who only attend a few meetings before quitting -- they don't qualify as "members". (That amounts to "cherry-picking".) If we included them, then the numbers would be much worse.    First there is the propaganda technique of "everybody's doing it": "AA or a similar Twelve-Step program is an integral part of almost all successful recoveries".  That is a complete falsehood. The vast majority of the successful people recover without A.A. or any "support group". It's what "everybody" is doing.   Then they use the propaganda techniques of use of the passive voice and vague suggestions: "It is widely believed that not including a Twelve-Step program in a treatment plan can put a recovering addict on the road to relapse."  It is widely believed by whom? And what do those unnamed people know? What are their qualifications? Are they doctors? Medical school professors? Or salesmen for a 12-Step treatment center? Why should we care what some unnamed invisible fools allegedly believe, anyway?   The authors also use the propaganda technique of fear-mongering: you will be "on the road to relapse" -- you will probably die -- unless you practice Bill Wilson's Twelve Step cult religion.   And then the fluff-headed Pollyanna attitude is outrageous: Just going to the wonderful A.A. meetings is supposedly all that is needed to fix some alcoholics.  But since A.A. has a zero-percent success rate above and beyond the normal rate of spontaneous remission, that cannot possibly be true.   
 The "Gold's Gym Nutrition Bible", while comprehensive in its approach to bodybuilding nutrition, is nonetheless vague and outdated.  Most of the nutrition advice offered is basic, beginner-intermediate level, and very little scientific research is quoted to support its claims.  A good point of departure for anyone seeking an introduction to bodybuilding nutrition, but not detailed enough to make a useful compliment to training and diet.  Most of the information between the covers of GGNB can be found on the newly mandated food package nutrition labels -for FRE 
 I did not like this movie. I know that times have changed and it would be revisionist to hold this movie to millennium standards of sexual conduct and infidelity. Nonetheless, I found it very disturbing: his lack of concern for his wife and children, how the wife was unsympathetic and one dimensional, and how absolutely de rigueur it was in the sixties for married men to have "a bit on the side." And what about her kids? apart from the first scene we never see them again; she instead seems to spend all her time cooking and keeping house for a married man. I'm not a prude, really, but this film left a bad taste in my mouth 
 Although this book didn't really live up to expectations, I will at least say it provided an entertaining read.  If you're already familiar with contemporary sci-fi you won't find too many new ideas here.  A lot of the ground in this book has already been covered in works like "The Diamond Age" (Neal Stephenson - nanotech opus), "Neuromancer" (William Gibson - disembodied ID shifting), "Ender's Game" (Orson Scott Card - automated education) or "The Transmigration of Timothy Archer" (Phillip K. Dick - tricked out humans).  Of course the main difference here is that Mr. Kurzweil is not a sci-fi author but a proven inventor and entrepeneur.  He acknowledges the 'speculative non-fiction' aspects of the book but at times gets carried away with his predictions and occasionally sounds like a hokey traveling salesman.  Throughout the book he claims some degree of expertise in such broad ranging interests as nanotechnology, neurology, interactive entertainment, visual arts, biology, anthropology, philosophy, ethics and sexuality.  Granted the material draws on many of these disciplines but his arguments often come to conclusions that simply have no scientific basis.  This book, published in 1999 suggested that our brains will be "scanned" in the near future.  The concept sounds very Ghost-In-The-Shell and has about as much plausibility as a typical Japanese animation.  An article appearing in the October 2004 issue of Discover asked the question, "Will anyone ever decode the human brain"? The author, much less optimistic than Kurweil noted that "No conceivable technology will be subtle enough to discern all the memories, emotions, and meanings aroused in us by our perceptions."  He made this assumption based on the fleeting nature of the actual neurons in your brain that change and evolve rapidly every day.  To equate this mush with bits and bytes, jpegs and mp3's, is a little naive and ridiculously optimistic.  Hopefully it will happen someday, maybe even in our lifetime.  Until then though, you'd be better off reading real fiction...  This book's (almost) saving grace is Kurzweil himself.  He's obviously having fun writing this book and presumably hopes to raise some eyebrows.  Even when that comes off as legacy-building ("Remember - you read that here first!") it's oddly charming.  Inserting himself into a dialogue with his fictitious creation "Molly" is at first obnoxious, condescending even, but by the end it's actually pretty amusing.    That said, if you're holding out for some deep insight as to what a "spiritual machine" might be, I'll save you the trouble by telling you that the author's angle (in the two pages it's mentioned) is that spirituality basically boils down to biological phenomena.  Sorry, that it.  Apparently that was good enough for Mr. Data so it's also good enough Mr. Kurzweil.  Computers will one day magically start loving - once they're smart enough of course.  In the mean time, we can gloss over the fact that subjective AI is still a non entity in our world 
 I was hoping for something much more layman in explaining the great quantum physics. It is not an easy read. I have found other books that were more easy to read on the subject 
 This is the best coffee I've ever had.  Very smooth with rich flavor 
 Nothing new here.  Same ideas presented in a very uninteresting fashion.  This book neither motivated me, nor did it teach me a thing about fat loss.   Jim should read some of the other books that have been published since.  The "3 Hour-Diet" by Jorge Cruise and "Five Factor Fitness" by Harley Pasternak are significantly better 
 After enjoying his first book, Term Sheets and Valuations, I was looking forward to this one.  I regret to say that I found it a big waste of time and a bigger waste of money.    It appears as if the marketing of the book by the pblisher sought to take advantage of his first book by raising the price by 500%, giving the impression that this book was better or more comprehensive.  However, nothing could be further from the truth.  
 I'm really very surprised that anyone liked this book at all.  How could anyone who likes Salinger's writing stand reading Alexander's terrible prose?  It is really painful, and that's just the starting point.  As others on this page have mentioned, the author has little or no understanding of Salinger's work (the example of his misunderstanding the story "Teddy" is a particularly good example, but the book is strewn with them).  Worse, the author isn't just ignorant but actually hostile to Salinger.  It's hard to understand why someone would take the time to write a book about someone he clearly dislikes.  If you must read this book out of curiousity, get it at the library.  I felt really ripped off after buying this book, and wished I had not given a nickle to this creepy author.  And if you are NOT familiar with Salinger, by all means do not read this book.  Read Salinger.  Your own speculation about the guy based on his fiction will make more sense that this so-called biography 
 The summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of bad/flat, lifeless acting, a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough CGI to make your eyes bleed.  The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.  But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.  And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement 
 It's all very refreshing and feels enticingly rebellious to enter into Chomsky's world, but one must keep reminding oneself that 1) the material presented here can be approached from a wide spectrum of angles, and 2) righteous indignation has its place, but it also has a dangerously seductive drug-like appeal for egomaniacs and know-it-alls.  Criticism of Chomsky's factual errors usually seems to distort the truth itself, and it misses a bigger point.  We can accept that all Chomsky's facts are correct and still have a big problem with this book: his presentation and interpretation pours gas on a fire that's burning the structure of whole civilizations.  While emotional extremes are great for getting our blood pumping, the current polarized political environment would benefit from a more balanced and restrained perspective.  I understand the desire to energize people in reaction to the carefully-engineered apathy that paralyzed the left for so long, but surely the answer is to diminish the pendulum's wild swinging - not to push it to even greater extremes.  If you seek only to convince your natural allies you risk alienating potential allies and energizing them against you 
 San Disk C150. Stopped working in about 10 days(locks up after boot up screen), returned and received new one. Replacement stopped working in about 5 days. I am now going to replace it. And yes,I went through the SAn Disk support first,but they told me to return it. On a good note I was pretty impressed with the promptness of the phone surport 
 This is HORRIBLE. DON'T be tempted to read it because you're an Austen fan. This author is the example that proves true an essay, The Janeites, about how sometimes.. those who like Austen the most.. would be exactly the ones who disgusted Austen herself 
 When I was first forced to read this book, in high school, I detested it, and the following years I spit in the direction of anyone who even remotely praised it.  But, lately I've been going back to some of the books I read in high school that I loathed, Huck Finn being one that I absolutely love now, Twain was a genius, Fitzgerald, however, was not.  I can appreciate the attempt at trying to depict the "higher class" as emotionless demons bent on self satisfaction, totally void of any comprehension of other people, I can appreciate the story of Gatsby, a man determined, to such a degree as to build a massive house, filled with empty trinkets, and hold parties in the hopes that she'll attend, to win back what he thought was the love of his life, but what I can't appreciated, at all, is the book in general.  Fitzgerald was a good writer, that's it, just good, not great, and certainly not spectacular.  And for all the "deep" and "hidden" messages of the book that people seem so meaninglessly deperate to find, seriously, this is nothing more than a literary soap opera attempting to come off as artistic.  I've got Tender is the Night and This Side of Paradise, still checked out from the library, but I do believe one exposure to Fitzgerald's mediocre style is enough.  Hemingway dominates beyond belief over F. Scott 
 Oh my gaw! That other reviewer is right - I am just so, so jellllllus of Jessica and her marriage to Nick that watching these DVDs makes me want to tear my hair out and smother my husband of six years. I yearn for the life Jessie has of being: bleach-blonde, fake-tanned, married to someone whose eyes have surprisingly not fallen out of his sockets given the amount of times he rolls them at her, and whose creepy father constantly hovers around, making comments about her sex life and (...). Oh yes, jealous I am. I am soooooooo envious!  I think what I really wish I had is Jessie's intellect, ya know, that of a flea, because being stooooopid is hot, y'all. Being dumb and man-faced with (...) Oh and getting divorced after putting your marriage on the air for three years is just THE ULTIMATE cool. It's kind of like throwing out last year's fashions, you know. So if you're dying to live Jessie's life vicariously, this is the DVD for you. ENJOY 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 I have always been a prolific reader and rarely do I come across a book for which I can find no value, no redeeming qualities. But I must extend a hearty congratulations to Julia Barrett for writing the most astounding piece of horse excrement I have ever had the misfourtune to purchace. Teachiing my cat to walk repeatedly over my keyboard would produce a work of more sense. If you are like me and just have to read it - just because you're obsessed with Austen - Buy it used for 45 cents and then burn it 
 This Philips HTS3400 DVD has all the features I need, but its mp3 player is really bad: Audio just pops before moving to a next song . It looks like what Philips' people just do in all of their electronics.  I really don't want to talk about this any more because William R. French and  A. Isaicu all talke about these problems 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 Mr. Irving is a renowned writer who has pleased readers with books like, The World According to Garp, Prayer for Owen Meany and Cider House Rules.  There is a creativity about his writing and a quirkiness in his characters that I find appealing.  What happened here?  I was so mired down in wordiness and child sexual abuse that my commitment to the book ended with the protagonist's early grade school sexual experiences.  If somebody walked into a person's home and found drawings of what was verbalized in the book, they would probably consider the individual a pedophile and his home would be marked on public records as housing a pervert.  It seems strange that a brilliant writer could go on ad infinitum, describing the same things in words and be considered worthy of praise.  Anything the book had to offer was lost on me because I couldn't get past being inundated with pages and pages dedicated to pathetic images of a young boy's penis; crude and rude, abusive adolescent girls; and body hair fetish.  Maybe had I been pulled in enough to read further, I would have found redeeming value in Until I find You.  As it played out for me, the book is not worthy of John Irving.       
 BLACK CHRISTMAS is not as effective as HALLOWEEN. The killer is annoying, some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language to get his point across. The direction and editing is weak. How many times do we have to see the woman wrapped in cellophane up in the attic...she's dead ..I get it...Move on! I wasnt routing for the characters or the killer for that matter...this movie just didnt deliver. HALLOWEEN and WHEN A STRANGER CALLS "borrowed" from this film and both movies were scarier 
 After all the good reviews, I decided to give this one a chance.  Phew.  What can I say?  Laymon's characterizations are shallow as wallpaper, and the pace of the book is plodding in the extreme.  The author piles on detail after mundane detail, often taking several sentences just to move one of his characters across a room--which would be fine, if something actually happened along the way.  I also found his character's adolescent obsession with catching glimpses of women's bras and breasts embarrassing (for him, not for me).  I agree with others here who have said that these kids seem more like 12 than 16.  I persevered to the end, though, just to see where it was all going.  Wish I could say it was worth the effort 
 This is not for those hoping for more that a romance that uses the sinking of the Titanic as its backdrop.  It is poorly acted, full of campy gestures, lines and effects.  Buy "A night to remember" directed by Roy Ward Baker. It is so excellent. It has the personal stories but delivers them more effectively and with none of that overacting that typifies so many films produced to showcase an actor or two. 
 Alissa Quart's book takes a particular position which it advances relentless and articulately: Identifying and providing targeted services for gifted children is a form of harm which deprives them of childhood, freedom and a chance to develop without becoming parental "projects."  As a prodigy herself, she felt harmed by being identified as gifted; ergo it is bad for all gifted children.   She makes as good a case as I've read, but I doubt that any single solution works for all children. As one of the people she interviewed in the book as having expertise in this area, I see some of the children she describes but I also see the children who are floundering without accommodation. What about the 5-year-old considered "too immature" to be advanced from first grade into second, but her immaturity disappears when she is actually given books at her actual reading level? Would anyone have given her the 4th grade books in class if someone with and alphabet after her name and objective test results hadn't documented it? How many times would she have read "Pat the Bunny" before getting a little punchy?  There is a reason that gifted is mentioned under the section on Attention Deficit Disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR). It reminds all of us in the mental health business that we need to make certain that we aren't labeling and medication children who are simply academically underchallenged. Crushing boredom isn't therapeutic and children don't respond well to it. Bored kids entertain themselves in ways that are sometimes disruptive, thoughtless and annoying. Some of these kids aren't relishing the lack of academic pressure; they are being given prescriptions for Ritalin. Miraca Gross' research on gifted is solid, lovely work - and it supports academic acceleration as generally benign and often transformative for bright, underchallenged children.    In the three hours of telephone conversation, Alissa and I ranged pretty widely. It was sad that she highlighted the exchanges which were the most unkind to parents of gifted children. While there are parents who can be overly invested in their children, most of the parents of gifted children that I have met are not. Many of these parents are slow to embrace the label and worry that they will raise a generation of pint-sized narcissists. Every group has its fringe: a bit entertaining, a bit bizarre and not representative of the community. While they make good anecdotes, they do not make good ambassadors.   I chose to do work with gifted children and their parents because there is a need. The people hovering on either end of the bell curve tend to have a rougher time of it. Few would argue that providing services to children with mental retardation is somehow an expression of parental narcissism, but apparently children who are equally statistically unusual are going to be happier if they are shoehorned into someone else's idea of normality. I'd rather we support them in discovering their own abilities and difficulties while supporting their parents with the shockingly hard job of parenting 
 The problem with this fountain is that the sound of the water pump is much louder than the actual trickling sound of the water.  The orange light is a little annoying too.  The fountain is made of cheap brown plastic -- so don't think you are adding much class to the decor of your home.  All in all, it does not provide a very relaxing environment.  
 well... the first day i got it i popped in the battires and really thought it was good. i dry-shot it a few times and showed off to my dad because he got me a horrible spring pistol for christmas.i charged it for a couple of hour and put some bbs in and shot some. its the slowest shooting gun ive ever seen! it wouldnt hurt even at point blank! but i kinda recomend it for 4 year old backyard games. 1.5 out of 5 
 As someone who lived through and participated in the events Michener described I was deeply upset by his book which I feel is nothing less than a falsification of history. Clearly Michener, who was on friendly terms  with Nixon and his crowd, had a hidden agenda in trying to discredit  radical student activism and the movement against the War in Vietnam, a war  which Michener supported.  Anyone interested in getting both sides of this  story should read I.F. Stone's book, "How Murder Went Unpunished at  Kent State."  Stone's view is diametrically opposed to that of  Michener whom he denounced in person as a shameless propagandist for the  Nixon Administration on NBC's Today Show in 197 
 These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though 
 This book is not an introduction to DirectX, D3D, or C#. It is a very high-level introduction to game engine design. One could almost gain as much from saying "Compartmentalise your objects" several times a day.  The title implies that it will give you some help understanding how DirextX and C# work together to create a game engine. This is false. There is a lot of uncommented code in this book (half the first chapter of 26 pages is uncommented code). The explanations given are abstract to the point of being worthless to someone who truly needs an introduction, giving only light glances at the example code. It is impossible to get a clear picture of everything involved.  There are doubtless those for whom this book is the perfect level of abstract discussion. However, I believe this is the exception rather than the rule. Highly not recommended 
 It seems to be a thinly veiled attempt to capitalize on the success of the Da Vinci Code. And just in case you missed it, there are several references too! The plot is wafer thin....who on earth would expend money and effort to simply chase a 4000-year old dream? All situations seemed to be too easily contrived and coincidental. Traps built several thousand years ago continue to work with the efficiency of a Swiss watch. Reilly thinks he's writing to a bunch of school kids.....exclamations, sound effects and hyphenated actions abound! Too obviously, the protagonists (Lily and West) have genius-level IQs and crack codes like you and I would crack our knuckles. The heroes have unfettered access to almost everything. Save yourself money and time .... stay away from this book 
 This film was fairly interesting in parts, but the plot didn't make any sense.  Brenda Marshall plays an interesting person- a woman scientist- which was rare in the 1940's.  However, the film loses credibility when she has an accident and is disfigured.  She has plastic surgery and changes identities. However, she looks the same as she did before, but  no one seems to recognize her.  That particular item spoiled the movie for me.  Ruth Ford plays a tough blackmailer and Hillary Brooke portrays a really bad lady.  William Gargan is very ineffective as Brenda Marshall's love interest.  His usual vibrant personality is really subdued here.  Anthony Mann is the director and he does a credible job, but the writing is amateurish and the whole production looks very shoddy. The print itself is pretty good and there is a certain film noir feeling to it.  I liked the fact that Brenda Marshall played an intelligent scientist and that the women had very strong roles, but the overall impression that I went away with was disappointmen 
 While this book may provide decent preliminary overview for someone who knows nothing about Native American literature, it lacks any original incite and critical depth. One of it's crucial claims states that one should "Read Native American Literature open to the possibility that you might find yourself rethinking your view of the world" (29). I could have gotten the same message from a fortune cookie.  This is definitely not literary criticism. Coming from someone who has spent significant graduate research on Native American literature, I recommend that you do not waste your time reading this so-called "critical work. 
 This book seems to have been written by Jeffrey Deaver just prior to his full acquisition of the unique style, creativity, pace and humor that marked his later works.  The Lincoln Rhyme novels, for example.  All of them employ Jeffrey's formidable writing skills, and are tremendously entertaining on many levels.  Mistress of Justice falls short of these expectations, however.  I got only halfway through it, skimmed the rest, then went right to the ending - which was predictable.  Never thought I'd do that with one of Jeffrey's books, and I have read nearly all of them.  The problems with this book are many.  The pace is very slow.  The plot - not very strong.  Too many characters are introduced, too quickly.  Too much writing space devoted to non-essential details.  But there also seems to be a snooty, snobbish tone to the entire book - almost as if Jeffrey had written it to impress his cronies in the lawyering arena of NYC.  While I was reading - I failed to find anyone in the story to admire, to cheer for, and more importantly, to identify with.  Although some may be fascinated by that particular class-based New York / New England culture of old money, politics and snobbishness, I am not.  Yet Jeffrey revelled in laying this all out in a manner that suggested the reader should love and embrace this culture.  Fortunately, Jeffrey moved away from this style in his later novels - all of which are marked by rich characters, from life's many diverse walkways.  Mistress of Justice reinforced my belief that you cannot hit a home run every time up - and that's fine.  And, I am grateful that the mistakes made in this novel are not found in any of Jeffrey's later works.  If you are as big a Jeffrey Deaver fan as I am - and you have not yet read Mistress of Justice - steel yourself for possible disappointment 
   "Andrew Carnegie: and the Rise of Big Business" was the worst book I have ever read.  I went into reading it with an open mind, and after the first chapter I wanted to pull my hair out it was so boring.     First off, the book took place in a time period where I wasn't even born.  My parents weren't even born yet.  It has to do with a subject that I don't even know about.       Second, the author dragged on and on about numbers and business partners and business investments.  He was using words that were not in my vocabulary.     Finally, the plot and main ideas of the book were so slow.  They jumped around and I didn't know what business we were talking about, or which business partner was involved.  They talked about money and finances.    
 If I could give this book Negative three stars, I would.  I found it to be pretentious and not at all helpful in planning.  For instance it says that a bride that has a precious moments cake topper is probably too yound to be  married.  Also, they give a thumbs down to fountains in wedding cakes.   Instead of helping you plan a wedding in your taste, they are inflicting  their STRONG opinions on the bride-to-be.  This is the only book I have  ever returned in my life. It doesn't answer any of the questions brides  have, like what order veryone walks in the processional or any suggestions  for music or flowers.  Don't waste your money on this book if you need a  wedding planner 
 Another reviewer wrote that this album is great "massage music" and is therefore compatible with a state of relaxation.  And I sadly have to agree! If you're looking for energetic and rousing battle songs that testify to the courage of the ancient Scots, you're definitely NOT going to find it here.  These songs are utterly lacking in energy and inspiration.  It seems the New Age movement has emasculated even our proudest memories of ancient courage and valor.  This album is an insult to the memory of the brave kinsmen who struggled against many worthy adversaries to achieve dignity and freedom.  The lyrics reflect little more than self pity, and the music could not stand alone without the vocals as most of the "songs" do not even have a strong melody by themselves.  I was expecting some rousing music such as that found in the old tune called "Men of Harlech", a famous Welsh song that has been rewritten time and time again to inspire Her Majesty's warriors on to battle, as in the movie "Zulu", for example.  So if you want some bland bedtime music buy this album, but if you want to be inspired with the glories of Scotland, look elsewhere 
 I don't know what book the other reviewers read but it certainly wasn't this book. About half-way through the book I closed it, put it back in it's packaging, and asked amazon for my money back...It was just that bad. I don't call myself a singles expert, but I have read plenty of books on the single experience, and this, by far was a joke. The author seemed to have a problem with staying on the subject. She'd begin with a really great point then drift into a story about her friends or some wierd experience she had. It left me literally dazed and confused. I just didn't get it. How did the story relate to the point she was trying to make? At any rate, this book proves the saying once again, never judge a book by it's cover. The cover of this book has some really good key points to draw you in. The inside, however, is a hollow catastrophe. 
 Enough reviewers have groused that the verdict is in -- The Owl and the Pussycat WAS a classic that rocked, until the idiot Babs and the Columbia scissor boys got hold of it.  If I were Buck Henry, I'd be angry.  The majority of people who would be interested in this film ALREADY SAW IT in our relative youth.  That means we saw Babs nude and we heard the "F" word that had everyone talking, as she tells off a bunch of moochers.  More than a few of us need to give Columbia a piece of our minds.  This is unconscionable.  The nude scene was NOT destroyed, it was BLOCKED from the collar bone down (she was laying in Barney's bed, asking "Whatdaya think?" just before Felix joined her.  It still exists in the vault.  I own a copy with the "F" word intact, and in context, it only makes it funny.  COLUMBIA, NOW HEAR THIS: GIVE US THIS FILM IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM, OR GIVE US NOTHING! 
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 This was originally a fabulous 4-color printed book, but, it has been reprinted with very poor quality black & white photocopy looking pages. I contacted the "publisher" who basically said tough luck, this is business, and this is how we make our money. Buy it used!!! Because as you may have figured out, an art education book with low quality black and white examples is worth it's weight in beans 
 This book is a little pricy and is not really intended for the small job shop.  
 This film is AWFUL! Once again Hollywood misuses the amazing talents of that "MOST BEAUTIFUL and SENSUAL" of actresses,GINA GERSHON.LOVED GINA but HATED the film/THe two-star rating was for GINA,she is ALWAYS GREAT 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 I got this book in hopes it would help me figure out or discover what I should do. There are exercises, etc, but I got to probably the first 50 pages then skimmed the rest. I wasted an hour on it...I did not feel like wasting any more time on it. Maybe I should become a reviewer and help people stay away from bad books and products. Maybe this book did help?!? 
 This short book, written from a Protestant fundamentalist view, reads like a collection  of a few sermons, (certainly not academic!). The authors have a few good insights. For example, that the ecological crisis does not come from Christianity, but from modernity, but then, while praising medieval, traditional Christianity, they don't seem to see that this is contrary to Protestantism. Furthermore most the book rests on special pleading (not even solidly grounded, but using a citation here or there from other fellow protestants), some citations from the Biblical writings or some historical misunderstanding. 
 This book is aboslutely worthless, unless you're totally clueless and have never ventured over 20 miles from your place of birth 
 Our protagonist is over his head, and below my serious consideration. The book ends on a "Aren't we great" theme (hardly surprising) and the protagonist really in over his head.  I got tired of Jake's continual self-effacing comments, which makes the ending even more implausible. He's a nice guy, which seems his total claim to fame. I cannot seriously recommend this book to a friend 
 I remember liking this book as a child and I thought I could get this book for my daughter.  The board book has been so abridged that it lacks a lot of things that I thought were funny.  AND what about that "climatic ending" where the apples all topple - Not there! I wouldn't even recognize the wording in the board book as Dr. Suess's 
 I received this tablet and it looked real good I loved it --I pluged it in to the computer and put CD's in and nothing--the CD's did nothing the WACOM tablet doesn't work so here I am with the tablet the mouse and the pen sitting by my computer and out the money wondering why I even bothered buying this thing in the first place -don't try it because you might just get I did --a WACOM tablet that doesn't work and then you are out the money plus  figuring  out how to get your money back or how to get in touch with the sellers!!  I have tried and there are no answers anywhere there are no phone numbers to call for help---no numbers for trouble shooting you are on your own no return numbers or adresses you are left with this so think again before you waste your mone 
 I think by the time your child will understand this book he will be 6 yrs old and hoepfully potty trained!  Too advanced for a 2 yr old and not enough pictures.  More information than what I needed to know.  I LOVE the What to Expect books for pregnancy and child rearing, but this book didn't meet those expectations 
 My 2 year old daughter got this for a present and within a month it was broken. While it worked, she loved it and was very good with it. It was often frustrating though when she would push the handle down over and over and get no bubbles. Eventually, the thing stopped working altogether. I figured the batteries had died and when I went to change them, I found that the bubble solution had leaked into the battery compartment. I initially chalked it up to my daughter and maybe I didn't see her do something to it so we bought her another one. This one was broken within a few days due to the same problems. The concept for this is great, but is not worth the money at all 
 After reading the storyline of this movie, it seems like a framing movie, so I didn't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off.   
 I was excited to finally get this book in the mail, but I felt unmoved after I looked through it. I sat and read through it all in one sitting like I did with the first book, but it felt as though everything was rushed. The book was lacking in variety and seemed almost repetetive. Some of the secrets really touched me (don't get me wrong), but the overall impact of the book was lukewarm at best. If you haven't yet, I would suggest reading the first book over this one 
 This travel guide is just okay. It doesn't go into detail at each destination, just an overview. I expected details especially in Atlanta, Charleston, Savannah and Charlotte. I did not find this book helpful 
 Seems like i am in a minority. Book stinks, shallow and desperate. A pseudo scholar..  one of many..  what a shame 
 I should have paid attention to the subtitle: "When Science and Religion Merge." Well, they don't. They can't. I can't believe I was suckered.  I'll grant that the "scientific method" and "mythology" are very different intellectual pursuits. I'll even grant they differ in the prism of the world they see. I'll even grant that they offer complimentary perspectives, at least if one accepts polysemy.  But they don't and cannot "merge." The "fairy tale" is that someone believes that they can, namely Rigas. It was there in the title! The scientific method and resurrection of the body cannot merge. They are contradictions! Neither "FITS" the other. What a terrible waste I could have prevented.  I'll look closer in the future. This is my error. I know better, and yet curiosity got the better of me. The subtitle should have been an obvious warning. Curiosity can sometimes overlook the obvious. I have and did 
 Huge disappointment. Trace wasn't that good either. Having read all Scarpetta's previous storiesbut I was hoping Trace would be only bad one. However, the downhill trend seems to continue. These two books are not the usual intelligent plots Cornwell is capable of writing. Save your money, don't buy it. I completely agree with all the reviews posted so far, so I won't go into the plot -or rather lack of a real plot -details 
 'Gin' Sanders gives some good advice in this book but there is also alot of fluff and just plain nonsense about why one should eat healthy. For instance she continually writes about how certain foods and ways of eating are 'tacky'. While that may be true, real data on the health benefits of the French diet is probably more helpful than being judgemental. I would recommend Clower's The Fat Fallacy over this. 
 Considering the way that the authors harp so much on the fact of archives being released, they show an amazing ignorance of what the archives have actually revealed.  We now have demographic analyses of the Soviet population in the 1930s that have been performed off of the heretofore unavaliable archives and they show a total of about 20.4 million deaths having occurred from all causes (old age included) in the years 1934-1939.  Yet Haynes & Klehr repeat with a straight face the absurd claim manufactured for Cold War purposes by Robert Conquest that "more than 20 million" were somehow killed by the Soviet state within just 1937-1938 alone.  This amounts to saying that old age is a Communist conspiracy. Although hundreds of thousands of executions occurred in these years, the "tens of millions" blather from the Cold War has fallen apart.  What is especially deceitful about Kaynes & Klehr is that they pass on such nonsense in a tone which gives the inexperienced reader an impression that somehow the archives have proven Conquest to be correct, when the reality is just the reverse.  Likewise the myth of the "artificial Ukrainian famine" has been quietly imploding under the weight of overwhelming archival evidence that a famine caused by natural disaster affected the whole of the Soviet Union and that collectivization subsequently improved the food production system.  Mark Tauger is the leading expert on this topic at present and his work draws from the archives in the most detailed way, whereas the more famous books from the Cold War by Robert Conquest do not.  These are facts which are slowly coming out based upon the most detailed archival records and if the knowledge of this hasn't spread widely yet then after a couple of generations have passed it will likely be close to common wisdom.  But Haynes & Klehr do not want the reader to know what archives have revealed.  An inexperienced reader picking this book up for the first time might get the impression that Archibald Getty is some crackpot divorced from the real documentary record and that Robert Conquest has been rigorously telling the history that is reflected in documents.  The reality is exactly the reverse.  It was also clear that the lead-off in the book sought to give the reader the impression that Deborah Lipstadt had somehow rigorously demonstrated a point in a tightly fought case.  The reality is that the whole case was a game for the public.  If revisionism about Lipstadt's alleged expertise is what interests you then you'd do better to skip David Irving and go straight to Carlo Mattogno.  Mattogno is the leading expert on the types of questions which were allegedly at issue in the trial, not Irving.  It's just another example of how this whole is made of misleading suggestions that are meant to steer the reader off of real evidence on anything 
 I'm afraid that this book is so appalling that I just had to add my voice to the chorus of disapproval for it.  I have read many, many texts on this period and this is far and away the worst I have ever encountered.  The text and style are simplistic - almost in the style of a "Children's book of the Middle Ages".  The arguements and assertions are so sweeping and general as to be next to useless, and are made with no reference to geographical differences (of which there were myriad).  Much of the work moves from the period 1100 to 1600 and not the period he initially states that he is covering.  Finally, the book is riddled with historical inaccuracies from errors on heraldry, to errors on dates (he doesn't even get his dates on the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem right), to errors on armor.  Indeed, his lack of knowledge on armor and the timing of innovations and trends would be laughable if I hadn't actually paid for this book.  This book has no redeeming features at all, and can only be considered a waste of precious trees. If it were possible, I wouldn't even have given it one star.  There are far superior works on this period to be had.  While most are quite academic, if you want a broad sweep of the middle ages that is easy to read and accessible to the lay person, then try "Terry Jones' Medieval Lives".  You'll learn a lot more about the period (as it relates to Britain!!) and have a smile too 
 Don't deny yourself the pleasure of experiencing this work. Take the time to read.  Let's stop this nonsensical quick-fix philosophy.... 
 This book was NOT helpful at all! Ms.Warner's prices are very off base. Please tell me where you can find a "reasonable photographer" for $600 or a seamstress to make you a dress for $321. Also, her decorations sound like something out of a bad high school prom, ie "fifties theme, the Roaring Twenties, or a Renaissance Festive. Start saving money on your wedding by NOT buying this book 
 Nickel and Dimed is about the author's experience of being a poor white women trying to pass off as a part of the working class. The book hits on several good points but she could have gotten the same information in an interview. A better book on the poor and not getting by is The Working Poor: Invisible in America 
  (Written for Worm's Sci Fi Haven by countezero, more of his reviews can be read here: www.wormsscifi.com/haven)   To readers of a particular mindset, specifically those who are outwardly contemptuous of authorities like government and law enforcement, Philip K. Dick's Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said (1974), will probably go down the gullet like manna. For readers less inclined to view their political and personal freedom as conditions that hinge on the whims of small-minded men in high castles, the novel may not be so sweet.   Dick, for those who are unfamiliar with him, wrote 36 novels and five short story collections-one of which, The Man in the High Castle, won the Hugo award in 1962. He died in 1982 of heart failure just months before the release of Ridley Scott's Bladerunner, which is based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Thanks to his timely death-and Scott's bold theatrical vision of his work-Dick suddenly became a "poor man's Pynchon," who, "may be recognized as the greatest American novelist of the second half of the 20th century." Not bad praise for an author whose novels never made him much money and were mostly out-of-print until Harrison Ford doggedly pursued an outlawed band of replicants through rain-soaked Los Angeles streets on the silver screen.   What I've written above is the accepted biography, the one published on the cover of his novels. It is factual, but it is also too polite. The whole truth and nothing but the truth, something which Dick professed simultaneously to worship, wonder and write about, is slightly stranger.   Would it surprise the readers of this review to learn Dick believed he had been contacted by pink laser beams from something called VALIS, or the Vast Active Living Intelligence System, which he described as one node of an alien artificial satellite network originating from the star Fomalhaut in the Pisces constellation? Further digging reveals:   "Dick claimed that he began to live a double life, one as himself and one as Thomas, a Christian persecuted by Romans in the 1st century C.E. Despite his current and past drug use, Dick accepted these visions as reality, believing that he had been contacted by a god-entity of some kind, which he referred to as Zebra, God, and most often VALIS. He saw Rome as the pinnacle of materialism, which, after forcing the Gnostics underground 1900 years earlier, had kept the population of the Earth as slaves to worldly possessions. Dick believed that VALIS had contacted him and unnamed others to induce the "impeachment" of Richard M. Nixon, whom Dick believed to be the current Emperor incarnate."   Biography can either add illumination to a reader's comprehension of an author's works, or it can muddle it. I've chosen to mention some of Dick's lesser known eccentricities because I believe it is almost impossible to understand Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said without knowing something about the questionable beliefs and obvious passions that drove the man behind the rhetorical curtain to pull the particular plot levers he did.   Beyond the paranoid details Dick sprinkles throughout the opening pages of the novel-America is a police state in which everyone must carry I.D. cards, college campuses have been closed off by the military and blacks have been sterilized to cut down on the crime rate-there isn't too much to gawk and gape at for the reader. A television celebrity named Jason Taverner, who is the idol at the center of "the big worshipping world of viewers," receives an interesting comeuppance from one of the attractive celebrity wannabes he's been spending some nocturnal hours with. Because Taverner has failed to land said Lady a record contract, as he promised, she shoots him in the chest with a Callisto cuddle sponge, some sort of life form which apparently has 50 feeding tubes that like to burrow into a person's chest. When he wakes up, alone in a dilapidated room, he discovers no one has the foggiest idea who he is. Even, his fellow celebrity lover, though Taverner possesses her private phone number and can describe a number of intimate details about her. But what's worse, remember folks he's living in a police state, is that there is no official documentation to prove anyone named Jason Taverner ever existed.   No celebrity, no status, no identity. "I don't exist," Taverner mentally moans. Existence being one of Dick's favorite topics, it's hard to read this line and not smirk. Taverner does exist, of course. He thinks, therefore he is. What's bothering him, beyond playing cat-and-mouse with the police, who know all about the forged papers he is forced to acquire, is that nobody recognizes him as Jason Taverner, celebrity extraordinaire-at one point, Taverner even discovers a selection of his records, but when he plays them they are blank.   Had the novel stayed with the idea of identity it might have worked. After all, what is identity? Are we are all self-contained solipsists, whose identities are totally the result of our own internal thoughts? Or are we shaped by our deeds and what other people think of them? Is a celebrity a celebrity simply because of the attention given to them, or do they possess some unquantifiable glimmer of brilliance? Certainly the people Taverner meets in the novel keep noticing special things about his post-celebrity-self, despite the fact they've never laid eyes on him before. He shines, he sparkles, he's handsome and he has a way with words and carries himself in a manner that defies ordinariness, even though for all intents and purposes he is no different than them. He's special, without having earned such an adjective.   But unfortunately, Dick abandons this promising narrative in favor of another. Enter Police General Felix Buckman, one of the police state's higher-ups who has a drug-addled, insane sister who ends up being the critical cog in the entire ebb and flow of events. As it turns out, Alys has been experimenting with a substance called KR-3, which bends time and space temporarily to create an alternate reality interlaced or superimposed over the actual one.   "Anyone affected by it is forced to perceive irreal universes, whether they want to or not...Taverner (who was affected with the drug) passed over into a universe in which he didn't exist. And we (the people he came into contact with) passed over with him because we're objects of his perception," Buckman's aides explain.   Perception? Now there's an interesting theme. Too bad Dick fumbles it when he is trying to wrap up his novel with the above explanation. And if those fine words don't quite wrap things up for you, it's probably because any reader who comes to the end of the novel needs to know something about the beliefs of Dick's which I mentioned earlier.   In an essay entitled "How to Build a Universe that Doesn't Fall Apart Two Days Later", Dick writes, "The two basic topics which fascinate me are `What is reality' and `What constitutes the authentic human being?'" To this, add and consider the following three statements.   1. "If reality differs from person to person, can we speak of reality singular, or shouldn't we really be talking about plural realities?"   2. "Reality is that which, when you stop believing in it, doesn't go away."   3. "I like to build universes which do fall apart. I like to see them come unglued, and I like to see how the characters in the novels cope with this problem."   Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said presents a perfect synthesis of these statements. For Taverner and Buckman, the universe as they know it is certainly unglued. There is no one single reality in the novel, there are at least two. But both realities are "real" because both of them continue to exist when the characters who exist within them wish they would go away.   So what then are we to make of the ending, when a singular reality is ultimately restored? I was certainly baffled by it, until I read the essay I quoted from above and came across Dick's bizarre claim that the novel is inspired by the Book of Acts, from the Bible:   "A careful study of (Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said) shows that for reasons which I cannot even begin to explain I had managed to retell several of the basic incidents from a particular book of the Bible, and even had the right names. . . My theory is this: In some important sense, time is not real. Despite all the change we see, a specific permanent landscape underlies the world of change: and that this invisible underlying landscape is that of the Bible; it, specifically, is the period immediately following the death and resurrection of Christ; it is, in other words, the time period of the Book of Acts."   We are all, in other words, "fake humans" living in "fake realities"-with, presumably, Richard Nixon at the helm. Occasionally, we are given glimpses of the truth, or revelations, but most of our lives are spent dwelling inside a contemporary dream. Brush it aside as we will find Tiberius ruling over Rome, the apostles spreading the word. Exactly who or what has thrown the proverbial wool over our collective eyes, or to what end, I have not been able to learn in my brief bit of research for this article. Perhaps Dick, who seems better informed than any of us, wasn't privy to that information himself.   What does all this say about the plot of the novel, about Taverner's experience inside an alternate reality, which ultimate wasn't actual reality but an imagined one? To be honest, I'm not sure. The epiphany in the novel-and the scene from which the title is pulled, belongs to Felix Buckman, not Taverner. Exactly what revelation the scene conveys, beyond eliciting sympathy from the reader for a character who up until that point has been entirely despicable, I don't know. Felix cries. His sister, who he also happened to be carrying on an incestuous relationship, has died. This is sad, sort of, but to what end? Looking back at the essay one last time, I see Dick hints at what he wants his audience to understand, but see if you can follow his logic:   "(Buckman) is Christ himself returned, to pass judgment. And this is what he does in my novel: He passes judgment on the man sealed up in the darkness. (On whom? Taverner?) It was judged and condemned. Felix Buckman could weep at the sadness of it, but he knew that the verdict could not be disputed. And so he rode on, without turning or looking back, hearing only the shriek of fear and defeat: the cry of evil destroyed."   Only Taverner didn't kill Alys, Taverner is not convicted of killing Alys-what's more he didn't even know her in the novel's actual reality. He only met her in the novel's other reality. Is Dick saying we're guilty for the crimes we commit in both the realities he believes in? Are we judged in one world for what we do in another? I live those questions for my readers to answer. What I will say is that Dick's method has ultimately failed to convince me. His metaphor is strained and does not work. He misses, or very rarely chooses to focus on what is, or what might have been the core of an excellent novel. Instead, an ultimately empty "dream within a dream" scenario, something the professors who taught me creative writing in college told me to avoid is explored. Never end a story with "...and then I woke up," or its equivalent I was told in a stern voice by several different PhD's. With Flow My Tears, the Policeman Said, Dick does just that-and it's his zealotry for and his personal beliefs about the faulty nature of reality that have led him to such a disaster of flawed intent.    Two out of fiv 
 I did not like it. I was expecting a bit more of salsa steps instead it looks more like gymnastic. Not good if you know what latin dance means 
 The title of this book is misleading.  to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses  all forms of male sexuality.  This is not the case.  I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book.  The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist.  This is not the new male sexuality.  Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position.  Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques.  The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up.  there are other areas to be explored as well.  If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere 
 Not very good pictures or description.Wallet was smaller than I expected.Quality was OK,not competitively priced 
 It is very obvious from his writing the author has a very strong opinion on what (he believes) is a good finish.  When the title ended with  "How to Select and Apply the Right Finish" I should have known he wasn't going to be impartial about all finishes.  I would not recommend this book for someone wanting a good open minded reference about all types of finishes and how to. 
 I really tried to enjoy this book but just couldn't manage to like it by the last page. This story tried to explore the different aspects of family and self, all through the magical Lazelle family. I found it to be simple minded and rambling. I'm not even sure the author was 100% where she was going in this book.   The main character, Gypsum, receives her powers later in life than her family. She was previously cast as the "normal" one, alienated for her differences but attached to her family through tradition and magic. Her relationships with her family are forced and just seem wierd at times. Not once does the author explain how this family fits in with society. Most of the story runs like this: "I almost killed my aunt through cursing a computer that took over our minds. I need a cup of coffee" The author gets lost more than once in direction and the middle of the book is just another magical mistake after another where a point is made then skipped over.   Everything is so strained and just plain wierd that I couldn't get into it. There is no personality in any of the characters. If it weren't for the adult situations and language I would have pegged this as a young adult novel. I think it almost was supposed to be until 3/4 of the way through the book where all of a sudden a lot of the characters are swearing and there is a slight homosexual relationship explored.   I gave it two stars for some interesting parts of the book that kept me from throwing it away and the fact that there is some effort to include statements about family ties. Blah.  
 Being an avid Hollywood historian, I was eager to get this book about the history of Hollywood.  While the writing is fast paced, and the author has a keen interest in history, I cannot stop finding mistakes that make me question the writer's committment to research:  Fatty Arbuckle, for instance, was involved in a scandal at the St. Francis Hotel, not the Palace Hotel in San Francisco as reported here (and EVERY biography of Arbuckle mentions the St. Francis).  The Alhambra (in the Valentino part) is in Granada, not Seville, Spain.  Most historians believe William Desmond Taylor was gay, not "romancing both Mabel Normand and Mary Miles Mintner at the same time".  Not to mention numerous typos that any self-respecting editor would have caught.  This turns me off 
 These are not the same that come on the earbud, and are not easy to use, or to hear from.  I sent mine back 
 I'm sorry, but this album is by NO MEANS a classic. Just because it has NWA stamped across the cover does not make it good. Just because it is the early origins of NWA does not make it good. If you are a diehard NWA fan it's worth owning, but I'm not gonna tell people "You have to own this, it's so good". Because it's not. Let me show you how this review should really go 1.Boyz N Tha Hood-Early version, worth owning if you want to hear the first version of it 2.8 Ball-Another early version. Also the "clean" version, aka sucky version. Honestly, did anyone favor NWA songs without all the four letter words? 3.Dunk the Funk-Fila Fresh Crew is a horrible band. I can see why the DOC left 4.A B is A B-Good song, not an early one like the rest of the album. Notice how they removed the sh*tty Rappenstein song and replaced it with this? 5.Drink it up-This is just plain stupid. What the hell were they thinking? 6.Panic Zone-Prime example of why no one has ever claimed Arabian Prince to be their favorite member of NWA (his mother does not count) 7.LA is the Place-This is flat out annoying 8.Dopeman-early version, worth hearing if a big NWA fan 9.Tuffest man alive-AKA Worst Band Ever 10.Fat Girl-Funny if you listen to it once and never again 11.3 The hard Way-Even if this song were good, it's too late to save this album 
 Toy broke within two days of play.  Not very good qualit 
 I believe this is the second worst book I've ever read, although having not bothered to finish it, it had potential to rank higher on the list.  The concept, the characters, the plot and the writing were so far fetched that it was too difficult to suspend my disbelief long enough tolerate reading it.  I never give up on books; I read them to the end, no matter how much I dislike them.  Leaving a book unread haunts me; throwing out a book is a Cardinal Sin in my mind.  I made an exception in this case and tossed it in my garbage can and felt no guilt.   The writing is poor; there is no eloquence, no wit, no attempt at a remotely believable plot.  The humor is not humorous; it's an attempt at slapstick comedy that falls short of its goal.  It is too obvious, too tiresome, and often just plain bizarre.  The book was recommended by a close friend who enjoys award-winning books; I assumed she'd be on target with this one.  She obviously likes Hiaason's books and find them funny and involving, but simply put,they're not my taste or to my liking.  Find something else to do with your time, something more satisfying and  mentally stimulating than reading this book.  I've never dared to try another of his books since being so annoyed by Lucky You, so I cannot speak for them.  This one might have been an anomaly in his body of work, although I honestly don't know.  But I feel like I wasted my time with this, and to be honest, if I were given a choice between reading this book and snorting dirt, I'd choose the latter.   
 Don't get me wrong... I like Keanu, I like Patrick, but this is one of the worst movies... EVER. I know Keanu can act - I've seen him do it, I just don't know why he didn't in this movie. I also know Lori Petty can act, but again... she chose not to. Worst dialogue ever, worst portrayal of surfers ever... many, many "worst ever" trophies go to this movie. If you want to see Keanu in action, watch Constantine, and skip this aweful movie 
 I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed. The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone 
 Another young adult book by an author good at fairy tales, but this one is a collection of four fairy tales instead of a stand alone story. The book blurb says that two of the fairy tales are retellings and two are "new", but I found all of them to feel like retellings of stories I'd already heard. I didn't care for the book, but the kidlet loved it. He just likes McKinley, I think 
 I was so eager to read this book. But I was so disappointed when I finally did read it. I couuldnt even make it to the end of it. its so boring. and she keeps jumping from a story to another without knowing what is the real point of telling that story. its like you'are sitting with some talkative chatterbox who keeps on talking and talking till you lose it..  
 I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 I was pretty disappointed with this book. Aimed at the complete novice looking to venture in to portraits for the first time, the information and is basic and uninspiring. 
 I felt the book had highly unorganized content inside the chapters. The examples were vague and confused me further. It's more like a reference book than the text book which would explain the beginner Palm OS programmer the nuts and bolts of palm OS .I read the online docs for palm os4.0 sdk and found them much more informative than the book 
 The authors do an adequate job of presenting the crisis of climate change in the first four chapters. The  book is touted as being scientifically rigorous while Bo Kjellen, in the forward, states that it 'provides facts enabling readers to form an independent view of the problems.' This is true for the first 4 chapters. But when it comes to solutions,  both of these authors are clearly in the anti-nuclear 'camp' for alternative energy policy. On page 11 they make this sweeping negative statement:  "Concerns over safety and long term storage of rad waste remain and it is not clear that its potential as an adaptation to climate change offers sufficiently strong justification to overcome economic barriers."  And so nuclear energy quickly gets buried by these authors, never to return again in this title. No sources are cited for this justification. No maps/statistics of countries with successful nuclear energy programs like France and Japan. No mention of nuclear energy's safety record in the US or worldwide (compared to natural gas, coal, oil). No chapter on the pros and cons of the latest nuclear energy technology. No estimation of energy demands the US will have when we're past the peak of oil and gas (which may have occured). No talk of eliminating dependency on foreign oil or the need for immediate and massive carbon emission reductions that are ONLY possible--in the short run-- w/ nuclear energy.  It's that simple...minded.  Why is this bias so prevalent? James Lovelock in the REVENGE OF GAIA treats this uninformed bias(propaganda?)in some detail in his chapter Sources of Energy. The romantic notion that renewable energy (4% of current world totals) will have significant impact on adequately quelling carbon emissions is the modern day techno-barbarism promoted by these authors. Yes, renewables (geothermal tidal, solar, etc.) WILL rise in use world wide, but to put such faith in renewables when a 60-80% reduction of carbon is needed for survival (according to the EU) is tantamount to deception on a personal and public level that only a J. Lovelock could expose, and  so vividly. Again, I refer the reader--especially those with strong anti-nuke feelings-- to Lovelock's latest release to get his rationale for what the stakes are at this stage of our climate history.   Lovelock and many others like myself are simply tired of the 'happy talk' babbling on renewables coming from authors like these as exemplified on page 87:  "Reducing carbon emissions to this extent will require massive changes to the world's carbon-based economy and our current inefficient use of energy. The GOOD NEWS is that many of the required technologies, such as geothermal, solar, and wind power, already exist, and there are many opportunities to improve and expand on their use."  Really? Again, what place does nuclear energy, which accounts for 20% of the energy production in the U.S., have in all of this? None for these two. This is absurd.  Of course nuclear energy is not an approved or 'required' technology for these two authors. Contrary to any 'economic barriers' cited by Dow and Downing, the real barrier promulgated by these authors--and the uniformed public--has to do with ignorance, which ends up driving a flawed political agenda for addressing climate change. (And don't the oil execs love that!)   The views in this book express an unscientific bias that fails to even consider the science, risks, and refined technology of current nuclear energy that one finds in Nuttall's book THE NUCLEAR RENAISSANCE (2005).  The dramatic carbon decrease from nuclear energy would certainly be the greatest benefit to human kind and planetary survival. Presenting the challenges of addressing climate climate with THEIR "facts" on nuclear energy, Dow and Downing do a disservice to the concerned reader seeking a comprehensive solution. Would these authors support supplanting China's dependence on coal(75% of their total energy pie) with nuclear? Of course not. I believe, like Lovelock, that the denial of nuclear energy as a player at the table--and the subtle squashing of ANY debate-- will probably lead to the detriment of all life on this planet. That may sound dramatic, but I believe the stakes are truly that high. We should not let authors like Dow and Downing attempt to rationalize away a technology that, apparently, they have little familiarity with.  RATING: 2 1/2 stars. Time for a revision. And a rapid paradigm shift 
 I wanted to like this release. Some people may complain about the emergence of rappers whose only subject matter consists of cooking, chopping, and selling cocaine; I don't find it too troublesome. In fact, this crack-rap is more appealing to me than the likes of the bling-bling rappers who only talk about how their 'chain hangs low.' Yeah, these guys are glorifying horrible things, and never expose the consequences; yeah, these guys are also materialistic. At the same time, rhyming about coke can get tedious, but as long as it's done with style, it can never get old. Just look at Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... - that album was based around the drug-trade, and it managed to be one of the greatest hip-hop releases of any era.   Unfortunately for Rick Ross, where Raekwon and Ghostface were able to succeed with that classic album is an area Rick certainly can't touch; lyricism. Rae and Ghost had tight rhymes, and their views were far less linear than Rosses. They exposed the penalties of the dope game, even more so than they glamorized the lifestyle; for Rick Ross, it's all fun and games. Now, we all know Rosses story; he's a former crack peddler. He knows the ires of the trade from personal experience, so why does he have such a one-dimensional way of expressing his past?  Where Young Jeezy succeeded last year, Rick Ross fails. Jeezy at least has an undeniable charisma in his style; Ross seems to drone on, and on. Jeezy also at least switched up his adlibs; yeah, they got annoying, but not nearly as much as Ross says his own name, or the title of the song. I can't even remember anything from White House, because out of a four-minute song, Ross repeated the name of the track for nearly three minutes of the song. When he's not going along with his repetitious acts, his rhyming skills are average at best; and quite often, below average. He's not anymore complex as a lyricist than another rapper who shouts his name all the time(Who?), and he's got even less of said rapper's quirky charm.  I've read that Ross has been in the game for about a decade, but he still raps like a complete rookie. There's some hot production on here, yeah, especially on the "Hustlin'" single, and that's why I've given this album two stars instead of one. At the same time, Ross is clearly green, and needs much more seasoning. Could he get better with time? Of course. He has potential, he just needs to tap into it. He doesn't neccessarily need to expand his subject matter too much, but it'd be nice if he could get out some introspective tracks amongst the coke ordeals. Also, he needs to delve deeper into exposing the dope game, and reveal more of its ills than the glamor. Hustling maybe required for some people just to live, but no one wants to hustle forever; and no one wants to listen to someone rapping about one-sided hustling forever, either 
 ..of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty-year-old black women.  First it was Britney Spears, then it was Christina Aguilera, now it's Joss Stone.  The former at least have something going for them; Britney's first album had catchy beats, and even though Aguilera's style is incredibly trashy, she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard.  Try as I might, though, I just don't understand the appeal of Joss Stone.  I didn't buy this album; a friend of mine likes it and I've had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head.  I don't see what is fresh or original about ripping off Janis Joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers.  Maybe it's the Rick Astley effect: you don't expect THAT voice coming out of THAT face.  You don't expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat.  But that effect can only take you so far, as Rick Astley himself found out.   This album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs ("Dirty Man" basically just repeats "You're a dirty man..." with very minor variations, along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling) and the nails-down-a-chalkboard voice of Stone herself - it's a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk, when it can't come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more "cool".  Stone, like Aguilera and Spears, tries to sing like an older black woman, a woman with soul - an Aretha Franklin or a Gloria Gaynor.  But Stone et al. sound like little girls clattering around in grown-up shoes.  They haven't been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate.  Their singing rings hollow to me, show-offy and fake.  Stone could rival Aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics, though she has nowhere near Aguilera's sweetness or range.  Her voice might be described as "smoky" by some; to me it sounds gravelly, sandpapery, and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt.   I don't understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this CD, much less enjoy it.  I guess fake is good enough for some people.  It makes me chuckle, though, to hear people rave about her voice as "authentic".     If you're looking for soul, try Macy Gray.  She's for real.  Try the hugely talented but woefully ignored Tasmin Archer and Karen Rodriguez.  Those are fresh, authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks Joss Stone and her ilk truly are.  The only white woman I have ever heard who could sing like she was black was Linda Ronstadt.  Go back and listen to a Ronstadt classic like "Hurts So Bad" and compare it to this modern-day drivel.  Ronstadt sang with real feeling, real knowledge, real pain - worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days.    I gave this one star because there is no zero-stars option.  Joss Stone is just a musical Chav, an unconvincing shoplifter of another, better culture 
 Just plain, lots of photographs and little substance. Won't add anything new or usefull if you are a skilled cook.  
 why ? because it has good sound dts hd 5.1 master lossless audio the picture quality will not blow you away it just seams flat and washed out and this just isnt a good movie i like tim burton and mark wahlberg but this movie was done wright the first tim 
 The author only gives credit to Reagan for restoring America's pride.  He also presents the same myth about "mortgaging our future" with the national debt.  Hey historians, if we've mortgaged our future, why is  the economy so strong today?  If you make 50,000 with 5,000 in debt, are  you better off making 500,000 with 25,000 in debt 
 I am in fact the "yuppie scum" that many of the reviewers have such disdain for (why, only they know).  In any event, I, unhappy in my present career, was looking for a book that would inspire me to make a change.  Don't be deceived, this is not a self-help book.  The stories of the individuals in the book are half-baked, uninspiring and in certain instances go unresolved.  There are no useful insights or "gems" to be taken and used in our personal lives.  The writing by Po (or editing by his publisher) is disjointed and confusing.  I could only get through about three-quarters of this drivel before putting it down 
 Not as good as others out there, especially the Kaizen Event Implementation Manual. No details or real life information 
 ...where are the editors when you need them?...maybe this could have been a good 50 page book describing some difficult mathematical problems...as it stands it rambles on for two hundred plus pages with information that is shallow if you know a lot about math and incomprehensible if you don't...get it from the library 
 This is a rudderless work.  For the life of me, I can't figure out why it's so often performed.  It's as if the work were written on commission. Every single act bears the mark of duty.    James Yanni comes close below when he remarks that "there is little to recommend this play that wouldn't likewise recommend almost any of Shakespeare's comedies."  I think the problem, more precisely, is that the devices used to such wonderful effect in Shakespeare's other comedies -- shipwrecks, twins, transvestitism -- are deployed here to no effect at all.  There is not a single sympathetic character in this play.  Everyone is obsessed with either booze or money.  The fool is more annoying than amusing.  The rushed, climactic scene in which Orsino, having pined for Olivia for five acts, turns his love abruptly to Viola (whom he has never seen outside her male disguise) speaks to how urgently Shakespeare must have wanted to put the finish on this awful mess and bring down the curtain.  For a taste of Shakespeare's comedic power, read -- well, read any other comedy he wrote 
 The first two-thirds of this book are great. A great Heinlein thriller, with action and mystery.  Then it just gets weird. Almost as if Douglas Adams got hold of the manuscript and decided to finish it off. 
 The Easy Language 16 is only useful if you're already familiar with the language you wish to learn.  I've been studying French for months before buying this product and found it to be helpful when I'm getting rusty.  The only problem is that it's hard to make out what is being said because the sound is not clear.  The recorded speakers also don't bother to slow down to give you a chance to understand or repeat what is being said.  This is good cause it's like listening to an actual French speaker and not a robot, bad if you actually want to learn how to pronounce what is being said.  It will also go over basic French grammar but is totally useless if you don't already know basic French grammar.        I also tried to use this to learn Japanese.  Unlike French, I'm not familiar with the Japanese language at all so trying to use this product to learn it became a nightmare.  If all you want to do is learn how to speak the language it does have a Romanized version of the words and phrases to make it easier to sound them out.  Unfortunately the basic Japanese grammar and Japanese alphabet are all written in Japanese.  For instance, in the grammar section it has the past, present and future "I am"  it's written in english then beside it it's written in Japanese.  You can't click them to have it sound out for you.  In the Japanese alphabet section all it has is the Japanese alphabet and you can click them to sound them out but you really have no clue what you are sounding out.  So it teaches you nothing about reading the language but the test they want you to take are purely in Japanese.  I do want to learn how to read, write and speak Japanese so none of this would be a problem if it actually taught you how to read, write, and speak Japanese!   So my guess would be that you really have to be familiar with Japanese (NOT the Romanized(Romanjj) version) already in order to use this product.  Because of my experiences with this product I would say get it only if you know the languages you're interested in and use it as a refresher and nothing more.  Since I am familiar with French this product was pretty helpful but if I used this as a starter for the language I probably would have quit.  I'm searching Amazon for better Japanese books. So if you want to actually learn a language look to the books with the language tapes and CD's 
 I've been a People subscriber for 2 years now & I quite agree with the majority of reviewers... Same Celebrities, different week. If it isn't Tomkat/kitten, it's Branjelina or Benifer 2. Oh, and we cannot forget "Mrs. Oops, I Did It Again" Spears-Federline. Very little on real people/human interest stories anymore, very little...  As for the actual magazine, it seems I've become, through no choice of my own, one of People's Quality Control employees. After subscribing, I informed Customer Service of my allergy to their scented inserts. I was told a note would be made to my account and I would no longer receive inserts in my magazine. Here is where my job of QC employee came in, with my having to remove these inserts several times the first year, then again the second year in which I made another call to Customer Service. They apologized. Stated there was a note on my account regarding my request then they offered to extend my subscription for two more weeks.  Next problem and part of my "new" job requirements... reassembling my magazine. I received at least 4 or 5 issues of People put together either backwards, upside down or with half of the magazine in the front & the other half flipped over in back. In order to read and enjoy these issues, I had to remove the staples, try and rearrange the pages & then line the pages up by the staple holes to reinsert the staples. Again I called Customer Service to complain. Again they apologized then offered to extend my subscription another 2 weeks.  I've since written to cancel my subscription. I've not heard a word back from People Inc., regarding this. We'll see how it turns out 
 Mostly plastic, with spindly parts and a lack of smooth motion.  Mine came broken out of the box - the plastic cap screw which holds the eyepieces in place had shattered.  Better to spend your money on a higher quality product 
 I was forced to read this book for school and literally fell asleep a few times reading it. There is no excitement or adventure in the storyline and reading it just makes you feel more drowsy with every page turn. Who wants to read about a self-centered jerk who barely gets any better throughout the course of the book? Not me! If there was a list of the worst books ever written this would remain the chart-topper for eternity!!!!!! 
 I recently received this as a Christmas gift, and it didn't work from the start. After much time wasted with their "tech support" the device was deemed defective. Their tech support is very poor - all they could say, "try another Xd card". The device kept freezing my system, the driver that came with the software didn't work, a very frustrating experience. If the tech support was more informative or supportive, Lexar might have redeemed itself. I recently purchased the Sandisk 5 in 1 reader and it works like a charm, right from the start. Their quick start guide is much more detailed, and their software works! Save yourself a headache and buy Sandisk 
 I should have known, with a Dedication, Acknowledgments, an Introduction, and 5 epigraphs before Chapter One even begins, that this book was in trouble. Some nuggets of interesting information are buried in awkward writing, and terrible editing. P. 43, last line, is missing the word "he." On p. 41 the author is off by 50 million people as to the current U.S. population. On p. 104, President Eisenhower did not begin his second term until Jan. 1957, not Jan. 1956.    In an amateurish manner, the author tries to relate then-current events with the arc of Armstrong's life. In the process he butchers the former, drawing away from the wonder of the latter. More errors: on p. 223, he gets the directions of downtown Chicago all wrong: the Conrad Hilton hotel is not off Lincoln Park, but Grant Park. On p. 247 the author goes so far as to blame the Apollo 13 disaster on Jim Lovell: not even Hollywood took things that far!    On p. 279, the author should realize that the mini-van saved Chrysler, not Neil Armstrong's advertising campaign! And on p. 288, President "Reagan" is spelled "Regan," and in reciting the Challenger speech, the author misses the key passage of one of the great presidential speeches of history: "slipping the bonds of earth . . .""     Don't waste your time with this book. I listened to the author on C-SPAN2's book notes a few weeks back, and it is apparent from his shallow comments why this is such a weak effort. I just wish I had seen the show BEFORE I wasted the $ on this book 
 I tried 3 of these DVD+Rs, none of them worked, errors in every burn. I used another brand to burn the session and it worked perfectly, so it is definately a problem with these DVD+Rs and not with my burner 
 I just tried to use Albert Goldman's "The Lives of John Lennon" to find a fact about John Lennon. I heard Lennon's "Rock'n'Roll" album, and thought it was oretty good, overall, so I wondered who'd played on it. I checked Goldman's book. After all, in a 719 page biography of a musician you should be able to find information about his music, like who played on his albums.   But Goldman only mentioned Jesse Ed Davis, on guitar. I flipped backwards and forwards trying to find another smidgen of musical fact. Instead I found this: "Perhaps the most revealing moment in John's relationship with Jagger had come on their joint appearance on the Rock'n'Roll Circus, when a stoned John, playing a TV interviewer, had done a satiric turn with Mick as pop star, that concluded with John slipping his hand inside Mick's shirt and feeling him up."   That's funny, I thought. I'd just played the DVD of "Rock and Roll Circus", and I never noticed that. So I played the Lennon sequence again. The hand in shirt thing still didn't happen. Seems Goldman had an agenda (claiming Lennon was gay), so he made it up. When Goldman wrote, "Rock'n'Roll Circus" was hard to find; he probably didn't expect that marketing and technology would one day make it easy for people to check little things like that.   I'm no longer confident in claims made by Goldman that stand unsupported by other biographers. Did Lennon take a metric ton of heroin, and make an absolute tool of himself during "The Lost Weekend"? Yep, I believe that, because other biographers confirm it. But did Lennon (for example) kill a man in Hamburg, or go to bed with Brian Epstein, or do a voodoo trip to the Caribbean? Did Yoko arrange for Paul's drug bust in Japan? Nah. Get away with you, Mr Goldman. Only Goldman tells me so, and he offers only malicious hearsay, sometimes filled out by his own imagination, not evidence.   My scepticism isn't because I think Lennon was a saint. It seems that the real, historical, John Lennon could be a right bastard, angry, violent, including to women, and a mean drunk. It also seems that the historical John Lennon could be funny and kind and thoughtful. He could tell terrible lies, and be awkwardly honest. He was a bit of a mess, in fact, though he tried to sort out his mess. And historical evidence suggests that a lot of people who were close to him loved him. Not fans. Not "staff". Friends and family. Which suggests that there was more to the man than the sum of his faults.   But Goldman doesn't give us this human complexity, but a hatchet job of no more than fair to moderate reliability on matters of fact. The real problem is not so much that his most sensational claims don't stand up. It's more that the whole portrait is out of register. Goldman mainly portrays Lennon not as a bastard but as a dweeb, a pitiful, weak, loser, stupid, gullible, characterless schlemiel. It's not the details, but the basic picture that simply fails to ring true.   It's hard to present yourself as witty, cocky, sharp, sharp-tongued and astute, in interview after interview over many years, also in private with observer after observer, and for 15 or so years solid with three guys who know you better than anyone else, unless wit, cockiness, sharpness, and astuteness are actually a large part of your nature. It's easy to fake stupid, but hard to fake intelligent.   We know too much about what Lennon was like, from other sources, to believe in Goldman's Lennon. Goldman's Lennon is a wet slug, who could never have made any records.   In a sense Goldman's Lennon doesn't make music, since Goldman avoids the topic as much as possible. The single most important thing about Lennon is that he was a musician, but this book is useless on Lennon's music. Goldman doesn't provide the most rudimentary information about its creation. And if a biography of a musician doesn't do that, what's the point of it?   Not that Goldman's musical judgements inspire confidence. Goldman's Lennon was too incapacitated to make music at the time the real Lennon made the superb "Walls and Bridges" album, so Goldman simply dismisses what the record clearly demonstrates. But Goldman reaches true weirdness with his claim that Lennon couldn't play guitar, but faked it all the way through the Beatles and his solo career.   But had Goldman ever listened to a Beatles record, he'd have noticed that there was a good drummer, a brilliant bass player, a limited lead guitar player and an occasionally powerful rhythm guitar player. That last player was Lennon; there were only four of them, for heaven's sake. From the opening chords of "I wanna hold your hand" to the driving riff of "Yer Blues" - on "Rock and Roll Circus" you can watch Lennon playing rock guitar on "Yer Blues", not disgracing himself in company with Eric Clapton and Keith Richard - Lennon could create riffs and drive a band along, as he once described the rhythm guitar player's job. He was also a good acoustic guitar player, on songs like "You've got to hide your love away" and "Working Class Hero".   I guess Goldman had come to so dislike his Lennon that he was prepared to say any old thing about that literary character. With hindsight, it now seems amazing that a book that contained the guitar claim got taken seriously. Goldman stepped out of serious biography and into "Paul is dead" conspiracy theory territory.   So here's this big fat book about Lennon. It was probably useful, in a way and in its day, for debunking the idealised portrait of Lennon the martyred saint. But can you use it as a source of factual information about Lennon's life and music? Basically, no. No, you can't. It's no use, for that.    Laon 
 I know there are many different Jewish beliefs and approaches. I am not Jewish. The author makes an honest & straitforward approach. A decent read 
 I knew this cable was on the "economy" end of Monster's product line, but I expected it to nevertheless be a quality product due to the Monster name.  The cable simply doesn't work.  Because the terminals are not "split," they do not hold tight on the connections on the video component.  You put them on and they just slide off.  This was the case on both a new DVD player and a cable box, so it wasn't a question of the video component being out of spec.  Monster should pull this off the market and fix the design defect 
 Yes, the cable fits, but the CD driver is just for the 8300. I was not able to get it working 
 On the sleeve of this record, Art Garfunkel is rockin' it pimp-style in the wee small hours. I thought this would be some hot smoky jazz or lean and sweaty funk, but it's just dried-up whiny white-boy music. Dayum if that record sleeve doesn't trick you! The only song worth hearing here is "My Little Town," but you can get it on Paul Simon's far superior "Still Crazy After All These Years" record from the same year 
 I have definitely found the consistency of Showtime's "Masters of Horror" anthology series problematic.  I was thrilled by the conceit, pleased by the selection of talented directors, but somewhat mystified by some of the actual episodes.  The second season, in particular, started out rather unimpressively.  John Landis, who clocked in last season with "Deer Woman," returns with "Family."  While many people didn't care for "Deer Woman" (about a woman with a deer body, in case you don't understand the title)--it was, at least, humorous and bizarre.  I wouldn't have recommended that episode, either, but it attempted something different.  When I saw the preview for "Family," I was pretty stoked.  It didn't, however, look horrifying--it seemed to be relying on the comedy angle.  That's cool, I enjoy comedy/horror.  After watching the episode, though, I think it's fair to say that it's not funny enough to be a comedy, not scary enough to be a thriller, not particularly original, and the twist ending was telegraphed a mile away.  George Wendt stars as an ideal suburban husband who is not what he seems at first glance.  His family, after all, isn't alive--and they're not even his real family.  They are skeletons that he has accumulated from various victims through the years.  When a young couple moves in across the way, he becomes infatuated with the wife.  He thinks she might be an excellent addition to his brood.  What follows should be a fun game of cat-and-mouse, but it just doesn't get going.  I think the main problem is the tone.  Meant to be a satire, most of it comes across flat.  Wendt, who should be having a ball, delivers a one-note performance.  You might smile a few times, but this is ultimately forgettable.

 I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it!  The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up.  I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration!  I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine.  In only broke my spirits!  Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY!  One of the worst workouts I have ever seen 
 A thin soup of potty humor, fart jokes, and juvenile cheap laughs. You know something is terribly wrong when you are halfway through a comedy and you haven't even cracked a smile.  Good gawd, Dustin Hoffman sitting on the toilet?  Robert DeNiro breastfeading a baby? Foreskin dropped into a fondue pot?  Wow, a movie that hurt to watch.  It wasn't even worth renting for free from the public library.      
 The author clearly has a problem with men.  Most of the book reads like a collection of the author's opinions and rants.  The arguments are circular and redundant.  I stopped a little over halfway through the book because I was weary from reading the same statements over and over.  
 To borrow the authors' own words...this book is a slippery piece of work.  You slip about and lose your footing.  It's nice and easy and clear and brilliant for many pages...then, you suddenly feel you've not been paying attention.  The author would say those periods are precisely the places you (the reader) have to identify as that is where the writer decides to add and hide things.  The book is VERY well written.  I learned a lot from the historical aspects of the novel.  There are four intersecting stories going on in this book and I think four separate EXCELLENT novels would have been a better arrangement. It does assist in telling you that 'I have to discover myself again'.  And it profoundly hints that success comes from a little good luck, talent, knowledge and prestige.  I also laughed when I read a line in the book: 'You are tormenting yourself needlessly' as that was how I felt at certain moments of reading this novel 
 I think "Lonesome Dove" is just about the best novel I have ever read. "Boone's Lick" is just about the worst. I cannot quite imagine the same person writing both 
 I've been an acne sufferer since I was 13 years old, and have been on every antibiotic, tried every topical medication in combination with those antibiotics, and have been on 3 courses of Accutane in the last 8 years.  My acne has never been extremely severe...but it has been quite resistant to most treatments.  I was really excited when I  bought this book and read the reviews, it sounded like it might really be the cure I'd been searching for all these years. The plan was a lot of work, especially at night with the ice packs, but I was willing to try anything. I followed the plan exactly as stated for 6 full weeks with little to no improvement.  That was my experience.  
 I come with an axe to grind.  I wrote two playwriting books of my own.  But one of the reasons I wrote them is because I found so much in this one so wrong-headed.  The idea of starting with a theme or intellectual premise is so bass-ackwards as to be jaw-dropping.  In my experience, you don't start with a theme, you find yourself attracted to characters in a situation that compels you to explore them and it.  Sometime during the middle of the writing (if you're writing honestly), you may find out what the play's theme is.  But theme should emerge organically, not be imposed from the beginning.  To start with theme is like trying to build a skyscraper from the top down.  It may be where you want to go, but, like building a building, you need to start with scaffolding and a foundation.  I trust that when I'm grabbed by character and situation that there has to be some underlying thematic pull.  I don't want to force finding what this is out too early.  If I surprise myself a little, I have a good chance of surprising and delighting the audience.  Now, there is a different craft to writing the first draft and doing rewrites.  I suspect that some of Egri is more applicable to the second stage.  So, yes, obviously I prefer my own books (THE DRAMATIST'S TOOLKIT and SOLVING YOUR SCRIPT).  Also, Thornton Wilder wrote a terrific short essay on the subject in which he talks about the differences between writing fiction and drama.  Since he is the only writer to have won the Pulitzer Prize for both, he comes to the subject with credibility.    I mean, when is the last time you saw a production of an Egri play announced?  
 My husband and I were looking for a book to read on things we should do to prepare to get pregnant and some helpful tips on good times when to attempt to having a baby but to be frank 95 percent of the book is for people that are having problems having a baby so if you looking for something like I did that will just give you insight on foods you should eat, things to avoid ect this isnt the book for yo 
 I couldn't get past chapter 5, and that was after skipping through some of the earlier chapters. Dull descriptions, and too many of them, dominate the writing. Characters were about as exciting as bricks. Plot development--ha! This is a mystery novel: why isn't the plot going anywhere?  And lest I forget, grammatical errors abound in this novel. Tip for you, Nevada: something is not "comprised of" things, things comprise a larger object. And Yosemite being at the same *longitude* as Mississippi? Pleaaase! Give me a break, it's barely at the same lattitude; Yosemite is 225 miles north of the very northern tip of Mississippi, and Mississippi is 300 miles long N to S. Hey Barr, are you sure you weren't smoking that dope when you wrote this?  Apparently (thank you other reviews), the punchline is that a plane full of dope has crashed in the mountains and people are swarming over each other to get at it. Big whoop. Come out to LA and you can see drug dramas for real--murder, intrigue, corruption and all.  Do something useful with your time: find a good Sherlock Holmes novel 
 The title grabbed me because I have been noticing for, oh about 14 years now, the decline of the truth in this country.  Unfortunately, this book is written precisely by the kind of person who has lost touch with reality and what truth is (definition of irony I believe).  The reason it is #1 on the bestseller list is because there is a ready audience out there, of similarly detached people, who want anything (and I mean anything - a website with a good conspiracy story and a glass of warm milk before bed everynight is their ideal) that backs up their point of view.    It is precisely why the truth is so out of fashion.  New media streams like the internet, blogs, etc. offer up "news" without accountability.  They allow this segment of society to avoid confronting the truth and instead construct their own alternative realities.  It makes people like Frank Rich, rich, with very little effort.  Why bother checking facts, his core readership doesn't care whether it is true or not, just tell them Bush is evil 
 This is the most poorly written scientific textbook I have ever read. The syntax and overall grammatical structure is so poor, I thought I was reading something written by a junior high school student. What I am writing here is a quick product review, since I really don't want to waste my time, or yours, with specific examples, but there certainly should be other microbiology textbooks that can explain all topics more effectively without the maddening encumbrance of blunted concepts and extraordinarily bad sentence structure. The book is replete with excellent photographs and what appears, prima facie, as excellent concept diagrams to accompany the images. But the book fails in this regard because, again, the context of the writing is bizarre and even elusive. On a comparative level, the author's presentation of module pedagogy is unlike anything I have encountered before. I am a veterinarian, and have studied science and medicine for many, many years. I wanted a Micro textbook that would help me "catch up" with current issues and progress in the field of microbiology. I found this specific text to be an extreme disappointment.   If you have to purchase this for a class ... good luck. If you are simply buying it, as a reference ... STOP now, and do some more research.   For the publisher:  Are you sure you really want your current editors and reviewers on the payroll?  
 The barn is lovely - with great animals, BUT the hinges broke the first time it was picked up by my son. We tried to fix it, but the wood at that point is too thin. My son is very gentle on toys - this is the first he has broken - so it is definately a design fault 
 I found the dvd boring. The visuals were the same kaleidoscope over and over. The title of the dvd has nothing to do with the content.I didn't find any exotic robotics in it. This dvd you will view once then put it away. Actually you may not want to watch it even once. I don't recommend purchasing this unless you are a hardcore trance listener. The trance music is ok but the visuals are hard to watch after a few minutes 
 It's okay :'( I like it somewhat, but it seems really short since they 11 tracks aren't all full songs. The two "New Direction" tracks are really short. The album has the hit songs "Every Morning", "Falls Apart", and "Someday" 
 Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible "Vampires- Los Muertos" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, "Vampires-Los Muertos" is an even worse movie.  Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse.  The original "Vampires" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks!  Definitely one of the worst so called "horror" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!!  Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind. 
 This text, in my estimation, is a very poor choice for a college level introductory course on ethics, which, I am told, is sadly the purpose for which it is most read.  The first chapter attempts to introduce the reader to the notion of morality by examining three difficult moral questions, and the arguments presented by each side.  He goes further than this, however, by simply informing the reader, in inimitably straightforward prose, which side's argument has more merit.  He proceeds, throughout the book, to make additional pronouncements.  Of cultural relativism, it takes only 13 pages for him to explain the concept, present arguments against it, and declare triumphantly, "This all adds up to a pretty thorough repudiation of the theory."  In other words, this and several other chapters amount to nothing more than persuasive texts arguing against the notion being discussed.  I have nothing against philosophers stridently stating their views; that's the entire point of philosophy.  It is simply not suitable, however, for an informative work intended as an introduction to ethics.  No writer is capable of fully and accurately explaining the intricate and nuanced positions of a branch of philosophical thought in 13 pages of text, let alone do justice to the critiques thereof.  Rachels, by refusing throughout this book to adopt a neutral point of view, has produced a text bereft of value 
 This book will probably be enjoyed for those that feel baffled or awed at the conceptual and verbal exuberance of postmodern theory (and their theorists' chutzpah), or looking for soothing, assuring, and easy answers to the difficult (sometimes unnecessarily difficult) questions and challenges posed by this cultural movement.   The author is off to a bad start when he locates the theoretical origins of postmodernity in the thought of Jacques Derrida. Postmodernity is a critical and cultural trend with a strong semiotic, quotational, de-centralizing component in relation to "master narratives" like Western liberalism, Marxism, Freudianism, Nazism, positivism, literary modernism, while Derrida's early work aimed to unsettle the canonical foundations of traditional Western metaphysics. Although Derrida's later work often dovetails with the concerns of many postmodern writers, artists, and critics, it is plain wrong to locate in this philosopher's discourse the conceptual foundations of postmodernity. Another "faux pas" by Butler is to state that Wittgenstein had already solved the philosophical questions posed by Derrida. Therefore, Butler implies that every concern posed by postmodernity had already found its philosophical resolution decades ago.  Butler's fallacious logic may be explained in that, like Fredric Jameson, he seems to believe that the pinnacle of Western culture is to be found in Modernism and its later following, and that postmodernity is merely a corrupt by-product of Modernism. While it is true that Butler offers a few valuable criticisms of postmodernity, I think that he chose rather easy (and forgettable) targets. In general, he has avoided the major postmodern writers, architects or photographers, choosing to focus on bells and whistles instead: fads, gimmicks, shock performances are the objects of the author's condescension. Maybe Oxford UP had a lapse of judgment when asking Butler to introduce readers to something that he obviously despises. Furthermore, Butler's lack of knowledge of anything postmodern beyond the restricted (and restrictive) boundaries of Anglo-Saxon culture make this choice all the more regrettable.  I would recommend a more worthwhile introduction to postmodernism, like Jencks's _What is postmodernism?_, Lyotard's _The postmodern explained to children_, Harvey's _The Condition of Postmodernity_, or Waugh's excellent reader on postmodernism. By all means avoid this book unless your position is already POSTMODERNISM = BAD 
 I am shocked to read the reviews on this cookbook.  It's terrible. The pictures are beautiful, and the food looks wonderful, but the cookbook doesn't hold up.  The recipes will call for ingredients that are not in the ingredient lists, and you have to know how to cook to use it...for instance, it will tell you to use 3 slices of ginger, but won't tell you to peel the ginger first.  Elsewhere, it says to "bring to a simmer and simmer" when it means bring to a boil and simmer.  We tried 3 recipes, all of which bombed--2 of them were too spicy to eat, and I love spicy food.  This is a horrible cookbook.  I can't figure out why Donna Hay is such a popular cookbook author.  The only cookbook I ever threw away was her Fast Food cookbook for similar reasons, and this one is just as bad, although I did hear the Sticky Chicken and Parmesan Chicken recipes were good.  Try them first 
 I bought this Hummingbird Flosser kit thinking that it could do the same work that my tired and circulation restricted fingers do.  It failed in getting between even my not-so-tightly spaced teeth.  I guess I'll stick with Oral B Ultra Floss since it works.  If your teeth are very tight/close together, I would suggest that you not buy the Hummingbird flosser 
 This book is written very badly.  Every sentence has the words "like, you know, like, OMG etc etc" Waste of money. 
 I've read most of DP's books; some I've loved & read over & over again; some were so boring that I just had to skip-through.... I'm sorry to say that I had to skip-through the first 2/3 of the first story in this book -- Wedding in White. It was not as sensual or gripping as some of her better works. Only the last 1/3 of the story was gripping, and I would give about 2.5 stars for this story....  What was worse was the second story in this book -- Circle of Gold. It just didn't make any kind of sense! There were just so many contradictions in this story that made me believe that DP must have written this one while she was dozing-off, and I can't believe that anyone who has the least bit of analytical mind would give this story more than a 1 star!  
 This my first review on Amazon but I was compelled to write based on my experience with this course. The first CD is fantastic. It starts off slow and gives you a solid foundation to build upon as you move from lesson to lesson. Within a few weeks of driving back and forth to work I had mastered all the lessons on the CD and could easily translate the English phrases in the final review lesson into Italian. I was confident and had a good grasp on building sentences and nuances such as how words changed when the subject was masculine or feminine. My opinion is that most people write their review based on the first CD.  And then I put in the second CD. I thought there was some mistake, as if I had switched to a completely different Italian course. The slow, clear speaking narrators were gone and replaced with fast talking Italians who didn't repeat anything, and certainly didn't give you time to repeat in the pause. The assumption appeared to be that I already understood the language and this was merely a refresher course. Within ten minutes I knew this was no longer the course for me. I listened to the entire second CD just in case this was all a joke and at some point they would slow down and actually help me learn Italian. No such luck! I have gone back to using the first CD for practice while I wait for the Pimsleur Italian course to arrive 
 I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This "game" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy 
 When I got this book to study for the GRE, I thought it would be great. I memorized the list using flashcards and reviewing them daily. I was pumped.   Then i took the test and my experieince corroborates the two reviews immediately below: NONE of these words were on the test! When I took the GRE a few years ago (that time for my Masters degree), I used a Kaplan vocabulary book and, as I recall, its word list was more represented on the GRE. In addition, it's layout was a bit better.   This book is quite simply a list of words and definitions (without pronunciation keys) interspersed with a few quizzes to test you. By contrast, Kaplan's book, while similar, had things like pronunciation keys (it is easier to memorize words you can pronounce), more creative quizzes, and a nicer layout (words went from easier to harder, rather than straight alphabetical.)  All in all, I've been disappointed with Princeton Review more times than once, and I would reccomend vocab and verbal books by Kaplan over PR any day. This is no exception. 
 Let's face it: not many people are actually reading the original "Oliver Twist" novel anymore. The character of Fagin in most people's minds comes from the 1968 musical "Oliver!," where the anti-semitism rife in the book was completely pruned, and Fagin's own malevolence against other characters changed into sympathy. There have been a few other movie adaptations, but none with the cultural impact of the musical.   Eisner apparently felt he was addressing a literary wrong. Maybe so, but it's a wrong that few remember. The story itself is difficult to engage in, since Fagin was so one-dimenstional in the novel that giving him a childhood and rounded motivations comes off as just odd. There's much better Eisner out there...go for that first. 
 Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again 
 The Quest was one of the movies that began the descent of Jean-Claude Van Damme from a major motion picture star into a straight-to-video movie star, which still is better than most actors accomplish, but far from the level that Van Damme achieved at the height of his success.  The Quest is a poor ripoff of Bloodsport and Kickboxer about a martial arts tournament with Roger Moore thrown in for comic relief. While there are some good fight scenes, they don't make this film worth watching or buying. Fortunately, Jean-Claude made many more that are worth watching 
 King of run-on sentences, that is.  The problem with Benford's books isn't the story.  This book, along with the first in the series, In the Ocean of Night, presents an absolutely fabulous story.  Benford has come up with a really excellent idea for a series of books.  The problem is Benford's writing.  For some reason, Benford forgets that "science fiction" consists of two words.  He places much emphasis on the first word, but doesn't realize that it's fiction.  Mr. Benford, this is not a science textbook!!!!!!!  Getting the science right in a fictional book is all well and good, but if one can use the book to teach a physics class, then the writer's priorities are a wee bit skewed.  If you wish to write a textbook, then write a textbook, and leave the fiction to fiction authors.  In addition to putting waaaaaaaaaaay too much emphasis on the science, the structure of his writing leaves much to be desired.  As previously mentioned, he seems to have an ongoing love affair with the run-on sentence.  There are literally whole paragraphs in the book which are nothing but one huge sentence.  And you can forget trying to follow a conversation via the use of properly placed quotation marks.  A quotation mark is to Benford what holy water and crosses are to vampires.  I give this book 2 stars simply because the writing is so horribly bad.  The idea behind the story rates a stellar 5 stars, but I had to subtract at least 3 for Benford's pitiful excuse for prose.  I actually feel that giving it 2 stars is a generous showing on my part, as I was sorely tempted to give it 1.  A word of advice to the prospective reader of this series:  Read it after having a couple of glasses of wine.  It helps.  (Seriously. 
 I purchased this product for my niece,having had positive experiences with similar items,and finding the price to be too tempting.However,what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset.The screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver,the titles suffered from redundancy,and many of them required the use of too many buttons.What was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed; perhaps fewer similar titles and a re-configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product 
 Fortunately I obtained this DVD from the library & didnt have to pay for it.  Very one sided.  Almost completely avoids discussing both sides.  Recomnmend instead, DA Vinci Codde Decoded,  Jesus, Mary & Da Vinci or Unlociking Da Vinci's Code.  Check Amazon reviews & rating on these other DVDs 
 i, was expecting to see something on asthma. i, have suffered since birth with this disease. i, have lost jobs and endured discrimination, as a result of this age old disease.  a freind, who knows my medical history personally, recommended the book to me, and i, ordered it the same day 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 Disappointing. Little if any information about European and English watches. Misleading title should be call American watches and a few others.  Unless you are into American watches - a waste of time and mone 
 some stories date really badly, and this film based on a major broadway hit of a few years before is one. all the social satire of looking back is predicated on a 1970s POV, and that view is in itself so skewed that practically none of it is either funny or relevant. decent enough work by alan alda and ellen burstyn, but the writing and directing cant be compensated for. 
 With an 8-year old son learning how to make friends,and handle new situations at school, I was searching for a book to help him along.  This book had suggestions like "smile" and "give people compliments" and I didn't think it was appropriate at all for the issues an 8-year old faces at school.  It was way too shallow and didn't address real issues.  I did buy another book at the same time from Amazon that was much better - "Good Friends are Hard to Find" and I thought it addressed very specific issues and gave great advice on how to handle each one 
 This DVD's 40-minute program covers the very basics of newborn care.  Please note that the content is on caring for a newborn; if your baby is already a few weeks old, you most likely won't need this as you won't be able to learn anything new.  The DVD is divided into over a dozen chapters.  Each cheapter is very short, with a nurse (or is she a midwife?) demonstrating newborn care techniques, such as feeding, swadding, dressing, etc.  She never explains in detail some of the intricacies in caring for a baby.  For example, if a baby cries her heart out during diaper change, what should a parent do?  In the end, this title feels incomplete and unsatisfactory.  The "bonus" chapter on baby gear is a complete joke, with the model quickly running through a list of things while pointing her right hand at each in the same way.  Really annoying.  I would not recommend this video at all unless you are (like I was) completely clueless.  Even then, you can find this at your local library or on Netflix 
 Dull and inane come to mind. Consists mostly of Peabody's artificially "catty" - sometimes racist - first-person remarks about everyone she meets (even the cat), fuzzy descriptions of Egyptian "archaeology" (...). The plot is slow moving, cliché and peopled with characters that come across as cardboard cutouts. I found more of pennance than pleasure in this read. Avoid it 
 Among the previous reviews, "M. Garrison" and "Liz in VT" summarize well my own conclusions of Dancing Naked . . ., so I will not repeat the obvious.  It is rare for me, however, not to finish a book -- even tedious or badly written ones; but I finally had to throw in the towel on this one.  It was impossible to escape the author's own agenda 
 Verne's publisher called this "lackluster and lifeless," so it was locked up in a safe and never released.  Reading it, I can understand why. The characters are boring and predictable, and the dialogue is flat. Verne's vision of the future is not particularly intriguing.  Really, this book is only worth reading for Verne's sometimes prophetic predictions. He imagines the elevator, the automobile and fax machines, for example.  Not horrible, but not up to the standard I expect from Verne 
 This book was okay for a beginner, I suppose, but the way I see it, anyone that would be aware of and interested in astrological transits is looking for something more substantial.  Howard Sasportas' book on the transits of the outer planets, Gods of Change, is a much more useful tool, although it would be wonderful to see a full length book on Uranus 
 I have loved Hermann Hesse's novel Siddhartha for many years, having first read it in psychology graduate school in 1974 and then 10 years later. But all those who know and love Hesse's wonderful novel Siddhartha know that it is primarily a novel about the quest for inner enlightenment. Even though we follow the main character SIddhartha through the struggles with his father, his years of meditation in the forrest as a Sadhu, his dialogue with the Buddha, his years of love-making with Kamala, and finally his work and meditation as a river ferryman; yet the novel is centered around the spiritual growth and inner direction of the main character.The plot is secondary to the inner growth of the main character. In fact, it has less plot than almost any novel since the tensions are not between characters and situations but primarily between Siddhartha and himself in his quest for truth.  Thus, this is not an easy novel to turn into a film. How do you show the quest for inner enlightenment? How do you keep the interest of the viewing audience when the plot-line is minimal?  The writers, directors, and cinematographers for this film relied on minimal dialogue and beautiful cinematography of Northern India's bridges, castles, villages, forrests, and rivers.   Unfortunately this was not enough. The actors appear to have never read the actual novel and thus both actors that portray Siddhartha and Kamala seem wooden, stiff, and over-stated rather than realistic.  The relationship between Siddhartha and his father was not fully developed. The relationship of Siddhartha and Kamala was a primary focus and anchor of the film and yet the actors handled it like day-time-TV soap-opera melodrama.  Scenes with the historic Buddha were some of the better parts of the film in that the filmakers had the Buddha voice-over essential clear summaries of Buddhism without ever seeing the face of the Buddha.   However, overall subtlety of emotion and thought is lost and thus the film is really a disappointment to those who know the novel well. 
 The idea is intesting as it is very close to one's experience (who tends to fall in love easily), however, its development and poor acting jeopardize the movie. It seems to be a low-budget movie too. So, rent it if you can. As for me, I regretted buying it 
 Podhoretz's attempt to portray the Bush administration in sunny optimistic terms is partly a desperate bid to recapture the fabled halcyon glow of the Reagan years. It falls flat, because let's face it, the Bush administration is pretty darn nihilistic. It takes extreme mental hopscotch to try and feel that same optimism that Podhoretz apparently does. To give the devil his due, Podhoretz does acknowledge that 53 million American voters-- the majority as it were--beg to differ.  Podhoretz is all sport in his mythmaking. Prince Hal was born in Connecticut, but perceiving the hostility to the North in his new-found land of Texas, he quickly adopts the walk and the talk. Hal cut his teeth in politics, as a member of the "Scrub Team." He was responsible for enforcing loyalty to poppy's administration. Although Bush worked hard to establish his own identity, he doesn't like "psychobabble," i.e. self-reflection. The son was liberated by his father's defeat. No more moderation. As liaison to the Christian Conservatives, Bush forged bonds, assuring the righteous ones that one day he'd "reciprocate by hewing to their views on social issues like abortion."  For the most part, Podhoretz avoids the Anne Coulter School of partisanship. He's more insidious. He likes to plant seeds of slander here and there, sometimes in the midst of some seemingly innocuous statements, e.g. "The view from Paris is, as has been the case so often, echoed by Leftists in the United States." By inference, dissenters are all leftists, whose ideas contain the germ of foreign thinking, rather than the old-fashioned, corn-pone, home-spun, heimat homilies of the righteous right (when in need of a good propaganda thrust, always resort to xenophobia & commie-baiting.) His take on Joseph Wilson is nothing but a glib rendering of factoids, and doesn't bother to address any of the relevant facts. Such as: Wilson's expertise, the extent of his contacts and the fact that there were only a few mines in Africa capable of producing uranium in any quantity--one was owned by a Euro consortium, the other was flooded.  Since I am used to this partisan polemic, there are only a few things that really raised the hairs on the back of my neck. Here's one example: Podhoretz likens the criticism of Wolfowitz and other Jewish Neocons to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. By even invoking Protocols in this taunting careless bad faith manner, Podhoretz comes perilously close to blood libel himself. It also betrays the uneasy relationship between Jewish Neocons and Christian Fundamentalists within the Bush administration. Wolfowitz and Kissinger are as representative of the Jewish people, as Clarence Thomas is to all black people, as Ann Coulter is to the state of Connecticut, and as O'Reilly is to all persons of Irish heritage from Long Island. Wolfowitz and Coulter are fringe elements, so radical and nihilistic, they defy any sane person's understanding. They betray any traditional, sound upbringing. But that's probably pretty hard to understand if you don't talk to at least 53 million Americans who don't share the same ideology, (unless you have to, Ann Coulter. 
 This was the worse book I ever read. As a matter of fact the book was so bad I gave up on it. I didn't care about reading it to the end. Given the fact that the main male character seems to only process criminal information when having sex (some of it blackmail sex) should tell you all you need to know about this book. If you like reading about the exploits of a characters sex life with a secondary tie in to a criminal investivation, then this is the book for you. This book was one huge YAWN!!!! 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 This book is summarized in a single sentence "be a good teacher".  All the supporting comments should only take up a paragraph - not a  book.  And even then, every thing in the book is self evident and not really needed to be written down. The only people that should be interested in this are those in administration - for some obscure reason they seem to like rhetoric - then again - they are also usually diametrically opposed to the best interests of students and teachers 
 There is simply not enough value in this book to justify using it.  I'm sorry but words like Alta Vista and Cisco just should not appear anywhere in a value investing book.  Period and discussion over.  At least not up to the present.  Maybe in the future but I doubt it.  Also there is way too much verbage to describe much of nothing.  The modern budding value investor would be better served by other book including Security Analysis by Graham.  A lot of detail is missing here and much of the analysis leaves one wondering if the authors know what value investing really is 
 The book A Pizza the Size of the Sun by Jack Prelusty was just okay. I gave this book two stars. My favorite poem was "I Was Walking in a Circle" because it keeps going on and on. Some of the poems were boring. I would not recommend this book to anyone else because I do not like poetry 
 Beautiful pictures, impenetrably dense text. I got this because of all the great reviews, but I have to disagree with them. I was expecting "how to create a cottage garden," but this is more like "two dozen cottage gardens and the two million plants that are in them." It was information overload, and yet not very informative. I was very disappointed. I returned this and got _Cottage Garden_ by Elisabeth Arter, which was much cheaper and much more what I was looking for 
 This is a disappointing book. There's nothing here but a loosely related collection of trivia. It reads like a long essay which became a short book because the author didn't know when to stop 
 I was very excited about this book before I started to read it.  Polk appeared to have flawless credentials...surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on Iraq.  Unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met.  Let's start witht the obvious.  The subtitle of this book begins as "the whole sweep of Iraqi history..."  The book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving...physically, the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average.  To be sure, no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of Iraqi history, but of all the Iraqi history books I have read or referenced, this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country.  I would recommend Anderson and Stansfield's book as an example of one of the best books in this area.  The way Polk has the book organized, it would be reasonable to have high hopes.  There are six chapters: Ancient Iraq, Islamic Iraq, British Iraq, Revolutionary Iraq, American Iraq, and Whose Iraq?  He appears to have the important bases covered, but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and half-hearted presentation of Iraq's history, at least at the governmental level.  Another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book.  From an academic standpoint, this is baffling.  His experience in the field notwithstanding, it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography.  The key here is to recognize that at its heart, this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of Iraq, but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the U.S. (particularly Bush) has handled Iraq.  Onto that criticism:  Polk is one of those authors that rightly and (mostly) accurately points out all of the bad things the U.S. has done when it comes to Iraq.  From a moral or humanitarian perspective, of course it's wrong to give support to someone like Hussein.  I think most people would agree with that.  What baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the U.S. had done.  Even though it was not the reason given, the U.S. had accumulated quite a large moral debt to Iraq.  In short, we owed it to Iraqis to get rid of Saddam.  Further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in Feldman's "What we owe Iraq," and Cushman's "A Matter of Principle."  My last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about U.S. intentions and mistakes (and believe me, these are all warranted), Polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help Iraqis build a better future, and more importantly, he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if Hussein was still in power today.  I think it's important and necessary to call the U.S. on its mistakes, but at the end of the day, the U.S. actually helped get rid of a dictator this time.  And even though we owe this to a lot of other countries, I can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case, and that for all the other problems, there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in Iraq.  That chance certainly did not exist under Hussein.  The biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand Iraq, but this book I believe, is doing more harm than good.  If you've done a fair amount of reading on Iraq, this will be clear so that's not the danger here.  What would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of Iraq after reading it.  These are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because I have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it.  While not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as Michael Moore or Sean Hannity, it is much more disappointing because Polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work.  Framed in those terms, this book is largely a failure 
 The first near-half of this books was fascinating: an analysis of how the concept of "space" developed in the West as Europe moved from the medieval era and into the Renaissance.  Wertheim examines the concept of space as perceived through the art, science, and philosophies of the era in enough depth have been worth the read, if not as much depth as one might desire.  The second half is something of a loss.  The chapters on 20th-century science read like nothing more than a condensed re-hash of most popular physics books of the last 10 years.  The final chapters -- where we reach the long-promised "cyberspace" -- say nothing more than her introduction: that there are similarities between utopian visions of the digital future and the Christian conception of heaven. Similarities between a utopia and heaven?  Not exactly a shocking thesis and even less shocking as a conclusion. 
 the author basically failed to understand what is jain dharma.neither in digambar or shwetambar it is written that women can't achieve nirvana. digambar word itself says that when you attain nirvana your cloths automatically disappears. that means you reach such a level that you are away from worldly things.shwetambar is a panth which is seperated from digambar because they are not ready to part away with the wealth they have generated over the years 
 Is This  the Book 2??     Is this a joke from the Joker???    Oh please give me a break.   .  It looks like 1 and 1/3 Volume.   My first impression was "I want my money back!!!".  This book essentially is a reprise from the first edition.  Here we have the same problem with DC's characters,  They are still out... It's a fail,  we will not read again "how to draw batman", "Superman", "how to draw supporting characters"  or any trainings with DC Characters.. It's  bad for us the DC's fans. !!       Anatomy here, oh please you can find this info in the first volume. Hey there are no signal about "Krash Course" authored by Greg Capullo "Vicious Anatomy".     Hey Wizard:  Bring Back Greg Capullo's KRASH COURSE!!!    Not at all is bad here. There are several articles authored by Brian Bolland, Eyes, Noses and Mouths.  Brian Bolland is the Pinnacle here.   
 I am a fan of Coben's "non-Bolitor" novels -- so I thought I'd try this one. What a stunning disappointment! I can't believe Coben wrote this. It has none of his plot twists, suspense, tension, characterization. Instead, Coben has given us sophomoric humor, a juvenile writing style, a plot that threatens to fall of its own weight before it unwinds, and a hugely forgettable lead character. This isn't just disappointing. Since it's marketed as one of Coben's best, it amounts to consumer fraud 
 Rather than being a well organized explanation of what Christianity is and of what Christians believe, this book is a rationalization of Christian faith that anyone with even rudimentary critical reading skills can dissect. The increasingly stupid analogies and pop-culture references combine to make the condescension unbearable. This book truly is for dummies 
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 David Slavitt takes a choice cut of Greek literature and butchers it. Then slathering it with a repugnantly saucy Prologue, and  peppering it with expletives and anachronisms, he serves up this yuck-slice of literary scrapple and calls it his "translation."  According to the back-flap, Slavitt's translation "remains loyal to the Greek originals without confining itself to the literalism that has made many previous translations unusable in the classroom and inaccessible to general readers." On the contrary, Slavitt's The Persians is not Aeschylus' The Persians.  This translation is to Aeschylus as Hollywood's Troy is the Iliad... but more tasteless.  I'd recommend trying a different translation such as [ISBN: 0195070089] 
 No part of the description of this item states that the book is only for Photoshop CS or CS2 users.  Photoshop Elements 3 (which I have)is a software that is used widely and is still for sale in all software sales locations.  The book is useless to me 
 This album sounds to much like Pop music than hardcore Reggaeton. They even have that RBD boyband in this piece. A few years ago LT saved Reggaeton with their producing skills now it looks like they set out to kill the monster they created with this embarrasing album transforming a music of the streets into the music even Grandmas like and that is scary. The only reason for the two star is because the zion and the arcangel & de la ghetto songs. If you wanna hear some real Reggaeton look for producers like DJ Memo, Meka, Mambo Kings, DJ Wassie & DJ Fat this dudes are doin it right and keepin Reggaeton Calle my friend 
 Brown's revelation of pressure releases is nothing new. Any tracker worth his or her salt knows Brown's new revelation is just common sense. Trackers have been using this technique for centuries. Brown's "adventures" with grandfather are fiction. Brown is a charlatan who couldn't track a muddy-footed elephant down a dry sidewalk 
 On the surface, you can't really argue with a book compiling Strummer-related writings from people like Lester Bangs, Greil Marcus, Sylvie Simmons and Ann Scanlon. Much of the material between the covers has previously appeared elsewhere, but never before with such a stunning array of glorious typos.   Unfortunately, Mr D'Ambrosio dually blows his cred as both a writer and an editor before he even finishes what serves as his introduction. "London Calling was recorded in New York City" (p. 11)? No, I don't think so, but close...it was recorded in London. Hence the title, geddit? But it's a spattering of mis-information, disguised as matter-of-fact statements, such as "In an ironic twist, on December 22 he would perform (with Mick Jones) for the last time ever at a benefit for striking firemen in London" which ultimately made me dismiss the book without a whole lot of further reading and fling it across the room. December 22 was, as fact-fans worldwide will note, actually the sad day of Mr Strummer's passing, which would clearly rule out any chances of playing a gig (with or without Mick Jones), let alone making it up to the microphone.   Picking the nit? Maybe, but not when there are absolutely fantastic books out there at the moment which do quite an honourable bit of justice to Joe Strummer's memory and legacy. My recommendation, then, would be to bypass this book altogether and make a dash with cash for Pat Gilbert's "Passion is a Fashion: the Real Story of The Clash" or Kris Needs' "Joe Strummer & The Legend of The Clash."  Mr D'Ambrosio's book, unfortunately, smacks of a careless cash-in with little regard for factual accuracy or careful editing. To state that "some people are missing the point reading it like a biography...that is so dumb and pathetic" -- as the remarkably forgiving and splendidly lenient C.C. Ho of Minneapolis has so eloquently stated above -- is no excuse for such an over-abundence of mis-information and fallacies to be presented as facts.  If some guys have all the luck, then clearly none of them are spending money on this particular book 
 Somehow they managed to get beautiful fresh-faced Kate Beckinsdale and lather enough make-up on her to make her a candidate for Madame Tussaud's wax museum. A bit to aggressive with the hair curling thingie didn't help either. No lead had enough "quiet" time in which to establish a character...they had the depth of Playstation 3 people. All the CG monster's just moved too fast. The thing that bothered me the most...1/3 of the film occurs in "dark-o-vision"...it's so dark you can barely discern what is happening. Combine that with the hyper active fight scenes and rapid fire editing...and whole scenes occur that don't involve us simply cause we are confused on what is going on. I would think there could be some frightining scenes, maybe some tension and dread, heck it's got the grand trio of monsters...nope, not here. We've seen enough how movies are made specials that we are bored by CG cartoons. The "face in the sky" ending was embarressing. 
 This was one of the few books I just could not get through. Managed about 2/3 and just gave up. At least to the point where I called it quits, the plot was just goofy. 
 From the title of the book, one would expect intimate (i.e., sexual) tid-bits to be explored in this book. Forget it, Georgia Hale was almost without doubt Chaplin's mistress for several years but this prudish, virginal woman inexplicably chose to present herself as a chaste, untouched maiden, all the while living in Charlie's Summit Drive estate in Hollywood. Georgia Hale was Charlie's co-star in his immortal 1925 film "The Gold Rush;" she was discovered by Chaplin and she owned her entire career to him. She also fell madly in love with him but claims that she held off sleeping with him because of his (miserably unhappy) second marriage to Lita Grey. Her morality supposedly prevented her from taking the plunge with the Little Tramp. Yeah, right.  Georgia writes poorly, wanders all over the place in her style and tells the reader very little about Charlie besides the fact he was moody, brilliant, beautiful, sexy, maddening and immature. Oh yes, let's toss in genius to the mix, but we already knew all of that. Hale was in a unique position of revealing much about Charlie during a pivotal period in his life; she was undeniably close to him and he trusted her and treated her better than he treated many of his other paramours. But she muddies the water with an insipid and irritating style and the absolute crusher is the final chapter. It's an idiotic dream sequence which goes on forever and is both banal and bizarre.  The most interesting story in the entire book is when she briefly reunites with Charlie at the Beverly Hills Hotel in 1972. Oona leaves the room and Chaplin asks her, "Have you ever married?" Even after 40 years, Georgia is still hopelessly besotted with Charlie and breathlessly intones, "After you, Charlie, no man could compare." Naturally Chaplin adores this line and showers her with kisses. One senses this was Georgia Hale's greatest moment since Charlie threw her over in the early 30's.   In short, a poorly written book, a tome of missed opportunities. Oh, what could have been 
 BAD DISC ERROR - possible fix  After about 8 months just like the other reviewer it stopped working.  I kept getting bad disc error on a new DVD I bought. I tried good discs that worked before but now got the same Bad Disc error.  This is not the first time I had problems loading. Previously, unplugging and plugging it in again sometimes corrected the problem.  This time after two weeks of Bad Disc errors, I was about to toss it when I decided what the heck, I'll check inside to see if it's dirty or something.  FIRST I UNPLUGGED THE UNIT.  I removed the 6 screws holding the cover. You may have to pull the sides out a bit if it catches to lift it off.  With my expertise knowledge. *eyeroll* I nudged the lense mechanism. It apparently slides to read the discs.  I plugged the DVD in and loaded a disc again to see what happens. The lense slid under the tray and started reading the disc. I'll take the elation of dumb luck over the satisfaction calculated knowledge any day! lol  So hopefully this will last a little longer. But at least I can use it again for now ...  I am downrating it to 2 stars solely on the bad disc error. The viewing quality and performance is decent and covered by other reviewers 
 Man, there's no way to describe this movie.  Slow, boring, unidimensional, bad plot, really bad acting... Really low-budget (in a bad way)  I'm not gonna get my time or my money back. I bought it based on the reviews, and they were really off... Even if you enjoy the gothic ambience, believe me, it's really bad.   You've been warned 
 Okay, so to catch up on this exciting new series, I decided to try this revolutionary downloading program - Amazon Unbox!  I selected the first 10 episodes and hit Purchase.  Minutes later, I was watching the first episode, it came quickly, sounded great, and looked wonderful... however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end.  Forgiveable, until... whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video, making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing.  But, this IS a good concept... unfortunately, Amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality!  So, until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds... DO NOT try and download Season 1, Episodes 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7!!!  1, 3, 8, 9, and 10 were the only ones that were 100% complete for me 
 There are perhaps 30 good pages of writing in this book.  30.  Out of 260.  Anne Carson is one of the most over-rated writers to have snuck into the American scene in decades 
 I place this book on the same level as The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  Yes, this is a book of fiction, but its entire portrayal of the goddess Kali--widely worshipped today in India, and elsewhere around the world--and Her worshippers is not only slanderous but dishonest.  I don't for a moment believe that the author actually thinks those who worship Kali are all child-murderers, sadists, and psychopaths...but those he fictionally portrays are.    Worse, he portrays Kali as a demon.  This is comparable to writing a fiction book portraying Mohammed as a child molester or Jehovah as a sadistic voyeur.  Kali is the obvious choice, the easy one, as She combines the famous Western combination of Occidental prurience and horror at Oriental depravity.  Kali superbly fills this bill, as She is naked, black, and rules the dimension of death.    Kali is unknown to the TV-watching West save through movies like "Gunga Din" and "Indiana Jones" (the one that has the hidden temple in it).  Both of these films are based on the myth of thuggee--the Thugs--a creation of the British colonial racist imagination.  Sleeman (the Brit responsible for this bit of slander) cobbled up "evidence" with no basis other than his own hearsay and considerable store of contempt for the "wogs," and presto--you have Kali the goddess of murder.   Simmons's book is simply another thuggee story, albeit set in a modern context.  I will not dignify this trash by writing more about it 
 To begin with, I was extremely disappointed after reading this book. I didn't expect something akin to Said's profound work, Orientalism; but this book turned out to be a total joke. It has a little bit of everything (Bahbah's post-colonialism, Marxism, Religious Fundamentalism, Lacan's psycho-analysis, etc.), but does not offer any insightful ideas why non-westerners have built hatred toward Western culture.   Somehow, it gives interesting discussion that the origin of Occidentalism is actually stemmed from Germany and Russia; but that's it. Extremely obsolete arguments regarding religion, god, sex, and "City of Greed;" with the absence of profound discussion about this aged, entangled gap between Western and non-Western world --to be honest, I would say this is total waste of time.  Occidentalism is not about "isms." It has to be carefully examined within the past and current historical context regarding what American and European governments did to the rest of the world in terms colonization and foreign policy.     
 I got this for my eight year old. Unfornately I read the reviews on Amazon just before he opened it, not before I bought it.  This is a great idea very poorly implemented.  I am completely dissappointed, and if I had not bought it at a final clearance sale... would be bringing it back.  My son's previous method of holding a piece of paper over what he wants to copy and then taping them to a well lit window is much better and cheaper 
 This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard 
  ok maybe I am reading the wrong books she writes lol. This is the second and it was not good. Too rushed with the romance, and it was really boring not much drama at al 
 My favorite series ever, but that's been covered elsewhere.  I love owning the complete set, seasons 1 through 7...however...the show isn't a miracle cure for the hard of hearing.  I suppose the extra 5 cents per unit to add English subtitles put y'all over budget top.  It must be nice to have a captive audience, you should only have the opportunity to learn the lesson of LAST TUESDAY!! 
 These broke within the first 3 days of use. 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located 
 took way too long to be delivered...I wanted it before Christmas and didn't get it...over two weeks to delive 
 I am a big fan of Kathy Smith but this video is quite outdated -- I don't know the date but guessing late '80s.  The workout is fine but wish I bought something more up to date since so much about pregnancy fitness has changed in the last 10 years.  In the middle of the workout, there is an unnecessary pause where Kathy and the others in the video stop to perform a rap song...awfully silly and waste of precious time! 
 after the scary and funny "return of the living dead" i couldn't wait to see this one,know what? turns out i could have waited to see it because this is the PITS!!!!!!!! how could they have blown this movie so bad!! not funny,not scary,and not worth the price!!!!!!!!! stay away!!!!!!! 
 This is a wonderful collection of tunes, but it is mastered at a very low level.  I have to crank the volume up to get to typical listening levels.  That just ain't cool; many details in the music are lost.  Re-master this and it's easily five stars 
 If an author sets out to write a collection of short stories about adultery, you'd think they'd have a lo say about it, right? Well, Ford certainly expends plenty of words, but the net impact of them is next to nothing by the end of this incredibly feeble navel-gazing group of stories. Mind-numbingly similar in tone and temperament, the ten stories center of upper and upper-middle class white, middle-aged, married professionals who seem to have drifted into infidelity. Story after story plods cautiously along, poking at the consequences of adultery in a very mild way, with leaden dialogue and a lot of empty moodiness. Adultery is treated almost as a kind of bland rite-of-passage for a disconnected male. Marital infidelity can happen in so many ways for so many reasons, and yet Ford seems interested in only a very limited field of it. I have no idea what his personal background or situation is, but it's a collection you read and leave wishing the author had worked out their issues in therapy or something. If he wasn't such a literary bigshot, there's no way this would have been published-it strikes the same note over and over and over, and isn't provocative, insightful, or even interesting. PS. If you were planning on the audio version, don't. Ford is a terrible reader, sounding like someone reading the telephone book aloud as punishment 
 Shaw, who more than any of his contemporaries dealt provocatively with the crucial issues of his day, has not worn well.  In a 1971 encyclopaedia I had as a child, the entry on GBS called him the greatest dramatist since  Shakespeare.  That's better than Moliere, Sheridan, Strindberg, Ibsen,  Wilde, Jarry, Chekhov, Brecht, Ionesco, Beckett!  Such a laughable  proposition is untenable today, and we can now see Shaw for what he is - a  superficially amusing farceur, who squandered this modest gift on deadly  social comment, deadly because he reduced issues that effected real people  to theorems, and reduced those people to mere mouthpieces.  There is no  subtext in Shaw - everything is expounded tediously and teeth-grindingly on  the surface.   ARMS AND THE MAN is one of his better efforts, and, after an  uncertain start, settles into some nice old-style farce - hidden  identities, buffoonish heroes, scheming servants, crusty old majors; when,  though, the puppets start lecturing us on war, idealism, class, gender  etc., one's heart sinks, not because what Shaw says isn't true, but because  a letter to the Times would have been a better place to say it.  While  Wilde's plays grow with the years, seeming richer, more meaningful,  brutally satiric, bursting with complex and fluid themes, Shaw's work, in  their steadfast refusal of mystery and ambiguity, seem chilly and remote 
 I always judge music, not by the first few auditions, but whether or not I listen to it in the future.  As in the case with Tosca's latest release, Dehli9, a year after I bought it, it is gathering dust.  This does not detract from the quality production value and the sheer talents of D&H (Dorfmeister and Huber).  However, I am still listening to Tosca's masterpiece, Suzuki, on a regular basis for the past 5 years.  I expected Dehli9 to be another graceful yet complex work but after the first few listens, I was bored with the music.  Most tracks are nothing more than lounged-out versions of deep house music.  Me and Yoko Ono is particularly irritating (and don't get me started on the repetitive vocals).  This piece would be better served as an instrumental.  Wonderful, one of the strongest tracks, still has a jazzy, commercial feel to it, almost like it belongs in a shampoo commercial.  This CD is not the blunted, abstract music we have come to love from Tosca.  I thought the 2nd CD would be bonus, unreleased tracks or a "Dehli9 remixed" EP.  Alas, I was again disappointed by discovering this was a collection of Rupert Huber's experiments on the piano.  Honestly, the music was quasi-nighmarish...better suited on a Silent Hill or Resident Evil game soundtrack.  I have only played CD2 once, never to grace my player again.  In all fairness, this would be a good work to educate the uninitiated to the world of lounge, downtempo and trip-hop.  However, you would be better served by skipping this uninspired work and head to the good stuff, like Suzuki and Opera.  Hey, even the Honey EP gets better marks!  Maybe there will be a "Dehli9 in Dub" in the future?  It can't be any worse than the original...or can it? 
 With the credentials of these authors, I expected something better.  The book is not well-edited; typos abound and the sentence structure is frequently shaky, to say the least.  I would not normally continue reading a book that suffers from as many grammatical problems as this one does.  However, the logical and systematic way in which the authors examine the available material on abductions is interesting, and some good points are raised regarding the validity of the research that has been done thus far on this controversial subject.  This was enough to sustain my interest through about half the book; after that, I began to notice flaws within the authors' arguments which were no less inconsistent than those upon which they had harped for the better part of the book.  It appears to me that they are as prone to jump to conclusions as the investigators they criticize.  The only saving grace of this book is that it does offer a useful counterpoint and critique to hopefully improve future research in this area 
 I no longer work for  Hill & Blume   Surveyors,   Sydney (!!!!!). 
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 i can't rate it because i received (2)discs from amazon and bth of them jammed on me i would luv to see this movie .Beware if your considering ordering it. 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Don't be fooled by the title of this cookbook.  First, it is filled with exotic and gourmet, not to mention expensive, recipies.  The choice of ingredients might be fine if you live in New York or San Francisco, but here in northern Wisconsin many ingredients just aren't available.  (And if they were, would you fix squab or fried rabbit for Tuesday night dinner for your family?)  A second disappointment is the copious use of butter, oil and heavy cream.  This is the first time I've ever been so disappointed in a book I ordered that I will be returning it 
 Very difficult to assemble and keep assembled.  Only purchase it if you intend to leave it in the original box as a collectible.  Not worth the money as a play toy due to the poor qualit 
 I'm glad someone knows enough about English History to recognize the pure fiction of this film.  But in addition to points made about historical inaccuracy, I also had to object to the ridiculous portrayal of Mary Tudor.  Over-zealous and fanatic (as was a common religious stance in those times - promoted by both sides of the Protestant/Catholic conflict), she was not insane as the film makes her in the opening scenes.  And throughout the film, there was this emphasis on milking the passions for all they are worth - no objectivity whatsoever.  I was sorely disappointed!  If you want to get to know Elizabeth and the period in which she lived, I would recommend the superb BBC series, Elizabeth R with Glenda Jackson.  And if you want even further background, look to the BBC again in the Six Wives of Henry VIII with Keith Mitchell.  Tidbits can be gained as well from the movie Mary, Queen of Scots (although a few historical inaccuracies can be found in it - for example, Mary Stuart and Elizabeth never met, although it was Mary's great desire) and even another title, Anne of the Thousand Days.  Those two more theatrical representations fulfill the desire for the more dramatic while still coming closer to the history of the times.  This film just doesn't cut it 
 Extemely thoroughly researched, but author has gone astray with his novel, burdening the narrative with extraneous detail and long digressions that have nothing to do with the plot, which is convoluted and unconvincing. Characterization is weak,and, overall, the author seems to have ventured too far afield from his own expertise. That is, he seems to lack most of the tools of good fiction writing. Astonishing that the publisher seems to have put a fair amount of money behind pushing this book. 
 I believe what the author is saying, but found the book lacking in the detail and critical thinking needed to prove his conclusions. If you want the fluff, this book delivers. If you want an in-depth critical analysis of the science behind the cholesterol myth, save your money. This book is for the cheerleaders of the "chloesterol myth bandwagon."  It does not address the scientific issues sufficiently to support a change in current - and I believe wrong - "chloesterol-centric" thinking 
 The first Jonathan Kellerman book I've read... And my last.  Too slow.  I'm a big fan of the murder/mystery genre but this one is a big flop 
 Then buy this book!  One, maybe two decent images in my opinion  Although art is subjective there are just too many flaws with these images to warrant publication, I just cant with good concious tell anyone to buy this book.   He seems to be very talented with other types of subjects, but his work with flowers, a favorite subject of mine, just left me totally cold.   Check out Sue Bishop or Kay Dammagard or even Tony Sweet they may not hob nob with the rich and famous but they know how to bring out the Beauty of nature.  
 I listened to a CD from the library.  Then bought the book, simply to get the one-time use ID code required to take the test.   For about 20 bucks, you get a quick guesstimate of your strengths.    I'm a bit disappointed, at the lack of direction, e.g.  Deliberative Ideation Learner Analytical Intellection...With only a small paragraph describing each strength.  If you are serious, I would suggest spending serious money.  For example, about 4 years ago, I paid $2500 for a psychologist to administer a full battery of IQ tests to my son (6 year-old taking 6 or 7 hours of tests)  For $2500 I received a 30 page detailed report on how to best teach my gifted son.  If you are looking for TRUE INSIGHT as to career change, I would think that you would be better off investing some real money.  Twenty bucks only gets you thinking about a journey, but provides little in the way of a road map.  If it happens to help you, great. To me, the book is more an appetizer than a full meal.  The website informs you that you can have additional guidance for about $2000.  If you have that kind of coin, I would advise you skip the book and have testing administered by a psychologist in your neighborhood, so that you get advice tailored specifically to YOU.    
 As can be judged by the positive reviews given to this book, Shahak had played into the hands of anti-Semites and pseudo-scholars alike - if it wasn't his intent for writing this book in the first place.  Amongst a great number of other instances of intentionally concealed anti-Semitic attacks masquerading as an instance of objective analysis are:   *Claiming that Maimonides was an anti-black racist.  Shahak deliberately fails to mention the fact that NOT holding racist views of the black race was a very rare occurance in the 12th century Europe and Asia amongst ALL ranks of society.  *Claiming that Jews permit adult sexual relations with minors.  This is a very popular slander amongst anti-Semites used against Jews; needless to say, this is a completely false allegation that has no grounds in the Talmud.  Actually, the Talmud discusses whether the victim of such activity, which is expressly FORBIDDEN by Judaism, should be considered virgin at the time of their marriage.  *Claiming that the Talmud treats gentiles abusively and providing passages from Talmud as evidence.  Shahak, like all other anti-Semites in disguise, fails to mention that such laws were originated by gentiles, and officialy vindicated by European law, AGAINST the Jews living in Europe, who then adopted similar laws to vindicate themselves.  Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.  Apparently, Europeans used Christianity's teachings to live an ascetic life as an excuse to cover up their jealousy of Jewish success and endlessly persecute them.  I could go on exposing Shahak for who he really is, but I simply don't need to, as I expect and hope that these three examples will suffice to convince any potential reader of this book that its content is neither objective nor productive to expanding your view of the Jewish faith as it really is. 
 'the executioner's song' holds the dubious title of the worst book I ever read cover to cover. seriously. it's tedious, massively overlong, mawkish, trite, trivial and badly written. in fact, it was a milestone in my reading- I never just trusted an author to pull it all together again. now I just drop a book if it's going as badly as this one did.  the only remarkable thing about Gilmore is that he insisted the death penalty be applied to him, even tho it wasn't mandatory in that state anymore. Mailer fails to come to any significant conclusion about this, despite having a whopping 1072 pages in which to do it.  basically, Gilmore is a run-of-the-mill petty criminal, with relationship troubles. he gets caught after killing two men in a botched hold-up. he gets 'life', but instead insists on being executed. he gets executed. the end. there- you don't need to waste your time reading it now- the book draws no further conclusions about his motivation, the ethics of the death penalty, the morals of crime, or indeed anything at all. poppycock 
 First thing-the graphics are far prettier than any of the current 3 Caesar games out there.  Having said that-this game had a major bug right at the release.  How is that possible?  Is it unreasonable to expect a U.S. company to produce a flawless product?  Probably not, but Tilted Mill has some of the the best pros in the industry.  Basic bugs killed any enjoyment for me and the scenario editor is an unworkable mess. The advice offered by the techno weenies on the forums are beyond comprehension of the average consumer.    Far better to go with CivCity 3 
 Yet another book about the "Great Game" that isn't great, and has no game.  No sense of person, place, or time can wriggle past the stifling ooze -- consisting of equal parts journalistic drone, hoary cliche, and predictable modifiers -- that lies, awaiting unsuspecting readers, between the covers of this tome.  MacIntyre deserves to be applauded for his research; he should have hired someone else to do the writing.  Here again we have a fascinating subject rendered lifeless by low-level prose.   You want to know about this stuff?  Read Kipling.  He, at least, was not guilty of adverb abuse 
 Axiomatics and superstition make a bilious mix. The book has an extremely narrow ideological focus pandering to the hardcore religious right.  Another sad attempt to set the clock back. 
 The Amazon description says Vol. 1-3, boxed set, hardcover.  That is all true.  What they don't tell you is that there are actually six volumes.  The box in which it comes is clearly marked, "Volumes 1-3 (of six)."  That would have been a much better description for Amazon to have used.  If you have volumes 4-6 and you are looking to complete the set, this book is for you.  If you are looking for the complete set, look elsewhere 
 This type of a book is not read for its entertainment value, that it obvious. The depth of the content is a primary consideration, and in the case of this book, the material is not lacking in depth, borrowing from a subject as rich and profound as the human mind itself - Buddhist phychology. However, the message of healing through mindfulness gets lost in the hopeless wandering aroung in circles, without ever really getting anywhere. Where is this book going? By page 130 it was still not very clear. This seems more like a dry psychology textbook, filled with chapter after chapter of research results, case histories and impressive technical "buzzwords", than an inspiring and sympathetic Buddhist teaching on how to heal the emotions. I peronally have found Tich Nhat Hanh's wrtitings much more "Buddhist", in a sense, because they are warm, non-technical, practical and consise. The Dalai Lama himself has written a number of excellent books on the subject 
 Tunku Vardarajan in the India today says, India: a Mosaic is a con job. The word "mosaic" suggests a variety in the book. Instead the book talks about "bleeding-hearted" essays.  According to him,  the articles in the book were published elsewhere and are "profoundly  stale." From my reading of the book i found the book to be a "do  not buy.&quot 
 I suppose some people think that one can write anything in a book and call it "history."  But I think Smith's portrayal of the conflict is just too misleading to be called history.  Real people in real life do real things for real reasons.  But after reading this book, I had an image of wicked unarmed Zionists maliciously stealing land from hapless heavily armed Arabs.  It wasn't exactly what Smith had said.  But it was close enough to make me realize what was wrong with the book.  The constant whitewashing of Arab misdeeds and criticism of reasonable Jewish behavior had simply erased the motivations for the two sides in the conflict.  Are there books that do a better job?  Oh yes.  I'll give you ten examples of books that are far better, and there are many, many more:  The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Middle East Conflict (Bard, 2003) A History of Israel (Sachar, 1996) The Siege (O'Brien, 1986) A Young Person's History of Israel (Bamberger, 1985) The Rape of Palestine and the Struggle for Jerusalem (Casper, 2003) Atlas of the Middle East Conflict (Gilbert, 2002) Islam and Dhimmitude (Ye'or, 2002) Right to Exist (Lozowick, 2003) A Place Among Nations (Netanyahu, 1993) From Time Immemorial (Peters, 1984)  Try one of them. 
 I received this reacher as a gift when I broke my ankle and could not reach things very well.  I find it very awkward to use and it feels clumsy. The very tip of the pick up part does not meet when you close the jaws, making it impossible to pick up very small items. It does not have a locking feature which is helpful sometimes. I purchased a "Pik Stik" which I find to be far superior. It has a gun type grip and it has the locking feature. It is strong with an aluminum shaft and the jaws grip well including the tips which close and allow small items to be picked up. It also comes in several lengths to suit your particular needs. The jaws can be rotated and locked increasing it's usefulness. The Pic Stik is also less expensive. I do NOT recommend the Medline reacher. Go for the Pic Stik and you'll be much happier with your choice 
 While I found a lot of the material in the book very interesting, it is put together in such a muddled way that it is very difficult enjoy reading it. The book seems to be composed of a number of previously written (and in many cases overlapping) articles joined together with fairly boring 'filler' to try and present a 'complete' view.   I would suggest buying the book if you're interested in reading about early colonial life in the vanilla industry in Papantla, Mexico. Most of the other information can be easily found on the internet 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 I'm glad to see I'm not the only one to notice the anti-White preaching in this book.   Not what I expected at all because this is how History is taught today and this is supposed to be an answer to that.   I was expecting to learn a lot more - most of the things mentioned I already knew.   I graduated from high school in '89 and then got a Bachelor's degree from a state college that wasn't in History.   Perhaps this book would be useful to those who have less education.   
 If she was really any good as everyone says she is where has she been??? "Leave, Get Out" is the only hit she's had. She has not had any other hit on this CD and doesn't have another CD. save your money folk 
 I get the story line but 5 grown women need to suicide!?  The one dare to have a boyfriend and not go home for the night.  Why would that kind of free sprite would kill herself!?!?  It is not matching the character 
 This is garbage.  This "author" uses the term 'guys' for wiseguys.  It is sooooo anoying that I just had to stop reading it.  Use mafia, wiseguys, whatever.  Try reading the word 'guys' about 20 times a page and see how sick you are of it. this person was not a mob 'guy' so don't bother with this book.  as a matter of fact I will sell you mine very cheap 
 This is a classic example of "a band that never made it big"'s second life. The songs are pretentious and second rate at best. I give it only two stars 
 Greg Kinnear and Matt Damon play conjoined twins Walt and Bob Tenor. The two decide to move to LA from their hometown of Martha's Vineyard when Walt decides to pursue a career as an actor. Despite Bob's stage fright, he goes along with his brother's choice and tries to remain supportive.  The film has a variety of celebrities in supporting roles and cameos including Cher, Meryl Streep, Eva Mendez and Frankie Muniz.  This movie was fine, but just fine. At no point did I ever laugh out loud, and I probably wouldn't watch it again. It was disappointing to say the least. I've come to expect more from the Farrelly Brothers after There's Something About Mary and Shallow Hal, but this movie didn't really shine in any way.  If you've never seen one of their other movies, don't watch this one and consider it characteristic of their work. Instead go for There's Something About Mary which has all the same crass humor and unrealistic moments as this film, but with better delivery and a stronger plot 
 I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that Dave Marsh's preachiness and know-it-all attitude really is a detriment to this book.  Before I Get Old is well researched and thorough, the only problem is that it takes all the life out of what is one of the most exciting and dangerous rock groups of all time.  Marsh really fails to capture the early days of the Who, because he seems to judge everything as the elitist American reviewer he is.  In other words, he has no sense of humour and doesn't capture the essence of what made the Who what they were.  Pete Townshend is quoted at length, and he can be a real bore, he does his best communicating with a guitar in his hand and writing great songs of angst, rebellion and rage.  Marsh has done some good work here and there, but he is totally out in left field with this one, he really captured nothing of The Who 
 I find Larry's thoughts are honest whether you like them or not.  I have a problem with his thoughts on Medicare and Social Security.  I am thirty-eight and have epilepsy.  I'm unable to work or drive due to the harm I could do to myself or others.  Perhaps Mr. Elder will give me a job.  I'll take it!  Do you think he will send his limo to pick me up for and take me home from work 
 I had to stop the DVD about 15 min into it.   The information seems to be extremely interesting as I have been working on this thought process for years. I anxiously waited for the DVD to arrive to see what the author had to say about this topic. Unfortunately, the audio and visual quality of the material was too distracting from the presentation. I was expecting something like a Discovery or History Channel type production with images and historical facts to backup the presented material.   Instead, the "music" is horrible, too loud, and it's hard to undertand what the author is saying in places, and the images are a constant collage of the author walking through museums and other places overlayed with images of artifacts to the point of sheer boredoom. There seems to be no purpose of the images other than to fill the screen with something. They may mean something in the author's mind, but how about explaining them to us. After 15 min of this, I had all I could take. I plan to send this back and order the book instead.   I think the content is going to be good. But the production needs a complete rework, better yet, just make an audio CD with no music or at least dead quiet while the author is speaking! If you can get past the distractions, you might enjoy this DVD. 
 this is stephen quiller's sequel to "color choices" with the addition of new information about neutral mixtures (Jean Dobie's "mouse power"), color value and intensity (saturation), color  families, "mother color", and the latest version of quiller's  color mixing wheel, one of the best available. but i was disappointed. the  book suffers from a mechanical approach to color mixing or color families  -- in some cases, the text of captions or whole sections is identical, with  color keywords repeatedly changed. this edition deletes some of the best  chapters in "color choices," such as the chapter on "finding  your own vision," adding in its place a bizarre section on "color  personalities" (each mixed color is associated with adjectives such as  "noble" or "playful"). and quiller recommends a  28-paint (!) palette, which will create more confusion for a painter  (especially a beginning painter) than all the mixing instructions can clear  away. i suggest you browse this book before you buy it: "color  choices" is better overall, and you can order quiller's revised color  wheel from him directly, on a plastic card that is more durable than the  tear-out version that comes with this book 
 Reading this book was an exercise in frustration.  Oates takes three pages to describe an event that could have been summed up in two paragraphs.  But beyond that, she never made it clear why the family fell apart. We saw how happily "perfect" they were prior to the tragic event (cutesy nicknames and all) and then how they fell apart at the seems afterwards.  But we never saw WHY.  That made the entire second half of the story almost implausible.  By the time I got to the end, I was less concerned with what happened to the characters than I was with just FINALLY finishing the book 
 Unfortunately the author did not get the basic premise correct. Ukraine does not mean borderland. The oldest use of the word found in written text is in the 10th century chronicle of Slava o Polke Ihoria. The term Ukraine is used as meaning within the kingdom, at the heart of the kingdom. The opposite of what the author writes. Borderland would mean Okraina, this is the difference between in and out. She also missed that Ukraine has the oldest calendar on the planet now dating to 7039. Another significant fact.  Maybe the next book could be an new history based on  archives from Lutsk and Kyiv that the author did not read. Missing such a basic premise clouds the rest of the book 
 The only thing positive I can say about this movie is Barbara Hershey looks good naked. But who goes to a biblical movie to check out naked babes?  In this movie, "Jesus" puts his carpentry skills to work building crosses for the Romans. He whines to Harvey Keitel's Judas that he (Jesus) never tells the truth, is afraid of everything, needs forgiveness for his own sins--in other words, he fits the the description of half the actors in Hollywood. Before the movie was halfway over, I wanted to crucify this phony "Jesus" myself!  I rate this piece of garbage a negative 10 
 If not, there's not much useful here. A lot of easy reading trips down the 1970's memory lane 
 I don't know where Amazon got these cases of All Small & Mighty, Free Clear.  I use the same product all the time purchased from my local superstores and grocery stores and love it.  From my local retailers the product has no scent and is the consistency of shampoo.  The Amazon case is gelatinous and smells like latex paint.  It also disturbed me that the bottles are packaged differently than the local store version.  At the store they have a shrink wrap label and a large cap for a dripless spout.  The Amazon case has sticker labels on the same shape bottle and a small cap on a non-dripless spout.  At first I called the manufacturer.  Their customer service seemed concerned but then managed to drop my call.  So I decided to use it.  I do not notice any difference in the cleanliness level of my clothes.    I would not purchase this again from Amazon.  The price is not that great to overcome the odd differences.  I will, however, continue to purchase this product from my local retailers 
 I bought this book before a family trip to the Grand Canyon. I thought I had looked around enough at different guide books but I was wrong. This book is fine if your Canyon trip is 100% hiking. Otherwise it is a bit thin and very dry. Not too helpful over all.  There must be something better.  
 I liked this even less than the jingoistic, "glory of war" stuff.  I'm still looking for the serious study that views the world as a hard place, recognizes that for a large part of the Middle East, America is a symbol of evil, and criticizes American public policy from the perspective of the tensions of imperfect knowledge and dire threat 
 This book is unfortunately not up to par for Kay Hooper.  Her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is (there isn't a single clue at any point in time).  The heroine keeps loosing her memory, so you don't even have the usual good characterizations of hero & heroine (since she can't even remember much about herself, much less him).  If you like Kay go ahead and read it, but I hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard 
 This book is a clear example of a teenager's trying too hard to sound world-wise and blase.  It's a book about detachment and nothing, in which rich kids do nothing but take drugs and sleep together and can't even muster up the effort to drive their clearly especially drunk friend home.  Ellis, however, can't let the theme of detachment be subdued and understated, which might have made the book much better; no, he has to hammer it in constantly (for example, two characters decide to have sex but don't even touch each other).  Even worse, he doesn't write very well.  He seems to be trying to sound like Hemingway quite frequently.  Hemingway's long, unpunctuated run-ons, though, are elegant and hypnotic.  Ellis's are just bad.  He goes through different styles, too, seemingly trying to imitate other great writers and sounding only like a kid who hasn't figured out how to write like himself yet.  Appropriate for an eighteen-year-old writing from the point of view of an eighteen-year-old?  Maybe, but it's terrible writing and not worth the effort it takes to read (which is not much).  I am not criticizing the book based on its disturbing themes (drug use, alcohol abuse, eating disorders, gang rape, violent pornography, and prostitution).  Done properly, this novel could be a fascinating and eerily disturbing book.  The problem is that it isn't well written.  We read this book junior year of high school, and I can honestly say that it's the worst book we read.  There's just nothing to it.  It's not a book; it's words on a page, and even more they're the wrong words awkwardly strung together 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 How do I assign a rating? As several other people have experienced, my unit is also DOA. I received it, plugged it in, pressed 'clean', and the motor started up. I popped open the cover, put in the disc I wanted cleaned, and pressed 'clean' again. Nothing. Terrible quality control.  What's worse is the unit case is glued together -- no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty 
 Is this book scientific or dogma? Science employs unambiguous concepts, does not ignore data that contradicts; and revises in the light of valid critique. This book fails all these tests. For a comprehensive critique of its many flaws see Professor Brendan. McSweeney's widely cited paper in Human Relations  (2002) 55.1. To take an example from the Hofstede's book: they state that "the masculinity-femininity dimension affects ways of handling industrial conflicts. In the United States as well as in other masculine cultures such as Britain and Ireland) there is a feeling that conflicts should be resolved by a good fight ... the industrial relations scenes in these countries is marked by such fights. If possible management tries to avoid having to deal with labor unions at all." (p.143). This claim first appeared in Hofstede (1991) and later in Hofstede (2001). Test 1: a national culture does not affect national managers but only national labor. Inconsistent. Test 2: according to the Hofstede's own ranking (p. 121) Japan is the second most masculine country and Germany is more masculine than either the US or Britain. And yet for over fifty years the industrial relations in Japan and Germany have been the least conflictful. The Hofstede's claim is contradicted even by their own data. Test 3: In 2002 McSweeney published a second paper in which he showed that mascluninity-femininity has no predictive or explanatory power in relation to industrial relations. His data showed that sometimes such relations in feminine countries are more aggressive than in masculine countries, sometimes they are less. Despite this data the Hofstede's repeat a claim that is clearly contradicted by the data (others and even their own). A company which believed the Hofstede's claim would be discouraged from considering investing in Britain, Ireland, or the US and would be encouraged to invest in feminine countries such as the Hofstede's Netherlands which they claim is the third most feminine country in the world. Hopefully, not too many are misled by the dogma in this book which bears no relation to reality 
 Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh can be heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised 
 I have enjoyed many of Anne Tyler's books, particularly, "Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant," "Breathing Lessons" and "Back When We Were Grownups".  "Saint Maybe" was a huge disappointment.  The plot and characters were mediocre at best, and a bizarre religion, The Church of the Second Chance, played a major part in the story. By the end of the book, it had completely taken over.  The Church of the Second Chance fell somewhere between a strict religion and a cult.  Yes, Ian Bedloe was close to a saint for looking after three children for the best part of his life, but why the book was named, "Saint Maybe" is still a mystery to me.  One of the children in Ian's care made reference to Ian as perhaps being "Saint Maybe," but who the heck is Saint Maybe??  The closest I could come up with is "MAYBE you will finish the book... and MAYBE you won't! 
 How can this be a great "modern" playwright when the views and themes of this major play have a better part for the 17th century than the 20th? I thought about it and if it was produced in  San Francisco even with it's respect for the arts, on merits the play would be jeered. Woody Allen thought that Strindberg hated women, but I think he just lacked any understanding of them 
 The instructions in this book are not clear, the pictures hard to understand, the final project looks good if somebody can do it. Very disappointed 
 I read this book hoping that it would have good Biblical advice for women because a number of the women in our church are reading it.  What I found was a handbook on how to manipulate your husband. There is enough good in this book to make it attractive to Christians but it is so mixed up with bad doctrine and scripture twisting that you really have to work to pick out anything of worth. The author is incredibly insensitive to women and is terribly insulting to men. Debi Pearl blames every single thing that happens in a marriage on the wife while the husband seems to bear no responsibility as he is just driven by hormones or whatever. A wife must respond to every situation the way Debi says (basically grovel) or she risks the WRATH of GOD which could mean poverty or even "Madness". Debi discourages too much quiet time in Biblical Study or devotions or prayer for women because this is a selfish desire to be more "spiritual" than your husband. She says that serving your husband IS serving God so just concentrate on your home and children. I can't emphasize enough how destructive this book could be, especially to a woman in an abusive marriage. If I could have given 0 stars I would have 
 Though I understand other reviewers' opinions of this book, and I agree that some of the book's ideas were interesting, The Lives of a Cell just didn't appeal to me. I have always loved science, but not in the way this book displayed it. I got extremely bored with this book and found myself skimming chapters. Lewis Thomas seemed like he was trying to sound too intelligent while getting his opinion across, where a simple explanation would have been much more powerful. Some may like this book, but I think there are much better reads out there 
 Nylander's semi-biographical book on New England women's history is problematic for many reasons.  Firstly, she carries the brunt of her argument on insufficient evidence...only four diaries.   In a region that's rich with historical documentation, she should easily have been able to find more evidence.  Secondly, Nylander systematically ignores issues of class or race, instead depicting a very rosy image of white upper class women as representative of all women in this time period.    At the very least, Nylander should have been more forward about her intended focus 
 I have to agree with Steven Willis from Los Angeles. This book might hold up a little stronger if it wasn't written by a publicist who seems like he is just trying to drum up some business. It's like those chiropractic offices that set up booths for free spinal exams at various sporting events. They give you the free exam, then surprise, surprise! Turns out they seem to think your back needs some chiropractic work. It's the same idea here, and while the book has a few instances of making good points, they aren't really strong enough to persuade the reader to adopt the author's point of view. On the positive side, it is written in a manner that is pretty easy to understand so you can finish it quickly enough, but it's just never all that compelling 
 I had to stop reading because I could not tolerate this novel any longer! I read 280 pages, and just couldn't finish it. Explicit sexual scenes seem to be the norm with Baxter these days. In this pornographic novel, Baxter describes two naked teenage children having sex in public, with adults watching them while pleasuring themselves. He goes into graphic detail. It's disgusting and shameful. Oh...it's all part of the story, and their behavior is just a result of the key plot element.  That's an excuse to explore deviant behavior.  I am shocked that Clarke associated with this rubbish, because it reads nothing like a Clarke novel. For whatever reason, Baxter's publisher managed to get Clarke's name on the book. In my estimation, Clarke wrote or co-wrote the first chapter and that's all, because that was the only good part of the book! (BAIT AND SWITCH!).    I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing his garbage now. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost it. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from pathetically weak character development (I am so apathetic toward his characters, I can't recall their names). His use of questionable and outdated physics theories, and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes makes this all but intolerable to a true sci-fi fan. I will never read anything from this former author again. 
 Save yourself the money on this book. The author seems to read some anime reviews, "The Anime Companion", and some cultural anime books, and slop them together as though she's got original information. Some of which she STILL gets wrong. Incorrect pictures for some of the anime, too, only futher lowering the quality of this book...which is hard to do with pictures, you'd think. 
 Despite the seemingly endless fanfare and continual play on the floors of retail clothing stores across the country, I must say I was disappointed with this album - even despite approaching it with the most modest of expectations. I have always seem Madonna as a highly effective marketer, rather than a songwriter, and that impression was firmly entrenched by this album.   I wanted to enjoy it. In fact, at one point I actually listened to it *twice*, uninterruped from beginning to end, over the course of a two hour road trip... But in the end, I'm just not getting it.  There are certainly some catchy hooks on this disk. "Get Together" features some addictive rhythms, and a few of the songs include some groovy bass lines. But in the end, instead of seeming like an extension of her previous work, the effort instead sounds strained and derivative. It doesn't help that Madonna's effective songwriting vocabulary remains akin to what one might expect in a 14 year old cheerleader. Stretched and overwrought, she somehow manages to simultaneously sound both simplistic and contrived.    In the end, I found this effort to be among the most cloying, unoriginal pieces of pop-dance I've heard in years. After a month, I sold the CD on half.com 
 The material this book presents is very important for an engineer. The presentation of the material is very bad. It is very difficult for a student to follow. The mathematical equations are written in unaccaptable form. They are not even properly displayed. Proofs of equations and deriviation of equations do not follow an organized manner. This book is good for peaople that have prior knowledge of the material, and not for students 
 This is kind of an embarassment to Jay Ferguson. Why? It is a total sell out to just make money.  Jay was in Spirit and Jo Jo Gunne. These were cool groups. He is far from cool on this album (what a fruity looking picture on the cover. Nice hair do Jay!).  Setting that aside, Thunder Island was big in its time and totally reminiscent of the early 80's. Babylon is a re working of a far grittier Jo Jo Gunne tune. SOulin is ok  This is trying to cash in on the Jimmy Buffet vibe. But Jay was a legit rocker so it is hard to take seriously. Its like if Richie Blackmore sang in a barbershop quartet or Keith Moon sang Brill Building songs.  It is unnatural but definetly a guilty pleasure. Going from Run, run, run to Thunder Island...please 
 This book is a watered down version of the E-myth Revisited, which is a good book. The E-Myth Contactor - is a summary of M. Gerber's program with "contractor stories." There is no true insight into the contactor industry. My guess is this is the 1st of many books focusing on specific industries. My advice is to skip this book, just purchase Gerber's E-Myth Revisited & make the connections yourself 
 I liked Terry McMillan's "The Interruption of Everything", so I was really looking forward to reading this book- but it was one of the worst, most frustrating books I've ever read. First of all, the writing is on about a sixth-grade level. Example: "...Charles asked me if I wanted to dance. I said yes. So we danced. He danced like a man who was sure of himself. He watched me. I watched him. He smiled at me. I smiled at him." That's when I rolled my eyes and gave up. Unfortunately it was on page 365!! From then on I scanned the rest of the pages, just to satisfy my curiosity about what would happen to the rest of these characters. Secondly, most of the characters are complete morons, except for Gloria, who seemed real to me. (Working mom, single, trying to do the best for her son...) The other three jump into bed with EVERY man they meet, usually within the first three hours of meeting him. Then they whine and moan about how there are no good men out there. Well, DUH!!! Perhaps this is the point of the book, self-fufilling prophecy. I do like the title. It describes that feeling of waiting while what you want (husband, job, baby, etc.) hasn't happened yet. But this book was a disappointing waste of time. 
 MacKinlay Kantor's "Gettysburg" has been the finest introduction to the battle of Gettysburg written for young people for almost 50 years.  Unfortunaley, this paperback reprint only includes Kantor's prose.  The outstanding pen and ink illustrations from the  original Landmark edition by artist Donald McKay are not included.  I give Kantor's writting 5 stars.  But the current publisher's inability or unwillingness to secure the rights to McKay's illustrations earns a big fat 1 star 
 Ya know, when i heard that mobb deep signed to g-unit i was MORE suprised that 50 cent was ACTUALLY familiar with a group as great as Mobb Deep. I didn't even think 50 knew mobb deep existed let a lone that they were legends in new york. I mean i know 50's from nyc but think about it....new york IS one of the top 10 most populated cities in the WORLD. N-e-wayz....yo this CD is definately different from their earlier works on "hell on earth" and "the infamous" albums. But just because it's different doesn't mean that i'm impressed. Obviously, mobb deep is tired of rapping about things that are real where they grew up and they've given up by signing with 50 to make more money. I mean....it's all on their titles on the list of songs. Does this all mean that their sellouts? Well....considering i'm a mean critic of true underground hip hop music...I'm really not sure. Every artist/groups have different intentions. I mean...with a group as big as this...maybe theres a motive to their madness??? I'm trying to look at this from different points of views. Mobb Deep HAS been doing it a long time and all throughout the east coast and new york they ARE considered veterans of this game. Doing it since what...1993 right?? I honestly think that their trying to win brand new fans of the mainstream/commercial rap radio listeners. I think once they have new fans they will blow up and come back with the rawness that they had on the HELL ON EARTH album. We may have to wait until their 3rd album or so from G-unit. But hey, i could be wrong and maybe their just submitting their careers to 50, i dunno. Nonetheless....compared to their earlier releases this album is pure garbage. I agree with one of the kid reviewers that prodigy is trying to sound like 50. I suggest you just download or burn a few songs from this CD instead of buying the whole thing. There are no more than 5 good songs on this album. Oh yeah and the album gets better at the end. Too bad they wasted their songs as radio hit singles. Peace 
 I couldn't finish this book and I'm not sure if the problem is in the writing or in the editing.  At times the author seems to take these great leaps based on one or two anecdotes from his life and it is just not convincing.  There are some interesting details here and there but for me, it was just too rambling and all over the map.  
 I remember when I was in fifth grade, I snuck downstairs late at night to sneak a peek at the original Halloween when it was on HBO. I was mesmerized and scared to death at the same time. "The Shape," aka Michael Myers, was a chilling and oddly fascinating character. The sight of his shadow on the side of a building sent shivers up my spine.   I remember a scene that showed his silhouette against a house for a few seconds and the camera cut away as someone caught a glimpse of him. When the camera returned, he was gone. Little things like that scared me more than what little blood there was. Halloween sparked a number of imitators that added buckets of blood, but none of them had those little scary touches like the scene of "The Shape" against the wall.   So when Halloween: H20 was announced, I was at once a little skeptical but excited. Jamie Lee Curtis would reprise her role as Laurie Strode, the survivor of the first and second Halloween movies. H20 would be ignoring those sequels from 1982 to 1996, that had basically turned the storyline into another slasher epic, with the addition of psychic powers, strange secondary characters and a complete loss of focus on the true nature of what had made the original so powerful. With a lot to live up to, Halloween: H20 had the potential to disappoint as easily as it could return the series to greatness.   Unfortunately, the movie does not live up to the original. It barely matches up to 1981's unnecessary Halloween II. It tries very hard to be better than those other, now ignored, sequels, but it doesn't quite make it.   It's now 1998 and Laurie Strode has moved to Northern California to take a job as the head of a private school. She has a 17-year old son named John (Josh Harnett), who attends the school. Laurie and John have been battling the demons inside Laurie's head in different ways. Laurie copes through alcohol and John tries to keep her straight. It's beginning to take a huge toll on both of them, and something's got to give. A visit from Michael Myers, however, is not quite what they need -- but it's what they get.   I'll leave what little plot is left to the movie. If you decide to see it, you won't need to take notes to keep anything straight. It's as simple as slasher movie plots get, with plenty of false scares and predictable dialogue. The movie tries hard to be unique, even including appearances from L.L. Cool J, Adam Arkin and Janet Leigh (Jamie Lee Curtis' real life mom and Psycho star.)   However, director Steve Miner, who directed Friday the 13th Part II and Friday the 13th Part III, attempts to pay homage to the original by aping some of its best scenes. Only one, involving a closet, pays off. The rest are so blatantly lifted from the 1978 original, it gives the movie a by-the-numbers appearance, as if Miner expected to regain the greatest of the original by taking the best scenes from it. That's like attempting to retain a painting's originality by simply taking a picture of it. It may look good from far away, but up close it's going to be missing more than a few key elements.   If nothing else, Halloween H20 serves as an adequate final chapter in the splintered timeline of the Halloween series. That's about it. 
 I am a grea fan of rhapsody. The order of goodness of their cd would be this: Legendary Tales: Excelent Symphony of Enchanted Lands: Very Good Dawn of Victory: Good Rain of a Thousand FLames: Good Power of The Dragon Flame: Outstanding (Exelent +) Symphony of Enchanted Lands 2: Unbelivable (Exelent ++) Triumph of Agony:FU&^%*#%^#&$&$^( no vote  This is Rhapsody, this is not any mediocre bands. I could not tolerate those simple rhythms in most of the songs in which the elec guitar just plays two chors, the drums jus do a basic rhythm of bass, bass, snare like on punk music, the bass acompaniying this. where are the guitar solos of luca turili or keyboard solos that you coulf have found in any of the previous CDs. even Rin of the thousand flames is better than this one. On this CD I only recall two good tracks: 3, 11; 12 and 13 which are bonus tracks and which are very good by the way.  But still they are not as good the other CDs songs such as Emerald Sword, Unholy Warcry, Land of Immortals, Power Of The Dragonflame and other.   Oh my god. Track 10 is 16 minutes... OF REPEATING THE SAME MELODY. I remember on power of the dragon flame the song Gargoyles, Angels Of Darkness. that one lasted fo about 19 minutes, and in each sequence they would come up with something different. I got astounded about thet song. I really know how much these guy know about music.  They always have been so creative, powerful, knowledgable about music and so on. I believe they just realeased his CDs because they were on rush  I got the same desception with this CD like when Luca Turilli released    The Infinite Wonders of Creation and Lost Horizon, compared to the greatness of  King of the Nordic Twilight and Prophet of the Last Eclipse.  I apology in the name of the mighty warriors of rhapsod 
 This documentary reveals the shocking fact that companies, by law, have an obligation to their stockholders, rather than to society at large.  But this isn't the only case where 'people' by law are required to focus on only certain responsibilities.  What about doctors?  When a doctor treats you, by law that doctor is supposed to think only about what is best for you.  Shouldn't she really also be thinking about whether others would be better off if you were out of the way?  Shouldn't she give you an injection that would peacefully put you to sleep if she feels that society as a whole would be better off without you?    And what about accountants and lawyers?  Every time an accountant handles someone's money, he should be legally obligated to consider whether it would benefit society to take half of the person's life savings and give it to charity.  It's wildly inappropriate for your accountant to be legally obligated to handle your money in your interests.  What about the greater good?  And your lawyer should never act mainly for you - each and every lawyer should be expected to consider everyone equally, rather than giving special emphasis to her own client.  Let's get serious - in order for a corporation to act in the interests of its stockholders, who are the last in line in case of bankruptcy, it must first meet all obligations to others, or else there will be nothing left for those stockholders waiting at the end of the line.  As an ongoing business, companies have reason to care about their reputations, about earning loyalty from their employees, etc.  Yes, some companies have done bad things, just as some people have done bad things.  Can every single person be condemned as a psychopath, simply because there are some examples of humans that were considered psychopaths?    Corporations, like people, can do harmful, dangerous things.  There's no doubt that many of the problems documented here actually occurred.  But it is the reponsibility of government to regulate corporations, just as it regulates people.    The example of Bolivia, where people were forbidden from collecting rainwater, is an example of the failure of government.  Why would the government give such rights to anyone, even itself?  But when government regulation has been adequate, privatization of water and many other services has been hugely beneficial to the poor in most countries.  Demonizing corporations for faithfully managing the money invested in them is ridiculous.  Corporations, and individuals, should be regulated by governments.  If outrages are not detected and punished, then government has failed.  But we shouldn't abolish government, or corporations, or people, simply because none are perfect.  We should 1) hold governments accountable for performing their role; 2) hold corporations accountable for legal violations (through fines, and through sending corporate executives to jail in extreme cases, as has happened many, many times); and 3) use public pressure and our own personal buying decisions to give corporations an incentive to make socially responsible decisions.  If you really care about the poor around the world, then put the blame and the pressure where it belongs - on bad government 
 first, I didn't break a sweat, and I would consider myself an intermediate in the aerobic area.  second, the music is not music.  it's someone with a synthesizer hammering out a lame "latin-esqe" beat.  I was looking good some fun and inspiring latin music and well this is NOT it. It is sooooo cheesy.  This dvd *might* be good for the VERY early beginner or someone who's trying to learn english as a second language (the dvd is bilingual).  Other than that, I can't see much use 
   I just read this book, quite quickly in one afternoon. I think I've pretty much purchased and read every Danielle Steel book she's ever written as they used to be entertaining quick reads. I understand she has become an empire but must she also be a book writing factory. There is never much suprise as to how a DS book will end, the pleasure in reading them comes from the twist and turns,  historical and geographical research she puts into her books. This book reads more like a short story as many of her other recent books. Definately not worth the hardcover price.  Time to slow down and put out some quality work instead of quantity.  This book was fluffy & dull 
 Obviously written for an American readership, this book is specious, shallow and facile. Revealing little understanding of the times or context in which Machiavelli's works were completed, it is suitable only for those seeking a bastardised view of Machiavelli's thought 
 I'm very disappointed in the video quality of this DVD. I'm not sure how it was filmed, but when dancers move across the stage, they're blurry, as if there's not enough frames per second in the film. When the camera is focused on the main dancers, the picture is OK, but any movement that travels across the stage is a mess. Even a dancer being lifted starts out in focus, then the face blurs as the dancer is lifted up, then is in focus again at the top of the lift. This DVD is unwatchable for me. I think this may have originally been a TV production and that's where the problem with quality arose. I have several ballet DVD's and this is the only one so far with this problem. 
 This book is plainly boring in every way. The plot should be replaced and the character was completely and utterly uninteresting. The first half of the story deserved a whopping rating of negative 2 stars, and the second half deserved roughly one star. If you have any intention of reading a book that you will cherish in your heart, then I suggest that you would please disregard this novel and find one that is more interesting, like "Barney Goes to the Zoo". Do not, and I repeat: DO NOT read this book. If you would like to take interest in this novel, save your money and check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend. You WILL be disappointed 
 i ordered this release last week from amazon and couldn't wait to hear it, but when i got it yesterday, i opened up the cd and when the player read the info on the cd, instead of getting 15 tracks of music like i was promised, i got 10 tracks and 44 minutes of spanish ballads!  oh, my lord, what in the world happened!?  well, i guess you can't hear 'em all, can ya?  i'll just be sending this disc back to where it came from and just hope for the best next time.  oh, by the way, the one star is not for the flirts music, for that is 5 star material anyway, but just for the shoddy mishap that occurs when you get everything in its package except for the right music 
 This toy can't be unsed unless you go online and "update" it.  We have spent countless hours trying to "update" this toy - and ther is always a problem.  The website is down or some other technical problem.  Then IF the website is up - you go through the whole process and the toy still does not update - so it is unusable!  It is a complete waste of money 
 Hope Edelman's book is successfully part memoir and part academic study. She has chosen a narrow scope for her research, and that's fine--that is, until she feels the need to dismiss other related topics (such as the equally intimate bond between granddaughters and paternal grandmothers) by claiming that they are just not as significant instead of acknowledging that she simply did not choose to research them. The second hole in Edelman's research comes when she refers to how maternal grandmothers live longer than paternal ones--where the basis for this statement? I'll believe it when I see it. It's absolutely fine for her to choose to focus specifically on mother to mother to daughther generational relationships; what's not fine is for her to casually brush off related relationships as though they just don't matter as much. Within the context of her thesis, they are not as significant, but this is something that Edelman needs to address instead of pretending that she didn't write about them because they are not as significant. Other than these two crucial holes, Edelman's book holds merit in its well-written accounts of family, both from her own life and from her case studies. It's worth a read, not so much for its actual insights, but perhaps for the insight that it inspires its readers to pursue on their own 
 "And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?"   When I read the New Testament, I find a God of love and compassion. In these books I find a message of hate and fear. Why are so many eager to condemn those around them who don't believe exactly as you do? The history of early Christianity isn't one of a uniform understanding of Christ's message. If even those right after Christ couldn't get is right, why, on earth, do you believe that you understand the exact message of God? I would suggest we all work on bringing ourselves closer to God's love and spend less time imagining the punishment of those who don't conform to our idea of how God wants us to live 
 Why did they even bother transferring this movie to DVD?  Seriously?  The [...] child of a masterpiece, "The Vanishing" sports some of the most half-hearted performances and sometimes downright hilarious performances of the 90's.  This isn't a matter of comparison.  This movie, all by itself, just sucks. If I hadn't seen the original I'd just think, "what a brilliant plot, too bad they decided to bury it (no pun intended) with everything else in the movie". Jeff Bridges manages an unintentional bust a gut type performance as the sociopathic professor; his accent is so forced and ridiculous that one wonders occasionally if this a parody of that great, gut wrenchingly disturbing, Hitchcockian 1988 movie.  Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are themselves, which add nothing to the movie.   And the ending.  Oh, the ending.  We've been cheated.  Totally cheated.  All the power that this clunker might have had is torn away in a fervor of "It has to be upbeat!" Hollywood cornball syndrome.  Sandra Bullock is RESCUED, the villain is hit with a shovel, and everything is A-OK!  Even though Kiefer Sutherland's original girlfriend has been buried alive and suffocated.  This is [...]of a great movie.        
 The seams on the pillow are sharp and uncomfortable.  The extra pouches that supposedly provide additional support don't measure up.  THe snaps that should hold the ends together don't work.  Basically, it would be OK if it came with a soft cover 
 We returned this video camera due to video picture quality. The camera requires a lot of light to have a decent video, even after changing settings, the video had a "grainy" look. We just needed something basic to replace our 10 year old video camera and thought this would work, but the picture was worse than our previous camera. Purchased the PV-GS65, next model up with 3CCD's and love this model. As a matter a fact we still had the GS-31, used the same tape, shot the same footage, and reviewing the two different shots, the GS-65 did 100% better.   The camera has a great feel in your hand, although the menu button can be difficult to press 
 I must say I enjoyed the book, but the ending was so sudden, with so many things left hanging, that I was disappointed.  I wish one more chapter had been written to clear up- how did Manderly catch fire, what did they do when they got to the burning house, and how did they pick up their lives. All we had at the ending was ashes. Also, the narrator, who never gives her name, was sometimes very odd- hiding behind doors in her own home, sneaking food, hiding behind chairs. The book is worth reading, but I wish that, instead of spending so much time describing the trees and the sea, Du Maurier had written a better ending. 
 This is strictly a tourist rag. Don't waste your time. If your looking for a basic introduction to Voodoo, try Laennec Hurbon's Voodoo: Search for the Spirit; Voodoo & Hoodoo by Jim Haskins; Sallie Anne Glassman's Vodou Visions; Leah Gordon's Book of Vodou or even the Complete Idiots Guide to Voodoo 
 I read (or tried to read) the first six or seven stories in this book and wondered - these are the best horror and fantasy stories??  I was bored to tears by each of them, by authors who seem to have no idea how to inspire wonder in the mind of the reader.  As a writer of such genre fiction myself, I am offended and appalled that these stories were published anywhere, let alone selected for a best of anthology.  Ellen Datlow shows me time and time again that she knows nothing about editing fiction.  Bring back Robert Silverberg, Jack Vance, Sam Delany, Roger Zelasny, Fritz Leiber .... 
 I'm not into comics much nowdays, but I enjoy Scott McCloud's work, so I thought I'd give the "24 Hour Comics" a try.  I think I expected a larger format ... the art is cramped, the lettering sometimes hard to read.  For my tastes, the selection includes far too much horror and/or dispair. All in all, I'm disappointed in it.    
 In his book, The Rebirth of Nature: The Greening of Science and God, Rupert Sheldrake proposes some ideas about nature, the planet earth and the universe which at first look, sound interesting, but upon closer examination may seem somewhat far fetched. Many of his ideas are rooted in spiritual concepts, yet he also discusses science, its characteristics and its history.  Sheldrake attempts to link scientific concepts to his ideas, while at the same time showing disdain for the scientific way of thinking, which he terms "close minded." His ideas of "morphic fields" and "formative causation" are presented without  convincing evidence. At best he offers anecdotes to support his claims, which include: the idea that animals can communicate telepathically across time and space, and that crystals  influence each other through "morphic resonance." Reasonable people who have some knowledge of science will likely see there are less magical explanations for the phenomenon he discusses.  At the same time Sheldrake scolds the reader as "mystery intolerant" if unwilling to accept the author's assertions.  Sheldrake has purposely tried to blend science, which works through well thought out experiments to lead to the development of theories, and mysticism, which allows for leaps of faith to reach beliefs.  Some may find this combination refreshing, while others might view the juxtaposition of these two methods of understanding, as intrinsically incompatible.  Sheldrake's end goal seems to be to convince the reader of the great value of planet earth, and the importance of living in harmony with our environment.  Indeed, this concept is crucial to the future of humanity and all life.  Yet many will not need Sheldrake's extraordinary theories to lead to the recognition of this great truth 
 I've read a lot of P&P sequels and spin offs, from Bridget Jones Diary to the Fitzwilliam Darcy trilogy, but I never thought I would say that time travel and Jane Austen don't mix!  There are so many ways O'Rourke could have speculated why Austen never married, but this was NOT the way to do it.  The book has a promising beginning, with a modern New Yorker (Eliza) finding a letter from Jane Austen to "Darcy," which begins Eliza's quest to find out if the letter is real.  Unfortunately the time travel story interrupts what could have been a very promising tale 
 I haven't had much success with this ice cream maker.  I usually give up after 2 hours of churning, and the mixture is far from ice cream at that point.  I usually have to throw it all in my freezer to get it to solidify into something resembling ice cream.  I saw in another review that it has taken another user 2.5-4 hrs to make ice cream.  That's way too long...seems like the old hand crank ice cream maker my parents used to use was a lot quicker 
  	The author of A Northern Light is Jennifer Donnelly.  She resides in Brooklyn, N.Y, with her husband and daughter as well as two greyhounds.  Other works by  the author  include Humble Pie and The Tea Rose.  A Northern Light was the winner of The Carnegie Medal, The Los Angeles Times Prize and A Michael L. Printz Award Honor Book.   	The intended purpose of this book was to address many issues that young people face growing up.  The main character, Mattie Gokey, has to go through many hardships and make many adult decisions in this novel.  Mattie lives with her Pa and younger sisters.  Other characters that play a large role in this book are Weaver, Royal, Minnie, Miss Wilcox and Grace Brown.  A murder takes place in this book that was based upon real events.  Even though the murder was an actual event, the characters are made up to help it come clearer to readers.  Grace Brown's body is found in the lake after she takes a boat ride.   She gives Mattie a bundle of letters to burn but when she is found dead, instead of burning them, Mattie begins to read them and discovers many important aspects of the murder.  Donnelly skips back and forth from past to present and takes us through part of Mattie's life.  She also adds alot of advanced vocabulary for Mattie's words of the day.  She also uses language of the time period to make the story  come to life better.   	Although this novel received many awards of excellence and I'm sure alot of people would greatly enjoy  reading it, I was not one of them.  At the beginning, I thought it was going to be a very exciting murder mystery, but was disappointed to discover that the murder played only a small part in the whole novel.  I did find it very interesting though that it was actually based on a real murder.  I would probably not recommend this book for someone who is looking for a murder mystery because the murder only plays a small part in the novel.  Also, I think the author could have labeled the chapters a little more clearly because it got a little confusing with all the switching back and forth between past and present.   	I would say the intended audience would be young adults and most likely just females.  It contained some adult content, such as some profanity, as well as some sexual content.  Boys would probably not enjoy this novel because it is, in some aspects, a love story.  There's "sparking" and affairs and dirty older men at the hotel.  A younger person would not understand or want to read something that involves such material.   	In conclusion, A Northern Light was not one of my  favorite books that I've ever read.  The audience range is very  small and also based upon gender.  It is a well written novel, it just doesn't spark alot of interest in many people.  It went into to much detail at some parts and not enough for other parts.  I think she should have made the murder a more important part of the novel because it would have made it much more exciting.  
 light didnt turn off, mirror wouldnt stick on shower wall, and mirror became foggy! 
 I've owned this cookbook for years.  A well-meaning relative gave it to me when I first became a vegetarian 16 years ago, and it's a good thing that I didn't start to try recipes from this book early on, because I would have given up on vegetarianism.  There are some decent bread recipes here, but the remainder are almost uniformly terrible.  Nutritious, perhaps, but also tasteless without a seeming thought to presentation or texture.  This book represents the worst of early vegetarian cooking in America, and I have yet to prepare a single recipe from this book that I found to be truly appetizing, or that I would (heaven forbid) serve to guests.  I didn't sell my copy because I wouldn't inflict this sort of thing on an unsuspecting victim - I recycled my copy 
 I have read 10 Sheldon Novels and this was my least favorite. Kelly and Diane either are cats with 9 lives or those pursuing them are the most incompetent clowns in the underworld universe. Also, with there lives in constant danger there is a such thing called police to seek out help from. Oh yea, Diane tries this and the detective is transfered. That means he does not turn his case over to his replacement? Was he the only detective in NYC?  The other books I read had narrow escapes but the ones that Kelly and Diane get out of are so unrealistic that I found myself reading a comedy. I was waiting for "Angel" (Kelly's dog)to also be involved in the conspiracy also. (Heck, the rest of the characters in the book was including the person I bought it from at the store.  I hope the next Sheldon novel I read has a plot along with twist that are more plausable. 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 I've heard good things about this book so I was honestly expecting to like it.  However I really was disappointed and surprised because after the third chapter the book gets boring and very repetitive.  And because it was written by Brooke Shields, the book sold.  But really, if an unknown wrote this book it would not have gone anywhere.  I also got the feeling that because Brooke Shields suffered PPD, she thought it is was so almighty important that she needed to write a book about it.  I'm sorry but I don't think that a person who goes through depression for only a few months has suffered all that much.  There are unfortunately millions of people who are poor, without health insurance, and worse without support of family and friends, that keep their depression going on for years and years and their entire lives are destroyed by this illness.  No one cares about them.  That is the saddest fact about depression in this country.    However Brooke Shields had millions of dollars to pay for help, a famous name that allowed her to write a book all about it, a career that people would die for (her lack of talent doesn't seem to have affected her career much), and most importantly a husband and friends to help her out.  She also had a doctor calling her every day which I've never heard of before!  Try being without all those things when you're suffering depression.  Trying to beat depression without love and resources is like trying to drive a nail into a board with a feather.  I was a bit annoyed that Brooke Shields was oblivious to all this in her book.  And Tom Cruise only brought more attention to the book with his rant about medications.  I admire Tom Cruise - he is certainly far more talented than Brooke and I believe his comments about her career angered her more than anything.  However he is not a doctor and he does not know what he is talking about!!!!  The book's writing is very mediocre and the people who buy the book live under very different circumstances than the author, so it's hard to get much out of it.  This book only sold because it was about Brooke Shields 
 I read this book as a selection for my book club.  After all the fan fair, this book was a complete disappointment -- and let me tell you, we've read some bad books in the past.  This one takes the cake.  I can get past the fictional aspect of the book; however, the supposed "great writing" is just not there.  I found this book to be very superficial, although the story line had great promise. A considerable struggle to get through and little if any flow to the writing 
 i've read this book cover to cover several times and am mystified as to why it got so many good reviews.  much of the book is full of techniques anyone w common sense would use in teaching young children.  some of the ideas i have seen presented by other people at various conventions.  in all, it's ok, but do not ezpect anything earth shattering 
 First of all, I want to make this clear that the two stars I give to this title has nothing to do with the content of the book. It has everything to do with the Author's reading of this book!  I bought the CD version of this book and found that the Author's reading of the content of this book was not impressive at all. He delivered the speech in a dragging and delibrately slow fashion.    His voice was tense and unnatural. This gave me the feeling that he was not confident during the recording of this CD version in the studio.   I was greatly dissappointed with this CD version. He did not deliver as I would expect from an expert negotiator. I almost fall into a sleep 20 mins into listening his CD!  I thought "what happened to him? He does not speak like respectable negotiator. Why would an negotiator speak in such a boring & weak tone, almost dragging every single words he speaks. I wouldn't want to listen to a slow speaker. He bores me to death! I going to stop playing this CD!"  Believe me, I am not exegerating. I would advice you to buy his book. Save your money, don't buy the CD version! It's not worth it.  By contrast, Brian Tracy is more competent in this area. I have listened to Brian Tracy's Audio Book. You won't regret buying any  of his Audio CD; I can assure you!  His deliverance in the Audio books is commendable. He speaks with a clear voice, not too fast, not too slow, very natural and this reveals his self confidence.  He does not only read from scripts, he speaks from it. 
 This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end. For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?   ...And many more! 
 I can't believe this compilation.  I have most all these tracks from their albums or singles on various forms of media (tape, vinyl, CD) and I can't believe some the songs have "beeps" in them.  It's selective censoring, because you'll have songs like, "Black Steel In The Hour Of Chaos" and "Fight the Power", but then you'll have a less popular track like, "He Got Game" uncensored (in fact Chuck and co. use the F word more in that song, than probably any other song they've ever recorded).  So a big thumbs down for me.  I'd rather just rip all my favorite tracks onto my comp and recompile uncensored.  It just seems to go against what this group stands for with the inclusion of the beeps.  I'm sure somewhere along the way someone made a mistake, because it's just trivial that some are censored while others are not.  And yes, I made sure that I had a supposedly "uncensored" copy (i.e. not from Walmart).  Do yourself a favor and buy It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold us Back, Fear of a Black Planet, and Yo! Bum Rush the Show separately.  
 The book gives you the idea that if you can find a banker who can finance you, you can build an empire, regardless of who you are, and what type of a nation you have! 
 My twelve year old who read and loved the E. Nesbit book Five Children and It hated this movie.  I have also read the book, and the movie has very little in common with the original story.  There is no eccentric uncle and cousin Horace or secret door in the greenhouse.  The children are not sent to the country because of the war.  Even the wishes the children make are not true to the book.  My nine year old enjoyed the movie because she had not read the book.   So, although it is pleasant, clean, family entertainment, I think E. Nesbit would have been disappointed at the adaptation of her book.  It seems to me that the producers of this movie merely plagiarized E. Nesbit's idea of five children and a sand fairy and then totally wrote their own story borrowing from C.S. Lewis' Chronicle of Narnia series 
 I have been a huge fan of Michael Crichton for about 25 years.  However, this book is misleading and dangerous.  Almost every respectable scientist in the world now agrees that global warming is real and that we are greatly accelerating this problem (except some scientists affiliated with the petroleum and automobile industries).    Writing a book that disputes global warming would be like writing a book that disputes the holocaust - Mr. Crichton could just as easily have written a book about how the holocaust did not really happen, and provide plenty of "references" to support this premise.  Tragically, in the long term, global warming could be far more destructive than even the holocaust.    I hope that someday Mr. Crichton recognizes that, in addition to his enormous talent for entertaining, he has enormous influence on people's thoughts and actions through his books.  There is a quote: "With great power comes great responsibility."  But in this case it would seem: "With great power comes great profit at the expense of the planet. 
 nothing more frustrating than to find that the album o.s.t. doesn't contain all the songs that acompany a movie. in this case, it fails to offer one fantastic song: "in the deep", by bird york. you almost feel like you've been cheated 
 When the grill arrived, my husband put it together right away.  I am glad he did.  It was very unstable.  I would be afraid of cooking anything on it.  We packaged it back up and sent it right back 
 VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK.  NOT ENOUGH DETAIL FOR KIDS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PARTS OF THEIR BODY CAN NOT AND SHOULD NOT BE TOUCHED BY CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS; AND ALSO WHO CAN NOT AND  SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES TO TOUCH THEM.  THE BOOK WAS A WASTE OF MONEY.  WISH I COULD GET A  RFUND ON THE BOOK! 
 With White Chicks Keenan Ivory Wayans and the Wayans Clan have shown us they've lost touch with their cinematic roots and become totally disconnected from their viewing audience. Like Robert Townsend before him did with B.A.P.S., Mr.Wayans and his clan have made the film they parodied with relish twenty years ago in Hollywood Shuffle.  Shawn and Marlon Wayans are two bumbling FBI agents who screw up a drug bust. To redeem themselves, they take a case to stop some kidnappers. They go the airport to pick up two snooty rich heiresses and take them to the Hamptons. When a car accident leads to some minor facial injuries on the rich girls they insist on staying in a Manhattan hotel for corrective surgery. The guys go get made up and dress up as..White Chicks. That's what we're told. That's what they want us to believe. But only the Emperor in his new clothes would fall for that make-up. It doesn't even cover the actors in a lot of frames!  As soon as the movie heads into the Hamptons the plot falls apart and the movie enters the MST3K realm of stupidity. The only way anyone could find this "movie" funny is by making their own jokes and crass comments about all the plotholes and story inconsistencies. I'm not even going to finish synopsizing the plot because it makes my head hurt to think about it. I just want to know: How does anyone believe these two guys are women with their broad shoulders and those rubber Michael Jackson masks? How does anyone on a crowded beach not see Shawn Wayans casually walk into a ladies cabana a "White woman" and come out a well-dressed black man? And in the same sequence how does Marlon wear a low-rise bikini and not one of the women notices something isn't right? How does Shawn pass off another guys' house as his own when he doesn't know where anything is? There's suspension of disbelief, but come on, no one can stretch their disbelief that far.  Ugh. The acting here is HORRID. Any actor involved in this dreck should take this movie off their resume and never mention to anyone they participated in it. Ever. Shawn and Marlon aren't funny at all here. The weak gags have no-set up so the comedy duo's timing and execution are way off. Terry Crews hams it up as a basketball star with a fetish for one of the "White Chicks". Not his best work. Brittany Daniel looks better than she acts in this movie. The talented veteran Frankie Faison is the only one who manages to pull a decent performance out of this material. I don't remember most of the cast; the movie was so bad I want it erased from my long-term memory.  This movie isn't the Wayans family in top form. Even with all six Wayans doing screenwriting, the script is a mess not fit for a home video. It's clear the Wayans didn't have any understanding about what they're writing about. Did the family do any research before setting pen to paper? Did they consult any rich women while writing this parody? There are more things to make fun of about rich women than tasteless sex jokes and stereotype Valley girl gags from twenty years ago. The young jet set is different from city to city. What's hot with Paris and Nicole in L.A. is not cool in the Hamptons or Martha's Vineyard.  Watching this movie I wondered what happened to the Wayans family? Twenty years ago they were masters of satire and parody that tapped the Black cultural pulse. Hollywood Shuffle, I'm Gonna Get You Sucka, In Living Color, A Low Down Dirty Shame, the Wayans Brothers, and Waynehead were brilliant pieces of Black satire that showcased the tremendous talent the family had for humor. With this movie and Little Man it seems like they've lost their way.  Here's some advice to the Wayans clan: Pick Up Hollywood Shuffle, I'm Gonna Get You Sucka and A Low Down Dirty Shame. Go get the Old In Living Color tapes. Study these projects and pick apart the jokes. Take a trip back to the comedy clubs in New York. Talk to some people. Reconnect with the roots of your comedy. Take some time to craft a solid script and go back to doing the hilarious satires and parodies that made the family famous. This wacky Looney Tunes style of comedy you've been doing recently just doesn't work.  Pass this waste of celluloid by. Get the Wayans' early films listed above. Or Get Some Like it Hot, or Tootsie. Both those movies are million times funnier than this one. 
 From beginning to end, I found this book to be dreadful, and an utter waste of my time. Champion? Of what? She is the queen of making excuses, and really, isn't it too soon for an autobiography? Do yourself a favor, skip over this book 
 This is easily one of the worst written, worst researched, and worst argued books I have ever read.  In fact it is so bad it is laughable.  I do not agree with their views but this has nothing to do with this review.  Turn to the epilogue and read this statement: "For example, all prophecy scholars agree that the generation that saw Israel restored to her land in 1948 could well be the "generation [that] will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened" (Matthew 24:32-34, NIV)."  No one, not even LaHaye can actually believe that statement.  You can't get 10 people to agree on what to have for lunch, how in the world will you ever get people to agree on something as controversial as the interpretation of Bible prophecy.  Other things that had me in stitches was when they said that a past scholar believed there would be 50 years between the rapture and the tribulation.  They then go on to state that they are pretty sure he would change his mind if he were alive today.  That may be true but why even bring it up.  If that makes it in your book you surely must not have much to say.  Don't waste your time, money, or effort on this book.  I had never read any Left Behind or other LaHaye prophecy books.  From the outside in it sure seemed like it was a cash cow with little substance.  This absolutely proved to me that my assumption is probably true.  ****A Side Note**** For those commenting on reviews by partial preterists, you really have no idea what you are talking about.  I understand the futurist view.  I was taught it my whole life and in Bible college.  I have read books about it including this piece of drivel.  The least you can do is read something by DeMar or Gentry and learn what you are arguing against instead of making assumptions.  What has been written so far in the reviews really makes you look like you have no idea what you are talking about 
 I was scouting around for a new British crime series to start and heard good things about Peter Robinson. So, when I came across this second in the Inspector Banks series, it seemed like fate was telling me to dive in. However, I and my wife both found it a severely disappointing, utterly unimpressive procedural. I can only surmise the series gets better over subsequent volumes, because this is utterly average stuff.  Inspector Banks has recently relocated form London to sleepy rural Yorkshire and is still getting a feel for the lay of the land (following his first case in Gallows View). One day a retired historian turns up dead in a field near the village of Helmthorpe, leaving Banks with an old-fashioned whodunit. Pretty quickly, the stable of suspects is established: his widow (who inherits a nice legacy), his old friend and publisher, his mystery-writing drinking pal, his local GP and drinking pal, a local entrepreneur developer drinking pal, or the local folk singer he may have had a fling with a decade ago?   Like a latter-day Miss Marple, Banks and his plod underlings go back and forth from house to house, interviewing suspects and trying to tease a semblance of motive and opportunity from their statements. Of course, like the old-fashioned constructions of Christie, we are left with lots of semi-plausible motives and seemingly few opportunities. Banks is convinced the answer lies in a fateful summer ten years ago. Meanwhile, a local teenage girl brags about seeing something the night of the murder, placing herself in danger. Will Banks be able to get to the bottom of things before the killer strikes again?!?!?   It's all pretty bland stuff, and gimmick by which the murderer masks themselves is a bit of a groaner. The clues dovetail nicely, and Robinson's done a capable job of constructing a puzzler, but the story and characters are instantly forgettable. The writing is utterly without style or distinction and the Yorkshire setting never really came alive for me. It seemed a kind of generic green and pastoral land with insular people and cure stone cottages. All in all, very little to recommend here. 
 American Pastoral was repetitious to the Nth degree. I read the Human Stain a few years ago, and it was good.  But, in Pastoral, the reader is put through a zillion permutations of possible dialogs between the Swede and a psychoanalyst, and between his daughter Merry and a psychoanalyst, but absent the psychoanalyst: Roth is our psychoanalyst. What he misses, however, is that we simply have to realize that interpersonal dynamics are sometimes beyond our control. The Swede never failed as a father; rather, he failed because he couldn't let go of his sense of responsibility for her 
 I purchased this DVD, and could not get it to play in my DVD player.  I sent it back for exchange, and received another identical disk that it too would not play.  I sent it back for a refund, and was never able to view it.  I never thought to try it in my computer, bur realize now that could have been the compatibility issue. Oddly, the DVD has the symbol on it that it should work in any and all DVD players in the US.. 
  The book is manipulative and unrealistic. I felt the author was blatantly trying to persuade the reader to believe that infieldey, betrayal and lack of morals is acceptable if you have a self absorbed best friend.  Definitely one of the shallowest books I have ever read.  I bought the book as it was rated as a "best seller" , and I was stuck in an airport for hours on end. The entire plot is hideous as the "burned best friend" makes up reasons why it's accept able to betray her best friend. If I was not completely bored, I would have given up on the book after the first 20 pages. 
 I ordered this book through a bookclub and returned it.  It was terrible!  Tanya Holland is a beautiful Black woman, but I feel has gone too far out of the way to create "innovative and different" recipes so much that they are not appealing and certainly should not be categorized as soul food.  The price is outrageous for the handful of recipes that were chosen for this cookbook.  I collect african american/soul food cookbooks among others.  If you are really into soul food cookbooks and what they really represent, your money would be better spent on "Essence Brings you Great Cooking" by Jonell Nash, "The Ebony Cookbook" by Freida DeKnight or "The Black Family Reunion Cookbook" by the The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in healthier soul food try, "The New Ebony Cookbook" by Charlotte Lyons or "The Family Dinner Quilt Cookbook" by The National Council of Negro Women.  If you are interested in diverse, cultural flavors, I would recommend Vertamae Grosvenor's cookbooks or "Iron Pots and Wooden Spoons" by Jessica B. Harris.  I have collected over 50 african american soul food cookbooks.  They cover the gamut.  That is why I can give an honest opinion on Tanya Holland's book.  I just wish that she would publish an african american cookbook that the average African American can relate to.  One that would be useful to families in their everyday cooking.  
 The Sierras are much nicer when visited in person. Reading about the natural wonders found there isn't the same as actually checking them out for yourself. Perhaps if you were already familiar with the areas Mr. Muir traversed, and wish to brush up un them or revisit them literarily when unable to do so physically... THEN perhaps this book would be better 
 this film was funded by the centeral intelligence agency in the 1950s and was maipulated to suit the need of a capitalistic propoganda machin 
 With each book she writes, Jodi Picoult comes down a level in terms of quality.  Rather than narrowing the scope and developing it well, this novel is a pinball machine of ideas, people and issues that never come together.  I kept holding out for an ending that would redeem the rest of the story but was disappointed till the final word 
 Who is fear mongering for political advantage now?  Let's try another more accurate introduction...  As the self-appointed savior of the planet, a perfectly PC and sinless Kennedy flies into Houston (burning Jet Fuel refined in the completely legal plant he sees below).  He purses his lips because he is upset that refining energy for the country requires emissions.  He is so pleased that he and his liberal brethren have been able to consume all the same things Texans enjoy - plastic, gasoline, natural gas, and electricity, in massive quantities and then leave their collective share of the pollution in Texas.  "Yuk!  That does not look anything like Martha's Vineyard where I romped in the surf with a silver spoon in my mouth!" he exclaims.  How dare those southern red-necks build a state more economically powerful than mine!  What is wrong with this idiot?  Did he just discover that we have refineries in Texas?  These plants are operating completely within the law, and have been doing so for decades, under both Democratic and Republican administrations.  They are vital to the economy and without them we would all starve and/or freeze in the dark!  If liberal Yankees like Kennedy are offended by the Houston Ship Channel I suggest that they stop using the products that come out of Texas.  In fact, any state that does not allow refining and drilling for oil and gas, onshore and offshore, should not be allowed to the use of any product derived from hydrocarbons.  Any other course of action is pure hypocrisy --- Liberals all want what the petroleum industry provides, they just can't stand Texas oil men.  This is industrial and regional bigotry and is obviously designed to scare people into voting the Dems back into power 
 This book was a reading for my 3rd grade daughter.  I have no idea how or why this book EVER won an award, unless it was for being the most boring yet deppressing book ever written.  And the illustrations were just as sad 
 FOrget it. I am an ivy league grad who had a hard time following this book. It is bland and boring. And so complicated--who has time to follow all  of it. What a waste of money 
 While I did find the book informative and a good supplement to Robert Sobel's The Great Bull Market: Wall Street in the 1920s, Galbraith interjects his sarcastic view of the participants in the 1920s Bull Market way too much. This makes parts of the book extremely difficult to read. While I persevered to the end, I fouynd Sobel's account as informative and much more enjoyable to read 
 Our daughter bought this coffee maker. We had trouble with it from the start. It leaked water from the base and made a huge mess wherever we put it. She was so disappointed, and so were we. 
 I purchased the Peg Perego Aria stroller last month for my 3rd son.  Needless to say, I have lots of experience in the stroller world.  This was my first Peg Perego stroller purchase as I have used Graco and Maclaren in the past.  I had been using my Maclaren umbrella stroller (which I purchased in 2000 when my first son was 6 months old) and thought I would buy a new stroller since the other was a bit old.  My girlfriend recommended the Aria so I purchased it.  Anyways, it was a huge disappointment.  The steering is AWFUL.  You definately need TWO hands for this stroller.   The stroller is also extrememly "wobbly".  I was shocked as I figured such an "upscale" brand would be quality enough not to wobble so much.  The 5 point restraint is hard to stay in place as the back straps are attached into a little "envelope" type holder but it always comes out as there is no device to actually secure it in place.  It is bulky in that it doesn't fold into a small compact stroller.  I used this 3 times and just gave it away...what a waste of $$. I'm back to using my Maclaren, which looks thrashed but is a wonderful stroller.  I could kick myself for wasting the money.  My advice to you is TEST it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely on the name 
 I have derived many hours of pleasure from this author. My favorite is Ivanhoe. I wouldn't recommend this one, though. It is boring and confusing 
 after get shorty, e.l. might just wish shamelessly that his next book with those same chili palmer characters might hit the goldmine and pay dirt and being bought up by the dumb hollywood producers and made into another movie again, with this single-minded purpose focused, e.l. wrote this totally unnecessary sequel to get shorty. and he was right again, it was bought and made into a movie again, but pathetically, a horrible one compared to get shorty. the novel itself was also a complete failure with so many obvious evidences that e.l. indeed wrote it in a way for another movie in mind. i simply failed to find there's any interest in reading this going nowhere story. it just like reading a double imaged e.l. personified in chili palmer and lobbying so hard to make this novel into a movie, with all the bore-to-death script, dialogue readymade for hollywood to grap. how could you imagine that those winnos in los angeles, especially those who in the hiphop music biz would watch 'charlie rose' and would have known and recognized chili palmer as the producer of 'get shorty'? you think those people would faithfully turned on their tv and channel surfed to pbs to watch 'charlie rose'? and at every corner of los angeles, every table in any restaurant, almost everyone would recognize 'chili palmer'? and you have to ask yourself: since when people would recognize a behind-the-screen movie producer, even a director in person? even they stand in front of you and claim themselves they are? yeah, maybe elmore leonard would watch 'charlie rose' regularly? and you think that charlie rose would interview a notorious shylock in his show? give me a break! this book, from the 1st page to the last was an absolutely no-brainer, so shallow and so superficious! just a total unnecessary and unwanted cash-in 
 I'm a huge u2 fan but maybe I'm the only one on this world who doesn't like r.e.m. very much.I find songs like drive,everybody hurts and man on the moon(one of my favourite)very beautiful.But the other songs are boring and ripetitive.I don't know why people say that this is one of the best album in music.I hope one day I'll understand this band.. 
 I know this is supposed to be one of the best novels of the 20th century, but. to put it simply,I found it to be unreadable although I tried several times 
 A disappointing book about a fabulous story.  The book reads as if it was pasted together from press cuttings and, if you look at the chapter notes, this appears to be how it was researched.  There are little irritants, such as referring to Steve Jobs as "Steve" as if he's a close friend, but the big problem is that it recounts a number of interesting incidents in Steve Jobs' career while missing the main story.  And what a fantastic story that is.  I hope that someone has written a decent account of Steve Jobs' life because I would like to read it.    One thing is certain: "iCon" sure ain't it. 
 I have been interested in improving my performance for years, and finally decided to take the plunge and look into heart-rate monitoring. This book does not really support a specific philosophy and who knows if the so called "science" is supportable. I also read "Heart Monitor Training for the Compleat Idiot" by John L. Parker and recommend it. It appears much more scientific and emphasizes recovery over training in a zone. Don't buy this book.  Rory Donaldson roryd@brainsarefun.co 
 Most of Catherine Coulter's stories are good. Not The Target. This one starts off with the main character, a judge, deciding to secretly keep and care for a kidnapped child he found in the woods. He can't stand the idea of anyone else trying to care for her - including her parents. His reasoning is frightening, to the point that I wished he would have been arrested for his illegal acts, including kidnapping and washing down a rape victim. Sorry, Catherine. This one was really off Target.  
 That which is original in this program is biased and untrue. That which is true is not original. This piece of environmental and liberal hyperventilation steals liberally from true scholarship, such as "Rats, Lice, and History" by Hans Zinsser. It makes obvious observations in such a self congratulatory style as to be nauseating. Diamond's on camera mugging and fake shows of emotion are hideous. National Geographic has sunk to new lows to screen this 
 Unfortunately, there seemed to be no recourse after I ordered this for 2 newphews as a Christmas gift, and it did not arrive.  I tried to send an email to amazon.com but got bumped to someone else (distributor?) who never responded.  So disappointing since it was a gift for someone else.  Happened not once, but twice 
 The wrong item was sent. There are 2 items with the same title. Advances in Economic Theory I and Advances in the Economic Theory II. The description of the book was very vague and I was unaware of the existence of two version up until I received it 
 First, the good news:  1. I lost 8 pounds in two weeks on this diet, even with the occasional skim latte and granola bar.  2. Following it wasn't logistically impossible, as some have complained. Even as very busy grad students, my roommate and I were able to stick to it by making meals in advance and marking off on a daily list the things we were supposed to eat or drink throughout the day.  3. I really liked the cranberry water, and still make it when cranberries are in season. I'm not much of a water drinker, but enjoy guzzling the cranberry water, so it helps me stay hydrated and cleansed.  Now the bad news: 1. I gained back all 8 pounds and more within the weeks following the diet, even though I eat little junk food. 2. No noticable reduction in cellulite while I was on the plan. 3. I frequently felt hungry or experienced cravings (hence the skim lattes and granola bars mentioned above). I was having fantasies of buying a loaf of crusty bread at my favorite bakery and tearing into it the minute I got into my car. Definitely not a good sign. 4. As with all diets, food and body became an obsession. Finally, two things that made this experience somewhat worthwhile: 1. I learned about cranberry water. 2. It brought me a step closer to leaving the insane world of dieting. That was three years ago. I'm not and don't ever expect to be a size 8 like I wanted at that time, but I have no regrets. 
 Castro et al. are to Cuban history what Comrade Stalin and company were to Russian history and Joseph Goebbels and friends were to German history.  The title by itself is laughable.  Who, except for Castro cultists, really thinks that the U.S. military could not have beaten Castro's forces if it had been given the go ahead to do so?  As it was, the defeat of a force of less than 1500 Cuban exiles left stranded by the U.S. on Cuban soil is really a testament to President Kennedy's poor judgement rather than to Communist Cuba's military prowess.  For a truly balanced, historical account of the Bay of Pigs affair, read Peter Wyden's "Bay of Pigs: The Untold Story."  Then, for a study in propagandizing and myth-making, read this book 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 I was happy with the sleek look - but unfortunately it's kind of cheap-O. The vertical rods that keep the paper towel in place are loose and bending - and really no way to tighten! Nice looking until you use it, then kind of cheesy.  The quest for a decent paper-towel holder continues, I'm afraid. 
 I'd loved all the other Jack Ryan stories I'd read (though I hadn't read all of them).  This was a little too coarse and nowhere near as good as the earlier ones 
 This is a strange little book.  The intention is good, love conquers all, dealing with aging, etc...  However,it is full of negative images, and frankly is...creepy.  When the boy is awake, he is exasperating, annoying, foul mouthed, and strange.  The only time the mother shows her love is by furtively entering her son's room and singing her little love ditty.  For what it's worth, my wife hates it too and refers to it as "The stalking story."  It has been unceremoniously pitched out of our house.  If you want a better rendition of this sort of thing, try The Runaway Bunny, or Guess How Much I Love You 
 I rented this DVD because of the glowing reviews here and because I wanted a better understanding of the origin of the modern problems in the Middle East. Overall, I was disappointed by this offering because it didn't give sufficient background and seemed to speak primarily to those who already had a knowledge of the subject. (It also seems to me to be *a bit* biased in Israel's favor vis-a-vis the Palestinians, but that flaw could be accepted and filtered appropriately.)  For instance, the documentary jumps right into the last Zionist Congress in 1939 (or whenever it was), but they never define what the Zionist movement is or where it came from. I know some of this from my reading, but it would be nice to have a summary here -- especially as it relates to the main players in the rest of the documentary. I wish the documentary would have at least started with WWI and the British occupation of Palestine after the fall of the Ottoman Empire, rather than picking up at WWII and mentioning some of the WWI details later. Doing so would have answered questions like, "Why are the British so important here?"  Another example is keeping track of the people, places, and organizations, which are often named in Hebrew or Arabic and are unfamiliar to the uninitiated. It made the sequence of events hard to follow because we had a hard time keeping track of who was doing what and where. Using more text on the screen, more maps, more recaps, and perhaps more English translations would have improved things greatly, methinks.  The film certainly has value, not least because it is told by a participant and first-hand observer, but it is not for those without much familiarity with the people, places, and issues at hand 
 I found the book "A Gathering of Days" interesting and filled with small pieces of history, but it was hard to comprehend and hard to read. The format of the book, journal entries written by a young girl, is neat, but her usage of out-dated words is odd and it takes time to grasp her meaning. Although this book was directed to a younger audience, I believe that older kids would better understand the phrases and words used. If you are interested in reading and seeing for yourself how life was and how people spoke in the 1800's, this book is perfect. The story was sweet and descriptive, but in my opinion, it is a one-time around book, and did not leave a huge impact on me. 
 I have been reading the Anita books and loved it ever since Guilty Pleasures. That is why I'm thoroughly disappointed with this book. I'm halfway through the book already and still there's not even a hint of a big bad. After the scene at the club, it's like 200 pages of repetative sex scene nonsense. I found myself glossing through paragraphs just to get to the end of the chapter. It feels like LKH ran out of things to write and stretched a scene into 5 chapters. I mean the curing Gregory part was just wayyyyyy tooooooo loooonnngggg... If the remaining books are like this, I think I'm going to pass it. AND Anita is getting to be so annoying. Whatever happened to her raising the dead or her police work or hell does she even works at her office anymore 
 If you have had any exposure to good literature, you will find this novel nearly insufferable. The symbolism is cliche, narrative style predictable and unoriginal, and the book as a whole is this woman's self-indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read. If she had any creative ability, she could use her family history as a starting point, but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh. Dull, dry, predicatable, callow, and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an English student 
 Beginning in 1984 in a series of articles, Richard P. Saller, joined a bit later by his ally Brent D. Shaw, mistakenly contended that the ancient Romans married late - males on average at age twenty-eight, females at nineteen.  They cited hundreds of Latin epitaphs from the late Republic into the Christian empire which proved beyond reasonable doubt that fathers normally commemorated their sons who died before age twenty-eight and their daughters who died before age nineteen; after those ages spouses became the predominant commemorators of each other.  From this solid base they erroneously concluded that those were the average ages of marriage.  Although otherwise erudite, much of Saller's Patriarchy, Property and Death is based on these miscalculations. His corollary about marriage ages, upon which most all of his other conclusions were based, was deduced from a faulty axiom. That is, he claimed that the patria potestas was really rather insignificant because most Romans married for the first time after the deaths of their fathers.  In fact very, very few of the specific references collected to date corroborate such a late age for first marriage.    Regardless, the text has been praised to the skies in numerous reviews and gained a seemingly widespread acceptance, most notably in Debating Roman Demography (Brill, 2001), authored in part and edited by Walter Scheidel, the dean of Roman demography, and containing a long article by Shaw.  No one has yet seriously criticized this gross mistake 
 While the Margaret Rutherford portrayals as Miss Marple were highly enjoyable, with welcome splashes of humor, the Geraldine McEwan portrayals are better compared with those by Joan Hickson.  It would be difficult to top Joan Hickson as Miss Marple, and Geraldine McEwan's performances, while credible and enjoyable, aren't nearly as good.  The best aspects of the Acorn Media versions of Miss Marple mysteries are the careful attention to detail in scenery, props, etc.  The interiors of the rooms, seem to be nearly perfection for the period.  The casting was well done as well, and the characters are realistic.  To me, the greatest disappointments in the Acorn Media films are the unnecessary and offensive inclusion of lesbiansism.  The ending of one of the mysteries was even inexcusably changed such that the two people involved with the crimes are lesbians instead of man and a woman.  Without the morally offensive aspects of these films, I would have rated them with at least three, possibly four stars.  Without the wonderful attention to detail in the settings, my rating would have been one star.  Geraldine McEwan is a fine actress.  I'm disappointed that she lowered herself to appear in these versions of Miss Marple mysteries 
 I started to read it.  I tried and tried, but in the end I gave it up.  Maybe I don't have the "intellectual equipment" to understand this book, or most of the other fraudulent tripe of that era.  I felt ashamed of myself for a while - until I found this gem in the Penguin edition of Somerset Maugham's "The Summing up" (page 60):  "It is strange that one can ever have admired that prose.  It does not flow.  There is no air in it.  A careful mosaic constructed by someone without great technical skill to decorate the walls of a station dining room.  Pater's attitude towards the life around him, cloistered, faintly supercilious, gentlemanly, donnish in short, repels me.  Art should be appreciated with passion and violence, not with a tepid, deprecating elegance that fears the censoriousness of a common-room.  But Walter Pater was a feeble creature: it is unnecessary to condemn him with intensity."  Alright, I'm a philistine for not enjoying "Marius", but I can take some comfort in being in excellent company. 
 This book was not of any help to me. It mentions all the aspects of business you need to be familiar with before starting one of your own, but it does not give any help on any of these aspects.  For example in financing your startup, it mentions geting a loan and using your credit cards. Honestly if thats the way to finance a business then you can add going on a diet and saving your lunch money. It goes on giving you mostly unintelligent information and advice like "buy a computer", "save rent, work from home". Put your money on another book and save yourself the trouble of reading it 
 A generally uninspired album - at times it sounds as if Jewel is simply phoning her performance in. Her voice isn't powerful, and when the orchestra gets loud she simply gets drowned. The better tracks are definately those where the production is kept to a minimum (Rudolph, I Wonder). In a few others (O Little Town, Go Tell it on the Mountain) her voice gets unpleasantly thin, which I found distracting.  Overall this is a forgettable set; personally, I really wasn't moved in a Christmasy sort of way. If you're a Jewel fan it's maybe worthwhile but other folks will find that there are better holiday albums available 
 Some reviewers rave about the content of this book, I don't know why.  It presents all of its topics at such a highlevel it's almost useless.  The authors of this book try to fill some kind of weird intermediate state between a digital logic course and a processor implementation course and fail miserably.  The book has not enough detail for either.    The cd-rom, faithfully following the trend of academic textbooks in the US for the past decade, is also completely useless.  The most notable things on the cd-rom are: several sections and a chapter from the book, not included in the text, in pdf, and, wait for it... the SPIM mips emulator.  Wow, now that is some valuable content [/sarcasm].  Any textbook that doesn't provide answers to the exercise problems deservers a zero in my opinion.  I would've given this book a zero, amazon wouldn't let me.  You may be wondering, did I have this book in a course?  Did I fail, is that why I'm so bitter?  No, I made an A actually, but I sure didn't learn much from this book 
 I became interested in this book in the hope that it would provide a novel historical perspective to what the title had promised. Unfortunately, the book turned out to be a mediocre history of the rise and decline of Islam as a dominant political power. The book does not bring a fresh insight and rates rather unimpressively relative to other studies on the same subject. Much better reading (and deeper scholarship) on the subject is readily available even to the non-professional reader interested in Islamic history. Some of that literature is cited in the book but only as terse roadsigns which the reader can only glimpse at in passing through the hasty narrative of the book. Unfortunately, therefore, the book cannot aspire to a being a qualified critique of past and present scholarship and points of view, either. Even the casual reader of history would know that Islamic expansion--call it imperialism, if you like--was not particularly different from the rise of other major historical powers, in the West and the East, all of which, at some level, could be justifiably identified as imperialistic. Why the choice of this title then? One wonders if the title is chosen as a free ride, a catch phrase, on the increasing (sadly mostly negative) popular focus on Islam and Islamic history on the tide of recent crises. This small book does not deliver either as a history of Islam or a history of imperialism. Consequently, it is neither here nor there. Better scholarship is available on both subjects. Polemic cannot be taken seriously 
 My first big surprise was the Overture.  It's the trucated overture used on the 1949 original cast recording, not the one used in the theatre and most subsequent recordings of "South Pacific."  If you want a short stereo version of "South Pacific," this is the album for you.  No dance break in "Bloody Mary," no chorus interlude in "Honey Bun," no reprises.    Florence Henderson uses two voices -- show and operetta -- and switches mid-song in a number of instances.  It's jarring and doesn't work well in establishing the character of Nellie.  Bottom line: With so many other "South Pacifics" from which to choose, this "new" CD falls close to the bottom of the list.  The Mary Martin/Ezio Pinza version, short but definitively sung, is the best. It's mono, sounds like it was recorded over 55 years ago, but is still magnificent and the recent remastering only adds to its majesty.  The 2-CD JAY recording is the most complete and gloriously performed.  The recent Carnegie Hall version has Brian Stokes Mitchell's epic "This Nearly Was Mime." The bottom of the list is reserved for the TV version with Glenn Close.  
 I was pretty disappointed in this book.  It wasn't as funny as I thought it would be.  I was looking forward to hearing about these 24 dates, but most of the book is just Jack being a whiner.  I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, however, it never did.  I thought most of the characters were flat too.  
 I'm an Angelina Jolie fan and had hoped to learn a lot about her by reading this biography.  I was seriously disappointed.  I didn't learn much, as well as the book was not well written.  I felt like half the book was dedicated to reviewing her movies or telling more about the movie plots, which I don't care about.  I wanted to learn more about Angelina Jolie as a person, and frankly, this book didn't teach me much.  It was a waste of my time to read 
 I bought this book in hopes it would be as good as the chicken soup books, it wasn't!   This book gave 2nd grade advice on relationships.  It was a waste of money. Stick with the chicken soup for the soul books, if you want  stories and not the advice of the author 
 This set of CD's never arrived. They must have been delivered to the wrong address. So I am disappointed to never have heard them 
 I saw this show on one of the education channels on TV and ordered it on Amazon. They indicated they had plenty of new and used DVD's in stock. DO NOT BELIEVE IT!! I have ordered and cancelled several times and it's been over a year and still nothing. Save your time and money and record it when it comes back on TV. Its the only way to get it 
 All for One is a poor man's Boyz II Men. They are second-rate and derivative. They aren't original and very bland with their material. Their singing doesn't help matters either, sounding like wounded mice on the edge  of death 
 I ordered this book after being put on bedrest for pre-term labor and found the chapter on this subject to be anything BUT encouraging.  The author makes it sound like pre-term labor is a death sentence for your unborn baby because of the experience she had, and according to her, there is virtually no hope of having a baby anywhere near term if you have this condition.  There are other subjects in the book such as Gestational Diabetes, PIH, etc, which are less drear, and I'm sure they are of help to women experiencing these conditions, but as a whole, I was disappointed with this book.  After several chances, I stopped reading this book because of it's bleak outlook on a common pregnancy complication 
 I hate to say this, but Child ripped the main structure of the plot, as well as the precise ending, from, of all things, an episode of KNIGHT RIDER titled 'Dangerous Maneuvers' from the fall of 1982. Everything is there: the army brats bonded together by accident,the love interest being not entirely white, the MPs dealing in crooked merchandise,one of the MPs being the father of one of the two main characters...but the weirdest part is the climax...I was sitting there in a state of shock, gasping at the tv,since right in front of me was the ending of The Enemy. Maybe it isn't exactly identical, but it's so close it's really strange...You won't believe it at first. I didn't. This was just yesterday too! The Sleuth network... Then I remembered that Child worked in TV for many years.  By the way, except for the baby face and easy smile, Hasselhoff would make a credible Reacher, he's about the right size. Too young, of course.  Anyway, it was very creepy.  It could be coincidence, but I doubt it. The climax is almost an identical scene. Yet I don't think it would be legally plagiarism, since there are dissimilarities as well. Interesting to think about. 
 According to the NIMH there are about 1.6 million cases _total_.  If the rest of this book is as accurate as that statistic then, well, that pretty much says it all 
 I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else 
 While De Zengotita's ideas are all fine, his writing style is much too convoluted and very often it's difficult to figure out what he is trying to say.  He jumps around a lot and it seems as if he's rambling too much and that there isn't much organization to the book.  I did learn a lot from his ideas, which I thought were great, but his writing was quite terrible 
 You went to the Family Values tour, what a poser!!  Thrash fans aren't sociopathic devil worshipers.  I'm a devout atheist and I'm not seen as a sociopath among my friends.  Infact, many of my metal brethren are very nice people and devout Christians.  You nu-metal (not "alt" as you want it to be) kids are just pathetic wiggers who have no potential in life.  Many thrash fans might abuse alcohol, but they're way higher on the ladder than you nu-metal kids.  Plus, your statement about thrash/death metal bands being "xerox" copies of each other is asinine; listen to Dream Theater's "Images and Words," Death's "Sounds of Persiverance," and Slayer's "Reign in Blood;" I dare you to say they have the same "formula."  And metal bands do evolve, if you say every album in Death's and Morbid Angel's discography sounds the same, you should jump off the Sears Tower.  There's way more thrash/death metal fans out there than you think, just because REAL metal isn't mainstream doesn't mean its a joke.  Oh yeah, among normal people, us metalheads have way more respect than you Korn Kidz, as we don't hang out behind liquor stores wearing ICP shirts, talking to each other in Ebonics, and passing each other a bottle of Thunderbird wine complaining about how our lives suck.  Before you criticize us metalheads, look at yourself, you retarded mallcore kid.  Now to this, not even Korn's "best" songs are any good.  This album isn't necessary because if you heard one Korn song, you've heard them all.  This is a big waste of money, if you want greatest hits albums, get Megadeth's greatest hits album along with Steve Vai's 
 I've struggled through 150 pages and I'm giving up.  I'm a huge fan of Arthurian versions, and this one falls flat and far short of other versions.  It is a pale pale imitation of the Mists of Avalaon. It drags in Guenevere as a follower of the old religion (pre-christian), yet does a poor job (so far) of describing it.  All the characters seem like villians, and Guenevere garners no sympathy. She spends most of her flushing with embarrasement! Much better stories are Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, even if it isn't well written, I still care about the characters.  Frank Whyte's Dream of Eagles series (8 books) gives a wonderful accounting of how Camalot grew into being, showing the co-existance of the old religions and how christianity came to the forefront. Its full of military battles that I prefer to skip over, but at least the battles make sense compared to this Guenevere tripe!  I'm very disappointed that I wasted my money buying this Guenevere series. 
 As a student starting law school I thought that this book would give me an advantage in my legal research and writing class, boy was  wrong... The book is full of useful information but none that realy pertains to law student. It is however, very basic in its approach and gives you a good start, so it is not a total waste.., The subtitle says that the book is for "non-lawyers", as if somewhere out there is a person who is not a lawyer and finds legal research fun. my recomendation is, that if you want a brief explanation of legal research and how to do it so that you are not totaly lost when you start law school this is a good book, but if you need it for some legal purpose and you are not a law student call a lawyer, trust me it is well worth the fees. Among the books flaws is that it tells you where to go to get the information but neglects to tell you that the resources they list, in the case of Lexis-Nexis and West Law require very expensive memberships and that most Law Schools restrict the use of their Law Library to students in their Law School and do not even allow students from the affiliated university to use the Law Library, as the Law Students in attendence at the law school require all of the resources of the Library and Legal Librarian ad nauseum and outsiders are most unwelcome.    
 Since 1980 I have tried in vain (and hard) to really like this band. Although Starz are comprised of competent players, their songs are simply bogawful! Sorry, it's as simple as this. (Two star rating for the nice guitar sound 
 Nothing special and probably over-priced for what it is. The leather is nigh on invisible.   It's more of a skin to protect the camera from scratches, "case" would be stretching the definition somewhat 
 This book is nicely illustrated, but you will be frustrated if you try to prepare for your examination based on this book. reaction mechanisms are not there, the details are scarce, and important points are too often omitted. only suitable for those who will only do one biochemistry course 
 You could write this book yourself - all  you have to do is spend a half hour thinking about all the different kinds of boundaries that exist between people. It's just a grocery list. Anne Katherine's only contribution is some anecdotes purportedly drawn from her clinical experience. The book cleverly leaves you with the impression that you've been given some advice, but the advice is missing.  Check it out 
 isn't wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a 21st century version of Al Jolson? the problem with so many new-traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience. hippies and white liberals love it, but where does that leave those that are living it? far better capturing the Latina experience are Julietta Venegas, south of the border, and east LA's Lysa Flores, north of the border 
 The liner notes of this CD state that it was mastered in 1999, so there really is no excuse for it sounding as bad as it does; in fact the LP I have containing some of these songs sounds much better, and it is over 20 years old.  Unfortunately, this is the only thorough compilation of Davis' tunes.  It would be hard to believe that original master tapes were used as the source for this project.  It sounds as though they taped the songs off the radio back in the 80's, and then used a 20-year-old-cassette as the source.  It's sonically muted and in some cases there seems to be a subtle oscillating of the pitch of certain tracks.  Perhaps the engineers really wanted to get an authentic  "warm" 70's/80's sound, but it just doesn't do his voice or songs any justice 
       !!!!!!!!!!DONT BUY!!!!  NUFF SAI 
 I agree completely with Dr. Chorbajian.  I purchased this book in preparation for a graduate level criminal profiling class and have been thoroughly disappointed with both the quality of the writing and the depth (or lack thereof) of discussion.  The authors may be experts in their field, but you wouldn't know it from this book.  Unless you're forced to buy this book for school, opt for something else 
 While I will say that the illastrations were lovely, and the text paints a very cute picture of a stuborn yet cute toddler, I have to say that this book was put up high on a shelf and will not be read again any time soon.  WHY?  Because throughout the book, Ella Sarah gets her way by being consistantly disobedient to her parents and older sibling, and throws (in my opinion) a temper tantrum to get her way! but in the end her BAD behavior is considered "CUTE" because after all, its more important to express your individuality.    During the reading of this book to my toddler, I had to repeatedly stop and explain to him that he should never act in this way and he is much more likely to get his way by simply asking permission than by making rude demands, throwing his toys, and talking back to get his way.    It is very disappointing that a book like this received an acclaimed childrens literature award. The behavior that is portrayed and treated as acceptable (while it may be cute to Grandma) is not behavior I believe most parents would truly tolerate from their toddler.    
 An album of anodyne wallpaper-drivel: hypermanufactured in every worst sense. Fine, there's nothing wrong with the songs; it's just that all colour has been cloyingly bleached out of them. Tempi are uniformly slow, accompaniments, saccharine-coated, and the lyrics so indulgently mauled as to render them ironically sterile. What persuaded first-class musicians like Stephen Schwartz to have anything to do with this tedious project? Even the booklet looks like a second-rate ad promotion for a hotel chain. 'In Good Company?' Frankly, I'd rather be in on my own 
 I am troubled by the deep levels of victim consciousness in this book.  How sad that Adrienne Rich, given the gift of three children, could remember little of the experience "except anxiety, physical weariness, anger, self blame, boredom and divisions within myself."  I feel pity not only for Rich but for the millions of women who suffer similar experiences and see no options other than checking out with depression or acting out through rage, both of which are counterproductive and generally treated with pharmaceutical drugs.  Clearly it's time for more empowering alternatives, starting with nutrition.  As a Clinical Nutritionist, I have seen many depressed and/or angry women dramatically improve their physical and mental health by giving up junk foods and so-called "health foods"in favor of  traditional foods rich in protein and fat. In other words, we must assert our right to eat the life-giving whole food gifts from Mother Nature, not the fractionated, packaged and dead food-like products built by Father Technology.  Although nutrition is but the first step, it will take well-fed women to tap into victor consciousness and to find creative ways to overcome the crippling obstacles, long-standing abuses and  self-destructive patterns that continue to incapacitate so many gifted women.        
 This was my first Deaver book...and my last.  The suspense factor was "ok", but the sections on scuba were ridiculous.  A diver (with only 25 logged Caribbean clear-water dives) goes into a new NY/NJ wreck, alone (no dive buddy), on a single tank.  And the Coast Guard approves this dive...laughable.  Then once in the wreck, the diver goes down a dumbwaiter passageway measuring 2' by 2', without taking off any gear!!!    You might ask why I point this out...The above was 2 chapters, not just some passing reference, a very material piece of the story.  If this one section [which I know something about] is that outlandish, what does that say for the other sections that I'm not as informed about.  Complete Science Fiction!!!  You are better off reading tea leaves than this book. 
 It is difficult to believe Huxley was almost seventy and a highly regarded novelist when he wrote this piece of adolescent rubbish. It is also difficult to believe that so many reviewers think his ideas here are new and interesting. Well, I suppose they weren't so clichéd when he wrote them, but they certainly look very tired now.  The first couple of chapters are actually very good, as we are gradually introduced to the protagonist, Will Farnaby, finding himself shipwrecked on an island and encountering its inhabitants. His confusion and his obsessive thoughts about his failed relationships are very well portrayed. Unfortunately, after this the book degenerates into a very boring talk-fest, with a minimal plot that surfaces from time to time before coming to a fairly predictable end.  Island is, so we are told, Huxley's idea of utopia, but from a modern perspective, it looks more like a very idealistic view of a hippie commune: free love, child-sharing and family planning via sexual yoga, all under the benevolent influence of consciousness-expanding drugs. It's difficult to believe  he really believed it could work, but the whole thing is explored without a hint of sarcasm, and Will is so convinced by it all that he undergoes a total conversion experience.  The last chapter is well-written, apart from the flat ending, but Huxley had lost me long before then.  I disapprove of a writer using his novel as an excuse for preaching. I do believe that novels should have themes, and the more serious the theme the better, and I know that it is sometimes difficult to locate the precise line between thematic concerns and preaching - but this book is clearly way over the line. 
 Getting high, getting drunk, wasting money on material goods, and basically being a whore is what this book is all about.  This girl is straight up nasty and described in detail about all of her sexual encounters: Kool G Rap, Ja Rule, Ice T, "Papa", Ray J, Irv Gotti, Bobby Brown, DMX, Diddy-Squat, Dr. Dre, Jay Z, Shaq, Vin Diesel, Xzibit, Usher, numerous male clients, and FRED DURST? Karrine was so grateful to be in one of Jay-Z's videos, she thanked him  by showing him why her nickname is "Superhead." Supposedly Magic Johnson was just a friend who helped her when she needed it- with no strings attached- but come on! Something was going on.    You would think the breaking point for Karrine would be when she lost her condo and was homeless, living in a car with her son. She talked about how no one cared about her and she had to take control of her life. I'm still not sure how she did it because once she got back on her feet again, she was off drinking, drugging, and whoring again. Still mingling with the people who she claimed did not care about her.   In the introduction Karrine states this book is to warn girls about the dangers of being a video hoe and the she's not proud of what she's done and that if she could she would go back and change things. HOWEVER, in the epilogue she then states she still "enjoys an exciting lifestyle with celebrity colleagues, friends, and lovers" and that she would live her life over again.  So in other words, she's still a hoe which is quite evident from the front book cover and the photos inside the book. On the back cover she looks like she's highed up on something.   There was nothing uplifting or motivational about this book at all. I did, however,  learn how to be a hoe in the entertainment industry: 1) Work at a strip club 2) meet athletes/celebrities 3) have them pass me around 4)  be biggest whore I can be and 5) just stay away from drugs and alcohol. This book is just another way for her to rake in some more cash to continue living her lush lifestlye which will quickly fade into oblivion like the careers of most rappers. No wonder Usher dissed her. Even Rick James would've dissed her 
 Don't fall for this. The authors are conservative propagandists who engage in the kind of fake scholarship that the American Enterprise Institute and its ilk specializes in. Remember when you were first learning to write a term paper and the teacher said "don't make the facts fit your argument; your argument has to rest on the facts"? Well the authors were busy running for class president and missed that little lesson. In their world, there is no reason to worry about discrimination laws, or social security, or poverty relief because no-one is ever destitute, excluded or unable to get decent work. Anyone with a passing acquaintance with reality can recognise this for the class warfare that it really is 
 This book has a lot of information most of which is useless calculus integration with vary brief summery which seems to me being derived from other books just thrown into the mix with general categories. The book is basically an oversized machinery's handbook but with a poorly written index and with a lot of inapt formulas that don't have a explanation for formula variables used in the equation.  If you do a lot of strength of material design I would suggest a machinery's hand book, or the McGraw Hill Mechanical Engineering Design book which is an excellent P.E. exam reference book. Stay away from the Roarks Formulas for stress & strain book its more poorly written then the Marks 
 To begin with, on page 59 the author describes unripe ears of corn - in Europe in the year 1315 (!!!). Where was his editor? (Corn was unknown in Europe until brought from America in 16th century.)  Pros: does provide some historical context to the 14th century plague pandemic. Also mentions other pandemics.  Cons: there are many. Mr. Kelly's writing style is less than perfect. He annoyingly repeats passages without adding any new content. Instead of a spiral, this creates a circular narrative wasting reader's time. It seems, the author does not have enough material to elaborate on his statements.  The author's "scientific" arguments also seem very inconsistent and vague. Sometimes he lists opinions different from his own, but in the end just notes that they are all incorrect. Because I cannot judge his knowledge of genetics (see prior review), I assumed that he relayed the most accepted theory of pandemic's origin. Apparently, that may not be the case either.  Almost every chapter dealing with plague events in a particular city/region is concluded with the phrase "thus the mortality rate can be estimated to be unprecedented 50%". Why "unprecedented" if he claims it happened in so many localities? Another example. Talking about cities in Italy and France the author likes to repeat that despite humongous loss of life "the civil order generally held". Then, talking about epidemic in England, he concedes that in England order held much better than elsewhere. Again - just the statement, no details, no comparisons, no facts.  I have other complains as well, but I'll stop here. 
 Although this book provided a lot of information about self injury, I felt that it was more geared towards doctors/therapists than to people who hurt themselves.  I found it very technical and a little impersonal.  It offered  so many different possible explanation for self injury that all it actually  ended up saying was that no one really knows why people deliberately hurt  themselves.  I also didn't like the way it referred to self injury as  "self mutilation" throughout the book.  It is too harsh a term,  and not one that sufferers like to use or hear.  Overall, the book gives  much information about self injury, some of it very scientific, but it is  not the best choice if you are a person who hurts yourself 
 When Britney Spear's first album came out called Oops! I Did It Again, I thought she had talent. But when My Perogative came out, I'm like, "Where she at? That's sooo NOT BRITNEY SPEARS!!" I couldn't believe it!! And her music videos from the CD, uggh!! I want da REAL Britney back!!! 
 With all due respect to Richard Carpenter, this collection is a disappointment. I have a very high end audio system. If he was going to remix these songs, why not get rid of all of the excess and artificial sounding reverb and clean up the vocal tracks? Why not try to create an intimate in your room sound instead of the same old, tired, re-packaged sound. The SACD track only helps alittle. The vocals still sound edgy and grainy to me and since the original tracks were analog, this was in the mix or the mastering. Next time, go for a cleaner, more intimate sound, not the same stuff we've already heard countless times 
 Babyface sued singer Anita Baker for allegedly failing to pay him for a song he produced for her. He filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit against fellow R&B artist Anita Baker alleging she owes him at least $250,000. Babyface co-wrote and produced the incredible song "Like You Used to Do,".   It's kinda hard to beleive this, but it seems Anita decided to con her producer even if the album went gold with 500,000 sold copies. I purchased this CD because I had heard about this duet with Babyface and "Like You Used to Do" is the best track on the album. 
 Both Rayovac and Energizer are selling rechargeable NiMH D-cell batteries that have the exact same power rating as their NiMH AA batteries.  Also, Energizer customer relations reports that their Alkaline Energizer Max D cell batteries have about 8x the power rating as these NiMH rechargeables (20,500 mAh versus 2,500 mAh).  Even the Juice rechargeable NiMH D-cell's have nearly three times the power compared to these batteries (7,000 mAh versus 2,500).  I guess it's "let the buyer beware"... 
 I can't believe I just spent over an hour of my life listening to ten (TEN!!) different mixes of this not too remarkable dance hit. By the third version, my brain turned to jelly. By the fifth, I needed a drink. By the final re-mixed version, my hangover already started to set in. This e.p. is for DJ's and masochists only. 			- Tom Rya 
 I've heard many of the term before. Zoomburb. Big Box. Alligator. I guess that's what happens when you grow up in the house of an engineer. I figured this illustrated guide would be interesting to look at, so I picked it up. The pictures were only satisfactory, and some of the writing was above my head. I did learn lots of new terms though. However, I don't think I would recommend this unless you have some interest in land-use, urban planning, or architecture 
 This is a gorgeous book. It is beautifully produced, has stylish photographs, and the author writes gracefully and eloquently about food. I immediately fell in love with it, I was attracted to the concept of improvisational cooking, and I couldn't wait to try out the recipes.  So far, however, they have been a real disappointment. The rustic root vegetable soup tasted like dishwater; the improvisational meat loaf without ground beef was anemic and unappetizing; the raspberry cake was heavy and flavorless (I consider myself a fairly experienced baker, and virtually all the cakes I make from Nigella Lawson's recipes, for example, turn out fine). Even the "chocolate wonders", aka "the best cookies I've ever had", were at best a B+ (the others so far have been a C 
 Don't bother wasting your time with this movie, instead read the book.  The book was one of the best I have ever read, the movie left me wanting.  I rented the movie after reading the book and never made it all the way through.  So maybe I am being unfair since I did not watch the whole movie, but honestly I couldn't, it just didn't do the story justice 
 Although there seems to be some validity to a number of Mr. Carrol's arguments, he has taken the easy road on most subjects.  As an example of his approach; Modern Medicine's chemical approach can be proven incorrect by one of the most common treatments.  Headaches are not inherently caused by a lack of tylenol (Excedrine etc.) in your dietary intake and therefore cannot "cure" your headaches(Despite the fact they may render you asymptomatic temporarily).  If the body gets an infection we take an NSAID to lower our temperature which in turn allows these organisms to live longer at their preferred temperature, therefore medical approaches should be looked at as unscientific by nature.?? Despite the truth to those very common approaches in modern medicine, we don't disregard or walk sideways into our doctor's office.  Quid pro quo Mr. Carrol, books looking at the negative side of any issue are fairly easy to scribe, a devil's advocate follow-up would be a nice factual read on most of your subjects. Dr. Michael Peterson   (PhD) 
 This book is not only unremittingly malicious in tone, but well known as being inaccurate, sloppily put together, and a book whose author clearly had an agenda in depicting Paley as some kind of monster of evil. A bad book that leaves you feeling bad.    
 I've been cutting myself since I was 14, now I'm 24. I'm currently writing my own book about self-injury and personally I felt this book was boring. I pushed myself to continue to read it and by the end of the book it ended up being just another book on my shelf.  I wouldn't recommend this book to people, self-injurers or non-self-injurers.  I believe the stories that were told within the book had a lot of the same storyline. I would've liked to have read different types of stories. The majority of the stories were about those who were abused. Not every self-injurer was abused. Some just had troubling pasts like myself that weren't able to cope with life.

 John Ashcroft has written a book detailing his job as attorney general for president George W. Bush's first term.   The title, 'Never Again' refers to his feelings for the political bent he brought to the position whereby he was as much an extension of the White House as any other administration appointee. The title also refers to his reaction to the 9/11 attacks -after the attacks he determined that commercial air travel was too dangerous for the top law enforcement official in the land, in this case, 'Never Again' refers to taking DOJ jets for all transportation -so at least he could be safe.  It may also reference his atempts to help the administration blame everyone but themselves for the attacks, irrespective of the fact that the president was warned on Aug. 6 2001; George Tenet, J. Cofer Black and separately, Ricard Clarke tried to warn the administration what could possibly happen as a result of terrorist attacks in this country 
    Diamond spends twenty one laughable pages on male lactation.  What's next?  How about implanting a uterus?  After all, men are stronger and could probably carry babies better.    Big game hunting by the males of indigenous tribes was probably more effective when there was more game.  But, for Diamond, it leaves the question open as to "What are men good for?"      My question is "What is Jared Diamond good for?" 
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 Could anyone tell me where's the plot of this book? In the first pages of the book you'll know who shut Andy and why, so the rest of the book is worthless because you know the truth and the police doesn't. How could this be a thriller? The book's plot could be written in 25 pages or less 
 I read this a few years back, but I still remember it well for being the first book I couldn't bring myself to finish. I read about 100 pages, which took me over a month, after which I sat down and pondered whether the plot or characters actually justified going on reading. The book had its moments, but I found it to lack direction.  The language is absolutely excruciating. Some sentences are almost a page long, and just littered with commas, parentheses, strange use of colons, or all of the above. Often a sentence could begin with a story of something, then trailing off to a sub-story of that item, then trailing off to a sub-sub-story of the sub-story before going back to the sub-story, maybe to another sub-sub-story and back to the sub-story, and finally back again to the story where the sentence started. When you constantly have to go back half a page to remind yourself how the damn sentence STARTED, it's more frustrating than fun to read. I suppose Faulkner was going for some stream-of-consciousness approach, which I can safely say is not my cup of Scotch.  I should point out that I am an experienced reader and that I read it in my native tongue. Maybe the translator did a hack job, I have no idea. I only know it was a thoroughly painful read and I felt relieved to ditch it and move on. A book is NOT well written just because it's "difficult".  Of course, he won the Nobel prize, so what do I know 
 No truth to any of it.  Sickeningly manipulative.  Pure trite Hollywood garbage.  I never write negative reviews but shame on these people.  The only laugh I got was at the film's expense during the horrendous now notorious butterfly scene.  A complete insult to the intelligence of the American filmgoer (or any other nation for that matter).   
 I was excited to read this book, and then  I read the first paragraph. This book is a horrible bore. But I have been forced to read it for summer reading. If your not required to read this book, Don't. 
 I found this book completely useless except for a paperweight or doorstop!  What I did find interesting is that Vickie Adkins-Marcum seems to review all of Matthew Lesko's books.  Of course Vickie highly exalts him using such phrases as "KUDOS to Matthew Lesko! He's making this world a better place!"  For those of you who are a little slow, let me inform you that Vickie Adkins-Marcum is really Matthew Lesko, or someone Matthew gave this review to and paid Vickie to post it.  It's strange that Vickie's reviews all start out with the same first paragraph and have many of the same phrases throughout.  It is also strange that Vickie only reviews Matthew's books.  Shame on you Matthew Lesko for writing your own review 
  Apparently, this is a film that many women, who have read the book, can make enjoyable.   Characters, including Anne & the Captain, display wooden acting. Poker-faces. Others speak at a clipped pace. The properness of the times allowed for personality, as shown well in "Pride & Prejudice" 1996 & 2006, but not here. Shyness, plainness, or slowness, may be portrayed likeably, with some personality.   Both Anne & the Captain maintain wide-eyed, desperate, looks, constantly. Many of us do get nervous within romance; but we are compelled, by conversation, and activity, to interrupt our nervousness with personality. Thus, Anne's & the Captain's constant, wide-eyed, nervousness is un-natural. All of us at the age of Anne and the Captain, would have refined our nervousness to be responses of: shyness, thought, distance, hopefulness, approval, or alarm.   You understand the quiet thoughts, because of the story, in spite of the confusing, paralyzed, looks; rather than because of them. You come to like Anne and the Captain toward the end, in spite of the wooden acting, because of the story's ending.  This film has pretty scenery; such as walks along the ocean. The costumes are often very unique and well done. There is beautiful singing in one scene, and even better, wonderful singing over the closing credits.   Good period, romance films are so few, and so desired, that many women labor to imagine this film better than it is. I applaud their positive imaginations. However, they continued their fanciful, wishful, thoughts into rating this film. A reviewer, who liked the film, says she had read the book, and she cites a huge amount of important background from the book that is not shown in the film. A poor script for those who have not read the book. Awful directing made awful acting.   I would like to see this good story re-made by a better Director.   Well-made romance films are: "Pride & Prejudice", "Wives & Daughters", "North & South". Fairly made is "Under the Greenwood Tree" 
 I found myself after reading the book. Sincerely hoping the movie will have a different spin. This is an unsatisfying sequel to the novel Get Shorty. I love Elmore Lenord novels but this is a dud 
 I was very happy with my purchase.  The company chose to mail it to me via priority mail in order for it to arrive before Christmas.  I was very pleased!!!!   
 if you lose this cord just get a flash card reader. It's cheaper and more practical 
 Sorry for the sarcasm, but I can't help thinking just how uninspired this book is.  Imagine a counter to this book.  This book would promote "hate", "dishonesty", "immorality", "ignorance, "ingratitude".... you get the picture.  This Mormon leader's great contribution to world is to say we should be honest?  Now that was profound!  Sadly, Gordo and his wrinkled cadre have this bad habit of taking the basic decency of the members of the church and attributing it to the implausible myths they peddle to the world.   As an avowed atheist, I encourage everyone to be honest, moral, learned, and all the things Gordo promotes in this book.  There is nothing wrong with promoting these and they have nothing to do with Mormonism.  But this book is written for children and sheep.  Promoting this book among the various books that seriously discuss morality, ethics and other serious issues is like watching a high school team play the New England Patriots or comparing a Janice Kapp Perry vapid song to Bach's Mass in B minor.    Mormonism is declining in real terms because their leadership does not have the capacity to address and provide any illumination to the relevant issues of the 21st century.  This book should confine itself to the children's section or to the local Deseret Book store.   
 First of all, I want to make this clear that the two stars I give to this title has nothing to do with the content of the book. It has everything to do with the Author's reading of this book!  I bought the CD version of this book and found that the Author's reading of the content of this book was not impressive at all. He delivered the speech in a dragging and delibrately slow fashion.    His voice was tense and unnatural. This gave me the feeling that he was not confident during the recording of this CD version in the studio.   I was greatly dissappointed with this CD version. He did not deliver as I would expect from an expert negotiator. I almost fall into a sleep 20 mins into listening his CD!  I thought "what happened to him? He does not speak like respectable negotiator. Why would an negotiator speak in such a boring & weak tone, almost dragging every single words he speaks. I wouldn't want to listen to a slow speaker. He bores me to death! I going to stop playing this CD!"  Believe me, I am not exegerating. I would advice you to buy his book. Save your money, don't buy the CD version! It's not worth it.  By contrast, Brian Tracy is more competent in this area. I have listened to Brian Tracy's Audio Book. You won't regret buying any  of his Audio CD; I can assure you!  His deliverance in the Audio books is commendable. He speaks with a clear voice, not too fast, not too slow, very natural and this reveals his self confidence.  He does not only read from scripts, he speaks from it. 
 I received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my Canon Rebel XT Camera.  Followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail.  It appears that this remote is defective 
 This book is not what I thought I bought.  I was expecting information useful to left handers.  Instead I found out why society belives left-handers are evil and research on how left handers are formed.  I  enjoyed reading the encylopedia more than this book.  By the way, it was  written by a right-handed person 
 This latest translation of the Chinese Taoist Classic is a dry and lifeless specimen, not surprising from a man whose translation of the I Ching was praised for "having no truck with 'timeless wisdom.'" (back cover blurb).  This volume's claim to fame, beyond its slim and attractive appearance, is the complete translation of Wang Bi, a 23 year old commentator from 3rd century CE China.  To determine whether this translation is for you, you should know that Wang Bi had a strong inclination toward political interpretation, a proclivity probably due to the "high official status and prestige" of his family and their role in government and politics [p. 9], a trend furthered by his great-uncle's "Treatise on Keeping One's Person Safe"-which begins by making government secure [p. 10].  (Now there's a Chinese virtue, eh?)  Consider also Wang Bi's answer as to why Confucius never spoke of nothingness while Lao Tzu spoke of it incessantly (as the Mother of the Ten Thousand Things etc.):  "The Sage [Confucius] embodied nothingness so he also knew that it could not be explained in words....Master Lao...constantly discussed nothingness...for what he said about it always fell short [p. 12]."   Now if you believe that someone who could say that actually knew anything firsthand about the Tao, then this book is for you.  And if you are interested in Wang Bi, see Ellen Chen's superb translation/commentary which puts it in perspective.  Otherwise, this is a book on Te-social virtue-where the scholarship is impeccable and the feeling is weak.  And that's the Way it is 
 I truly enjoyed "His Majesty's Dragon", the first book of the series.  I eagery started the second book, and ended up forcing myself to have to finish the book.  I will agree with most observations that the development of Tereraire is very good in this book.  Unfortunately, it seems that the author forgot about the main human character in the book, Laurence.  The problem is, is that Laurence started out as a Captain of a Royal Navy Ship, and served for more than three years, yet for all of that, his character appeared to be as green as a raw recruit in everything in this book except the single fight scene.  I felt that he was immature and had almost no common sense in this book, which is completely at odds with his character in the first book.  True, this is more of a diplomatic area than wartime, and I could forgive a little uncertainty on his part, yet it just seemed like less thought was put into his character development than in Temeraire's 
 I bought one of these about 3 days ago and it's already broken. I try to charge my ipaq1940 with the suggested tip and the adapter begins to continually reset my PDA. Not only that, but it drains rather than charges the battery. This is an extremely overpriced piece of junk, you'd be better off taking the large amount of money you would invest buying this product and consolidating whatever various devices you're trying to charge into one smart phone/pda/whatever that does everything you want 
 I honestly admit I did not finish this book.  The topics jump from one to the next with no focus. The author reminded me of my worst profs in college; a self proclaimed genius with NO ability to write or communicate.  
 I would like to clear up some confusion regarding the use of the terms "illusion" and "delusion," which Freud himself distinguishes early in this book.  A "delusion" is something that is believed that is not true.  An "illusion" is something that might be true or false, but that is believed because we want to believe it. Religion is then regarded as the fullfillment of infantile wishes, implying that it is something we outgrow.  But Freud has admitted by his choice of terminology that religion might be true.  As to the question of Freud's atheism, the book cites, as I recall, evidence of both a Protestant pastor, and admirer of Freud, who considered him an atheist and a relative who said whatever else he was, he was not an atheist.  Freud does not attempt to resolve that difference, as he so easily could have. I know of no evidence anywhere in Freud's writings that he ever committed himself to atheism, at least, if "atheism" is defined as denying the existence of God.  (Broader definitions are possible.)  I conclude that Freud's underlying disposition is not so much atheistic as irreligious.  I say "underlying disposition," but I could just as well say  "bias" or "prejudice."  Now let us consider what that disposition, which never is proven, but which is clearly manifested, implies.  Since no justification is offered in any rational manner, we must look for a pattern in what is said.  A rubric that covers not only everything in this book, but perhaps everything he wrote, is "illusion."  Perhaps that was Freud's Freudian sloppy slip.  For his irrational bias against religion can easily be explained as an infantile wish that religion, by which he would have probably thought of the Jewish faith and the Christian faith as they were represented in Vienna at the time, were not true.  He didn't want them to be true.    A further consideration is that in this book Freud gives no evidence whatsoever of having investigated,  or even being familiar with, the evidence and the reasoning of those who defend their own religious belief or the demonstrable proclivity of the human race to believe and practice or feel guilty about their failure to practice, some religion.  In this he is just an intellectual of his time, a time dominated by materialistic determinism in the name of science.  I agree with those who regard Freud as a great writer.  His prose carries the reader right along, until the absurdity of the ideas makes you want to throw up.  I first read Freud at the age of 22, ploughing my way through "The Interpretation of Dreams."  Even then I could see that he was subjecting all his empirical, i.e. clinical, evidence into the framework of a system of subjective categories, which at the very least were dubious.    Freud's scientific pretensions were an attempt, unconscious perhaps, to give prestige to his new ideas.  At the time science was riding high.  Marx, also, for instance, regarded his ideas as scientific.  And I do not mean to imply that Freud was not a good observer, nor that he was dishonest, just deluded by his illusions.  He founded a very influential cult, that has lasted until our own day, although it has never gained anything resembling general scientific acceptance.  Several of his earliest colleagues broke with him, the most important being Jung and Adler.  That is typical of cults, which cannot bear the weight of more than one dominant personality 
 Why would anyone bother to read this when there is the lonely planet guide available? This is in my opinion a vastly inferior guide when compared not just to lonely planet but to many of the others available, it lacks  organisation and detail 
 I did not like the first book at all and not sure why I read the second, I guess that I am just stubborn that way.  I really enjoyed the concept of following Robert the Bruce through his consolidation of power.  The Scottish Monarchy is a fascinating story and one in which I have ordered a history book about to read the whole story.  What I didn't like about this book was that the battle between good and evil was too simplistic.  When situations got bad for Bruce or the Templars there was no real action or plot to save them, the Templars just prayed about it and some divine intervention would take care of the problem. I simply didn't like the fact that it was that easy.  I guess that I was looking for more drama or action from the divine forces.  A demon in rings doing mans bidding in a war against the Templars (I would have thought the church as a whole would have been a better target for this concept).  The Templar order falling apart from within was interesting and maybe I don't know enough about their real history to appreciate their treatment in this work.  This was not my favorite piece of historical fiction 
 This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.    I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).  The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.  I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire 
 Esler as a fellow human being was not accessible to me as I read the book, though I truly wanted to warm up to him. For one who stresses an I-You approach to interpersonal relations, he sure didn't treat the authors with whom he interacted in his texts as "Yous".  And he sure didn't present himself as an authentic human being who makes himself vulnerably available to his reader. He seemed to me to be very dismissive of other scholars and authors. I know he wasn't writing for devotional purposes, but I was still disappointed with the lack of an uplifting and edifying character to the book. But if you want to read someone swimming with the current of modernity-bashing and smug anti-evangelicalism, here is your man.  I suppose I had hoped for more New Testament and more theology than Esler provides 
 If people want to read a book that is more objective about this case please read, "Unplugged, Reclaiming Our Right to Die in America" by William Colby.  Mr. Colby is the lawyer for Nancy Cruzan, a case very similar to Terri Schiavo's, so he is very knowledgable about this topic.  He does not denigrate either family and approaches the subject of dying very even-handedly.  Reading either the book by  Michael Schiavo or the book by the Schindlers is an exercise in futility to me.  Both sides have their own opinion of what happened and are obviously very biased to their own point of view. This is a very dysfunctional family that will never agree with anything the other says simply because they do not like each other, and readers should understand this when they read their books. In between all this name-calling and accusations lies the real truth, as it usually does, and no one, especially the public, knows that real truth.  This is a case that should have never been so highly publicized, it just brought out the kooks and all those people who like to hear and see themselves proselytize on TV (including politicians) These difficult decisions are quietly made every day in this country (since the Quinlan and Cruzan cases) without any fanfare and this case should have been no different. And anyone who thinks "starving" Terri could cause the massive brain damage seen on autopsy is just plain stupid.    Anyway, don't bother with this book or any of the other family-versions unless you want reinforced what you already believe is the truth......read something that is unbiased, objective, and neutral.      
 I was a bit dismayed with Hook's book because in reality it just reiterates the cliche'd notions we all have about gender and gender relationships.  Bell attempts to influence readers to adopt miandrists beliefs, albeit she does so subtly.  Males do have emotions although perhaps we often don't see that, and Hook's insensitivity to the male gender is subtle, but still ubiquidous throughout the book.  I cannot reccomend this book because like many modern works that attempt to persuade readers to "follow the inner self" this work actually harbors hat 
 T. is my favourite composer but the interpretation on this CD is rather like a good effort in high shoo 
 Aaron Sisson works in the English mining industry, and is also a talented flortist. Disenchanted with his life, he leaves his wife and children and finds work with an orchestra in London. There, and in Italy, he tries to come to terms with his life and emotions whilst finding new acquaintances in London society and then with Britons in Italy.   The novel centres on Aaron's alienation, his retreat from and aversion to responsibility for others: it is right to stay in a relationship when you are feeling untrue to yourself by doing so? Just what are individuals' responsibilities to each other?   These are familiar Lawrence themes and will come as no surprise to those who have read his other works. It's also very much a novel of its time: pseudo-fascist ideas are in the air - social Darwinism and Nietzschean thought permeate the attitudes of the main characters, especially Lilly.  That being said, this is somewhat second-rate Lawrence. It's a very bitty novel: it was written in haste, sections completed then left for a considerable amount of time. And it reads like that. Few of the characters are convincingly drawn, others appear then disappear without reason and without contributing to the novel in any meaningful way. The strength of the prose is variable, with large sections of the novel stagnating as a result.  One for those interested in reading Lawrence's lesser-known works, but I should imagine a turn-off for those trying him out for the first time.  G Rodger 
 This book is a real let down. I thought that each of the first two books contained some of the best genre prose to come along since Jim Thompson and Raymond Chandler roamed the streets. "The sign of the Book" On the other hand (if looked at objectively) is a pretty pathetic offering to what still could be a very interesting and drawn out series. I think that my main beef with this latest Dunning book is that it just doesn't stack up plot wise to the masterful turnings of "Booked to Die". Instead we as readers are confronted with an alarmingly cut and dry thriller that felt as old as the crumbling Kentucky Blue Ridge Mountains. Secondly, as others have pointed out, Janeway is starting to get a little stale as a literary figure. He has stopped growing here. Instead of as in earlier books, where the reader was able to watch Janeway come to life through Dunnings gifts as an author, here in "Sign of the Book" we see Janeway suffocating on formula.  If you enjoyed the other Dunning books and are looking for something along similar lines to this series, I would suggest the overlooked author Douglas Kennedy. He has one really good one from a decade or so ago called the 'Big Picture'. The plot here really reminds me of Dunning at his best. 
 This series is being sold with missing episodes, like many others here in Unbox. Do they think their customers are so dumb? Would you buy a DVD series with a missing DVD? What sense does this make? What a disappointment this service is.. 
 Boy do I feel like a sucker, this is likely the most useless, "living the art life" type of book I have ever read. Mr. Dorrell uses this book mainly as a platform for his ego-rich, self serving anecdotes and know it all type of advise and opinions. Have you ever been to a party with one guy who just "knows" everything and can not wait for an opportunity to tell you his opinion on anything ... that is how this book reads. It was irritating to say the least. If you have any art degree or have been to art school or have ever done anything art related at all, you already know whatever practical advice you can squeeze out of this book.   If you want good inspirational books on "living the artist life" pick up Art & Fear by David Bayles and Ted Orland (amazing book), The Shape of Content by Ben Shahn or The Art Spirit by Robert Henri. If you want to run an art business, it sounds cheesy but pick up How to Start a Home Based Crafts Business by Kenn Oberrecht, very practical and no-nonsense - not just for crafts. 
 This book started out great!I read the last book Beneath a Blood Red Moon,and could not wait to read it.Blah! The book just falls apart towards the middle.I could not sat focused.Im not planning on reading anymore of her vampire novels.They just seem to repeat themselves.I think Drake is turning into the Danielle Steele of Horror/Romance 
   Where's the editing in this book?  While a memoir, by definition, presents facts (or not!) filtered through the author's memory, bias and interpretation, an editor or reviewer should still reflect upon the writing skills and organization offered to the reader.  Unfortunately, Ms. Salinger offered the minutiae of her personal and family history in a way that was to the point in describing her tortured childhood, but often tediously anecdotal, and quite often ambiguous (did her mother beat her or was Peggy's memory lapse just that?  Was Peggy clairvoyant? Was she her brother's protector or did she hate him initially as suggested by her father's comment?).  Overall, the book suffers from a lack of structure and too many writing approaches - sometimes comic slang, sometimes well-written philosophical interpretation.  It would be difficult to sum up Ms. Salinger's overall personal writing style.  She almost sadly seems to attempt to copy her father's style at times.  Her best approach, to me, is in the final section where she seems to combine both directness with deep, creative insight into her past and the characters inhabiting it.     Those looking for details of J. D.'s life and motivation should not expect to rely upon this memoir for facts.  Either this accounting by Ms. Salinger was mis-advertised as such or, in my opinion, missed it's mark.  The book is about Margaret Salinger, not J.D., and, as such, presents her journey from a perceived troubled childhood, through the not-so-unique emotional upheaval of adolescence - popularity, note-passing, boyfriends, some miserable teachers and loneliness (a la Holden Caulfield?), serious emotional and physical disabilities, to a final level of personal peace and acceptance of the fact that she apparently had miserable parents.   References to J.D. Salinger's writing were most often inserted into multitudes of footnotes, interrupting what written flow there was, but were haphazardly left in the text in other instances for no distinguishable reason.  An ambitious initial and insightful attempt to relate Mr. Salinger's life's events to his motivation seemed to dwindle away as the memoir continued.  Disappointment over this tactic arises not so much from the loss of interpretation but to the overall lack of focus and structure. 
 I am a behavioral economist with a deep belief in the notion that human decision-makers deviate in important ways from the scientific principles laid down in modern rational choice theory. There is no doubt but that very many investors hold erroneous notions of the dynamics of price movements, and having a correct understanding will, on average lead to better returns on one's portfolio. Sheffrin presents the evidence for this position in an interesting and accessible manner.  Shefrin's main advice for investors is absolutely correct, and would improve the asset positions of many poor souls with idiotic notions of stock dynamics. His advice is that if you are not a gifted and dedicated stock expert, you should invest in a low-maintenance cost array of mutual funds, and above all, do not churn your stocks. It doesn't help to be smart, lucky, a stud with the girls, or blessed by God. Moreover, if you think you have one of the "gifted analysts" for a broker, you are to be counted as among the suckers who are never given an even break.  Shefrin has another thesis which he presents with great verve, but which is on very shakey grounds. This is that "gifted stock analysts" can on average, significantly out-perform the market. He believes this MUST be the case if a significant fraction of investors are behaving irrationality. However, there is another possibility, which is that stock brokers as a group gain from the excessive churning that irrational investors permit or ask them to do, but that it is impossible to "beat the market" except by pure luck or by personally studying firm fundamentals and future prospects.  Shefrin's data in favor of the "gifted analyst" is episodic and anecdotal, and there is plenty of data on the other side. For instance, in Malkiel's classic "Random Walk Down Wall Street", he relates the evidence that chimps throwing darts do as well as major brokerage houses. Sheffrin presents contrary evidence for a more recent period in which "gifted experts" outperform the random darts. New evidence, collected by Money magazine, shows that a group of experts did far worse than the darts in 2003. All of this evidence is spotty and anecdotal. The plural of anecdote is not data.  I am not convinced by this book that the efficient markets hypothesis, applied to final returns to investors (after payments to stock brokers and other transactions costs), is not correct. I think the author makes a mistake taking so strong a position when the evidence is so weak on this account. I am certainly not convinced that Malkiel's analysis is in any way overturned by new evidence.  However, if Shefrin convinces a few investors to act more sanely, he will have fulfilled an important social function.  
 Kid "Rock" is to rock-and-roll what Twinkies are to gourmet cooking.  He's a poseur and a pretender, who tries to mimick the attitude and style of those who went before him -- Bob Seeger, Rolling Stones -- while hoping that no one will notice that he has none of their talent.  Why listen to a pale imitation when the music of the true greats is still available?  
 I thought this book was really far fetched.  Parts of this book are wonderful and very entertaining.  Other sections of the book just do not seem accurate.  I realize this is a fictional book, but I really think with a little more editing this story would have been great.  I enjoyed reading the description of the kidnapping at Phipps Plaza in Atlanta as it seemed very accurate and scary down to every minute detail.  On the other hand, the chat room crap seemed a little far fetched although who knows there are plenty of sick people in this world.  I just do not really believe there would be people willing to pay money for other women in such a fashion, but who knows as maybe there really are people out in the world like mentioned in this book.  I hope I never encounter them 
 I ordered this book as a gift and found it completely unsuitable because of the photo on the backcover. The gift was intended for a father of 2 small children; he certainly would not want a book with a cover photo of a  man with a vulgar word written on his forehead and making a vulgar gesture.  Neither one of us is a prude, but this is something you don't want around  children. I only wish that Amazon could let customers know what the back  cover looks like in cases like this. I wasted money and time! I'm sure the  inside content would have been interesting, but a coffee table book's  cover--back AND front--need to be suitable for public consumption 
 America is a troubled boy.  He is separated from his foster mother, has lived in a mall and in Central Park for months.  At the time of this book he is a patient at Ridgeway, a hospital.  He meets repatedly with Dr. B who tries to help America figure himself out.  Since America is so troubled, he naturally speaks with obscene language.   The language is understandable for the plot of the book, but not appropriate for a school library 
 Most poeple insist that freedom of expression should be granted without any restrictions.  This book and the events which occured shortly thereafter state that the boundries of decency must be observed.    Those that argue that Hitler was a product of his time should look at the events in Bosnia.  Muslims were killed and placed in concentration camps just like the Jews in WW2.    In 1958 Britain detained 80,000 Kenyans who were fighting the British occupation.  Most of them perished due to torture.    Books like this must never be ignored because it is a lesson we should learn from.   
 I finally threw my TruTemp instant digital thermometer away last night after several inaccurate readings caused me to overcook a lovely piece of beef. I had noticed some problems with readings on previous occasions but gave it the benefit of the doubt. I am now in the market for a new digital thermometer. As the saying goes, "once burned.... 
 I was at my cousan's house and we were listenening to these old tapes that were in a shobox. It was really funny. This is nothing like the music or today. This is the music you hear in groshery stores. We also listened to pink floyd the wall, dark side of the moon, and the first cut. These were a little better becuase they sound all angry and loud and how they hate school. 
 OK, 72 pages of cliff notes for a 144 page book?  That is absurd!  Night is a classic work, filled with vivid metaphor and intensely emotional characters.  You could get a third of the way through it in the time it would take to BUY the cliff notes 
 I got this and the RangeBooster is a lie. It has NOT boosted any kind of range on my network. It also goes in and out of service often. I wasted my money on this one 
 I returned this contract and asked for a refund but NEW ignored my first two emails. Then I called them and they informed me of their shady business practice that it would take 8 weeks to refund my account. I then contacted Amazon and they resolved the matter in one day. I read reviews for NEW and most people that actually had to deal with NEW were not happy. The 77% positive rating they have is misleading because the majority of people rating them have never actually had to use the product.  
 This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel 
 The three books in Kim Stanley Robinson's "Mars Trilogy" are my absolute all-time-favorites. So, it comes as no surprise that when this book was published, I immediately snapped it up! However, I was definitely disappointed. The stories in "The Martians" are not of the same quality as the "Mars Series" and seem to be all the pieces that someone *wisely* recommended that he remove from the original stories. In fact, it didn't even seem like the same person had written "The Martians" ... but more like someone stole Kim Stanley Robinson's good name. Moral? Just because they publish it doesn't mean it's good. Pass on this one, it's not worth your money; stick to the "Mars Series" instead 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 Terminal ALS disease-suffering Donald and his kin make the average dysfunctional family look like the Cleavers. Skillfully developed, yet unlikable: to know them is not to love, nor even like them. Part I, II, III and IV are each narrated by a different person: dying Donald; his step-nephew Kenneth, aka K; his intelligent, one-track-minded brother-in-law David; and his grieving wife, Cynthia. Somehow, within this one (extended) family, exists: a man who renames his wives after his beloved horse, a man who kills a dog, a man who wants to kill a man who has killed a dog, step-cousins who have an ongoing intimate relationship, a man who rapes a preteen, a man who is constantly after a lil' somethin' somethin', several drug and/or alcohol abusers, a tutor who seduces an (adult) student, a woman who places her foot on aroused part of her brother, an elementary school student who is placed in a janitor's closet for five hours with his mouth taped shut, and a boy who completes 130 continuous miles on a bicycle (even though his chain breaks twice). People die, are depressed, grieve, but it's unlikely that readers will care about the pathetics who make up the bulk of the story. A man's soliciting of a child prostitute while serving in Korea is inexplicably told as, "...he made love to hungry girls for candy bars..." Although Part I, narrated by Donald, feels a bit like Gilead with a Native-American spiritual slant, the rest includes many less than stellar thoughts, actions, and dreams by a less than stellar cast of characters. 
 I ordered the Chocolate & Mint variety. Amazon had them for a great price and shipped them quickly. However, I ordered the cookies in early November, and they arrived with a "Best When Used By" date of December 4, 2006. They will expire less than a month after they arrived!  I'm not sure if this is Amazon's fault or not. The cookies are shipped in the manufacturer's Back to Nature box, so it could be the company is unloading older cases of merchandise on Amazon.com 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 I was looking for a book that would give me some great recipes to use with my new food processor.  I was not happy with this one. There aren't a whole lot of recipes and a lot of the ingredients are not very common in our household.  I usually have capers, anchovy paste, greek olive etc. So I am not talking ketchup and mustard here.  I am talking about tahini, lemon grass, and indian relish (what is that, and where do you get it?)  I enjoy cooking for my family, but I am more apt to use recipes with ingredients I will use for other recipes.  In addition, a lot of the recipes are very complex, which is okay, but cooking doesn't have to be complex to be either gourmet, or tastey.  There are a couple of recipes I will try:  Mushroom caviar, Oh-my-God Cheesecake and Stuffed Artichokes.  Other recipes I will probably never do are: Sweet Potato Soup w/ coconut milk, lemongrass & cilantro, Terrine of Pork & Ham w/ Calvados & Juniper Berries, Leek & Sweet Red Pepper flan, Chicken Liver & Red Onion Jam. I also ordered The Food Processor Bible.  There are many more recipes that aren't so elaborate and more for daily use 
 The extreme reviews here are very misleading; people either say it's the worst film ever made or Godard's best film. Don't believe either camp. If you're not an expert on Godard and/or 1960s avant-garde cinema, I could definitely see a person writing off this movie as "sheer pretentious crap", but that opinion would derive from a mixture of shock and ignorance. On the other hand, those who say this is Godard's finest work must be riding high on acid and Marxism themselves. The truth of the matter is that "Weekend", like every one of Godard's post-Anna Karina films, is more a flawed experiment than anything else: On occasion, interesting and thought-provoking, but more often static and didactic to the point of alienating the viewer rather than converting them. I respect Godard's attempt to create a new cinema built on "ideas" rather than "emotion", but in my opinion, he went too far in this direction. A piece of art devoid of any emotion is a hollow experience and don't we have enough of that in our crude, consumerist society? And as far as experiments go, much of what he was doing in "Weekend", he had already done and with vastly better results in  "Pierrot le Fou". That film was a perfect balance between Godard the political-scientist and Godard the post-modern film-maker. Plus, "Pierrot le Fou" benefited by having Jean-Paul Belmondo and Anna Karina. They brought heart and humor to Godard's abstract explosion of ideas; a perfect symbiotic relationship between director and actor(s) that he never achieved again. "Weekend" starts off very promising with the sex dialogue and the long tracking shot of the traffic-jam, leading to a car-crash...but then it descends into a grating mess of dated ideology and too much dead space. You really wish Belmondo and Karina would pop in and show the cast they don't have to be mere nails to Godard's hammer. 
 I just ran my first (and last) cd through the Scratch repair system and it made the disk look worse than when I started.  Didn't take off any of the scratches and the scratch remover actually made dozens of perpendicular marks of its own.  It really is worse than when I started.  
 This must have been fun to record but it feels to me like they were just having a lark w/country music. As a result, it's competently performed, but bland in a sort of Country Lite kind of way. When famous musicians cross genres, it's more rewarding when they at least bring us something new, or dive in w/both feet and give us the texture of the new genre--I was looking forward to something more. Instead, it's like hearing a good country cover band in a Las Vegas lounge (nothing wrong w/that, but at least in Vegas the music is free).  There are many better country or folk or bluegrass albums on the market right now that are more rewarding than this. Start with, say, "You Don't Know Me - Songs of Cindy Walker," just released by Willie Nelson, a better example of how to do a tribute album. 
 OK so was I the only one that thought this novel was depressing?  I found the characters to be weak individuals and all frightened of each other; they have to tiptoe and walk on eggshells at every turn.  Who has that many regrets and self doubts about EVERY SECOND of their lives?  Not the enjoyable summer reading I was expecting.  Do not bother with this one!!  If I could this would get zero star 
 Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read "The Myth Of Gender" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting 
 I am an adult with ADHD inatintive type. I have struggled all my life with this condition.  Howevere, I have managed to earn a BA in psychology and I am currently working on a masters degree.  Because of my expierences in psychology classes I know something about scientific research and empirical evidence.  This book was a major dissapointment to me because it lacks the  simple scholary research to prove the claims made by Dr Lawless. I am afraid this book is nothing more then modernday snake-oil that will cause more harm then good.  This book is so full of pseudo-science that I fear it may cause a great deal of harm to children and adults with ADHD.  Dr. Lawless is a psychologist and should now how to read the scientifice research on the subject found in peer reviewed journals.  While, I believe that the chemeicals in the foods we eat are a major cause of illnesses, ADHD and obesity, There is little scientific evidence that add is caused by diet. However, their maybe more evidence in the future.  One of his clames of red dye has been proven completly false.  Another one his claims about magnet theropy are so out of the scientific mainstream that he comes of as a snakeoils salesman.  Please do not buy this book.  If you want reliable information by on of the Driven to Distraction books 
 This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached.  The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer.  I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting.  It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps.  I was very disappointed in this carseat.  I would not purchase it again.  I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco.  If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured.  Try those ones first.  This is an awful carseat. 
 While I tend to always take the horror movie genre with a grain of salt, this movie kind of irked me. I mean I read how the director/writer of this film is an editor at Cinescape, so I had hoped that the movie would not fall into some of the pitfalls that   most of the recent horror films have fallen into. This is not true, there are pitfalls a plenty in this. There was SO much potential at least I thought, but the movie falls flat rather quick. The pace of the film is very off setting and to be honest I was watching it on Scifi (my local video store doesn't have it), but yet I was kind of losing track of who is who and what they were doing in the haunted aslyum in the first place (example Meg and her brother. I also think the  BIGGEST AAGGGHH moment was when the  friend and the blonde hero girl (see can't remember names cause it was truly eh characters and characterization) were sitting on the lobby and talking, and the girl sees a shadow while the guy is looking at her, and she asks: "Did you see that?". NO HE WAS LOOKING AT YOU! I just honestly thought it could of had been better, although the maggot clown scene was pretty good, it just needed a better film around it 
 I am at a loss to hear what people appreciate about this CD.  We were barely able to make it through one listening.  This is a classic example of a CD that NEVER would have been produced had the artist (using the term very loosely) not already been famous for something besides music.  The lack of talent and originality on this CD is apalling.  It only gets a star because that's the lowest rating.  I want my money back 
 From previous reviews, I got the idea that "Never come Morning" would be gritty, and a masterpiece.  Well, that's not the case.  It is quite gritty, with EVERYONE a crook, from a Polish barber who is also a pimp, from the one-eyed police detective.  The story follows Bruno, a thug who dreams of well..being the Great White Hope.  Of course, we know he's a thug, and will always be nothing but a thug.  Bruno and his thuggish friends talk in a Chicago dialect that grates on your nerves.  Algren is not Mark Twain, so it further alienates the reader when you want to hear English you can recognize.  I felt zero sypathy for Bruno's predicament, and I felt sick that Steffi would see anything in this character 
 WOULD SOMEONE WHO HAS READ THIS BOOK PLEASE WRITE A REVIEW MORE THAN 7 WORDS LONG SO THOSE OF US WHO HAVEN'T READ IT WILL HAVE AN IDEA WHAT IT IS ABOUT 
 Although this book was recommended to me by a professional I must say that I was terribly disappointed. Out of the entire book the only part I actually did agree with was that in general a lot of us treat dogs as humans when they really should be treated like the animals that they are.   With that in mind, Donaldson believes dogs to be quite stupid and not capable of working for anything other than food. I have had and trained dogs for years and have never had to result to such pandering. Dog's are extremely intelligent and can be taught anything without giving a treat every few seconds. (She even suggests using cut up hot dogs to 'motivate' your dog. Those hot dogs with all the perservatives and additives are going to do more damage to the dog than whatever the behavior is worth.)  She focuses an inordinate amount of time to teaching a dog to fetch saying that this one move will solve most other problems. I can't disagree more. The things that works best for dogs is exercise and strong leadership. Besides, some breeds are generally not interested in playing fetch but rather doing the activites for which is bred in the first place.  Also, Donaldson tries to refute Pack Theory, which takes into account the fact that dogs evolved from wolves and hence have a strict social hierarchy, by showing her own ignorance on the subject. In her view she only sees dominance as being cruel and punishing your dog into submission. When in reality it alleviates the need for punishing since your dog will do what you say because he knows that you are the boss.  Throughout the book she contradicts herself constantly on her own points. This shows me that she does not have a great deal of self examination of her own information and that it isn't worth much.  I believe that her book does very little to help people with dogs that have any issues whatsoever.   I recommend Cesar Milan's book and his approach. I have used several of his techniques with no damage to my dog, as Donaldson would have you believe, and I got the results that I wanted.   Do not buy Culture Clash as it is really only good for being recycled. 
 ﻿In the end, it appears that by "anti-Catholic prejudice", Jenkins means a failure to regard what he considers to be the core of the Roman Catholic church with sufficient reverence.   He would probably characterize most of the practicing Catholics I know as near-heretical.  Jenkins uses related but distinct words like "bigotry" and "prejudice" interchangeably. It is clear by the end that a great deal of what he is terming "prejudice", which is usually applied to hostility from outsiders, is in fact internal dissent and dissatisfaction from current and former Catholics.  I refuse to be embarrassed on behalf of my society at large if the hierarchy of any organization is having problems keeping the flock in line.  The book is quite interesting, containing a vast amount of information, including a lot which seems to argue against Jenkin's point.  I don't know whether to congratulate him to have the honesty to include it or to suppose that he has completely failed to understand how others might see it.  Jenkins is attempting to gain momentum from the various "liberation" movements that have arisen in the wake of the Civil Rights movement that became prominent in the 1950s.   To this end, he employs the tried and true propaganda technique of beginning history at a point where one's own side can be made to look like an injured innocent, i.e., the anti-Catholicism of nativists and Know-Nothings.  If he really wants to trace the history of Protestant/Catholic conflict, he needs to go back to the Reformation at least.  It would also be appropriate to mention the Vatican's anti-Americanism during the same period; many churches were offended that Americans considered the people, rather than God,to be the legitimate source of political power.   In any case, it is irrelevant, since the book largely ignores the unfortunately still extant strains of real anti-Catholic prejudice, such as the fundamentalist Protestant groups who regard the Pope as the anti-Christ. Jenkins's real foe is people whose argument with the Catholic Church is not really religious but social.  Representatives of the Church have often argued that it is their duty to enter into debates of public legislation and morality and I can't disapprove of the participation of any citizen in public debates.   They all enter at the same level, however, and those who participate in the brawl of public debate (excuse me, the marketplace of ideas) must expect sometimes very harsh criticism, although I shall always hope, often in vain, for a level of civility and honest consideration of differing viewpoints.  Jenkins feels that the Church should be accorded special reverence by all; he seems to suggest that any criticism borders on bigotry.  The Church should be permitted to make strongly worded pronouncements without risking strongly worded retorts.   To Jenkins, any dispute between the Church and any other group, including dissenting Catholics, is proof of anti-Catholic prejudice.  He would probably deny this and attempts at several points to explain the difference between prejudice/bigotry and acceptable dissent, but the main difference seems to be that acceptable dissent is removed in time and place.  Jenkins mentions that the Masons were originally welcoming to Catholics, but after what he admits to be a campaign of slander and libel by the Church hierarchs, became decidely less friendly.  Jenkins blames the Masons for the ill-will, even though he admits that the Church threw the first rhetorical punch.   In many ways, Jenkins does as much as any "No-Nothing" to argue that "real" Catholics are unable to live in a secular, multireligious society.  It is in his discussion of homosexual issues that this becomes most clear.   I share Jenkins' outrage at the invasion of St. Patrick's Cathedral by Act-Up, but for the most part he discusses the incident as if the police refused their assistance and society at large applauded; he does eventually admit that even many gay activists were appalled.  I have enough sympathy for the points that Jenkins raises about the problems of expecting rapid change with regard to a long-standing and widespread condemnation of homosexually that I would expect to be charged with homophobia.  As an outsider, I would not presume to tell the Church how to regard homosexuality or insist that they sanctify gay marriages.   At the same time, if the church is going to condemn gays as hell-bound and attempt to frustrate their efforts to reach an accomodation with the larger society, it is ridiculous for him to take umbrage at non-violent complaints.     Jenkins completely misses the point in his discussion on pedophilia.   The issue for most people is less that some priests are pedophiles than the apparent inability of the Church to deal with the issue.  People being what they are, this has presumably been an organizational problem for more than 1500 years, yet the Church seems baffled.   Some people do see this as an opportunity to beat the Church and its policy of celibacy over the head, but in fact civil authorities have in the past tried to spare the Church embarrassment by declining to prosecute and trusting the Church to deal with erring priests.   Jenkins ignores this and complains that the organizational strength of the church makes it a tempting target for grandstanding prosecutors, forgetting that this is the very reason that the problems were concealed for so long.  The Church is paying more for its own failure to deal with the problem than for the individual transgressions of certain priests 
 Very little plot, which is boring. The reader should be paid by the page, if not by the word, to read this book! 
 One of the best books for first course in topology. There is some weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great. 
 I didn't know why I chose to read this book. Anyway, it was disappointing, really. The book was slow, and it was too long for a story of its type. I mean, I think the book could go on without some of the parts. When I was reading it, I only thought of putting it down because it's making me go crazy. I thought the plot was shallow, but Taylor's self-conflict was even shallower. He kept on blaming himself about his father's death well then it's really his fault! He was a coward. If you don't believe me, go on and read about it... although you might get bored getting to that part because it's towards the end. And I hated it when this stupid conflict got in the way with his relationship with Denise. He was acting really immature! He should have at least thought about Denise but he was too selfish. It really sucked.  And yes, I know that this is supposed to be a romance novel... but I kept on looking for that love factor althroughout the book. And what did I find? NOTHING. Oh, what a waste. It's like Sparks tried very hard to make the situations in the story seem romantic but as a reader, it didn't really capture the whole essence of what romantic situations should be like.  If it hadn't been for my HRR (Home Reading Report) I wouldn't have finished reading this at all.  I guess I'm saying this because I'm not into this genre. Love stories are fine but this one... nah 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this clown, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 Keynes was no doubt an influential economist.  His theories and 'expertise' on economics influenced the post-New Deal economic policies of the United States and the internationalist wealth redistribution schemes like IMF.  However, his ideas on economics failed miserably and it was application of Keynesian ideas that wrecked so much havoc on the U.S. particularly in the 1970s with the stagflation (an inflationary recession with unemployment which was theoretically impossible accordingly to Keynesism.)  We have Keynes to thank for budget deficits and the nebulous idea that we can spend ourselves into prosperity through the largesse of the federal government.  Read Planning for Freedom or Socialism by Ludwig von Mises instead 
 "This is how one ought to see," I kept saying as I looked down at my trousers, or glanced at the books in the shelves "This is how one ought to see, how things really are." Things without pretensions, satisfied to be merely themselves, sufficient in their Suchness. "The nearest approach to this," I said, "would be a Vermeer." Yes, a Vermeer. For that mysterious artist was trebly gifted-with the vision that perceives the Dharma-Body as "the hedge at the bottom of the garden" with the talent to render as much of that vision as the limitations of human capacity permit, and with the prudence to confine himself in his paintings to the more manageable aspects of reality; for though Vermeer represented human beings, he was always a painter of still life. The essential Not-self could be perceived very clearly in things and in living creatures on the hither side of good and evil. - Aldous Huxley, THE DOOR OF PERCEPTION  
 The manufacturer added little "tabs" because these labels are so thin that they tear when you try to remove them from the backing.  The tabs don't help much and they don't tear cleanly from the label.  A solution to a problem that creates yet another problem.  The best solution would be to purchase another brand.  
 waste of money.  does not fit most car seats and the info on the package does not specify this 
 The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling.  The book just never fulfills that promise.  Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful.  Well, that's not a shocker.  But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work.  For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial.  The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere.  No new thinking.  Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl.  I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops.  A real disappointment 
 This is the only Heinlen book ive read and it will likely be the last. The story starts out interesting enough - the human race travelling through space in a giant starship that they believe IS the whole universe. Through the course of events, the main character, Hugh, learns the real nature of the ship and futilly attempts to educate the population of his discoveries due to everyone else's religious beliefs about the ship - the universe as they know it. This is another interesting concept, however, the story is marred with dull characters  and a weak ending. I would recommend this book for children in grade school, but not for anyone who is looking for "serious" science fiction 
 I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages.  The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens.  Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back 
 Minter is yet another biased hack who portrays himself as being unbiased and an investigative journalist when his role is to be a lackey for the right-wing. The man went to Vassar- what a waste of a fine education. Avoid this book if you are looking for the truth 
 My son received a Bumbo seat for Christmas.  At five months of age, he rolled out of it and was laying on top of the seat.  At six months of age, he turned in the seat and fell on to his HEAD on two different occassions.  The seat was on a flat surface.  He did this and I was standing or sitting right next to him. I loved this seat when he first got it.  I told everyone I knew about it. He has two older siblings and he  loved to be able to watch them play.  His siblings loved him sitting in the seat because he was at their level.    Now, I have absolutely NO confidence in the safety of this seat.  It is completely useless as his "own body weight" DOES NOT "keep baby in place" as advertised.  The seat has been rendered useless in my home because it is NOT safe and it is safer to put him in a traditional bouncy seat or on the floor. 
 I have read all the books n the series and have come to expect an enjoyable light read with a little mystery. I thought the menace in this book overwhelmed the 'light' plots. There are serious themes here - murder, death, kidnapping, and others. Too bad the authors didn't focus more on the light plotlines that reader's look for in these books - Maggie's romance (this came across as ridiculous considering the fact that Maggie and her daughter were being stalked by a convicted murderer) and the Jamie / Max story  (which unfortunately is treated as a throwaway storyline). I also disliked the way the authors abruptly got rid of Destiny - love her character or hate it - she has been in enough books that longtime readers care about her. 
 This movie is only good for those that "love" Alyssa Milano.  Plot?  It isn't non-existent.  It DOES exist but it's a complete crap!  Period.  Just an excuse to show skin.  Regarding the DVD, it's a barebones one but picture and audio quality is as good as most New Line Cinema releases, anamorphic and stuff, plus it's the best release of the movie if we compare it with releases in other regions.  You won't be disappointed in that aspect 
 For someone with just the basic knowledge of accounting or finance, this book would certainly pose a challenge- especially with the case problems 
 I tested this out as soon as I got it and was not thrilled with the results.  The steamer barely took the wrinkles out of a satin shirt after I used almost the entire container of water.  The product might work better on cotton or a sturdier fabric.  In a pinch, if you have the time to go over the garment numerous times this item is for you.  From what I have read this is one of the best of the travel garment steamers.  Maybe my expectation were a little to high. Pros -Easy to use -price (same product at Sharper Image for lots more) Cons -Helped but didn't get all the wrinkles out 
 Amazon image appears to be of standard edition while text without explanation of this being miniature press is buried far below. Looks like a crackerjack prize and contains only slightly more info. Very disappointing 
 I rented this, and once downloaded it stated that my client license was up.  Tech support couldnt help me, and instead just refunded my money.  It was nothing but a waste of time 
 the green one is brilliant-- i couldn't put it down. the positions in the blue version make no sense to me and ward doesn't explain much. 
 I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful 
 This book is written for someone with a 6th grade education and no more. It talks about magamps for pete's sake. It dosen't even broach the subject of transistors. NO TRANSISTOR THEORY!! What in sakes is electronics if not transistors! The stupid objectives at the beginning of each chapter, and the even worst review problems at the end of each chapter are simply a waste of pages. I am a former nuke electrician from the navy and a current IC Fabrication Technician in the semiconductor industry. I purchased the book to just stay up on my studies, but this book fell way short. My fiancee's daughter has learned almost everything that is covered in this book, and she is only in the 7th grade. Be forewarned, a bad book indeed 
 The episodes for Naruto are quality but in this case, due to errors in the description I can not recommend the DVD.  When I ordered the DVD, I made sure to check the language options of the DVD.  This one indicates that a Japanese language option is available.  Unfortunately this is incorrect.  If you do not mind this being an all english DVD with the television broadcast editting, than this is for you.  Naruto is not so far editted compared to other anime series that the series is hampered and the english actors do a relatively good job with the translation.  However, if you prefer the japanese version, this DVD is not for you. 
 I'm surprised by all the praise this movie gets here at Amazon and beyond. There really wasn't much here I liked. The soundtrack was the usual "pap" you'd expect from a family friendly movie, though the sets were nice. It seems this movie was just miscast. Mel just doesn't do comedy all that well, at least for a lead role. Jame Garner, the reason I bought this seems more like a bystander. And Jodie is Jodie and I never bought for a moment she was her character.   Although the cast is a powerhouse (on paper), sadly the chemistry never really works and the jokes are just cornball. An example: There was a sequence when Bret asks his friends (who are standing behind him) to whistle to reveal themselves to some bandits he was confronting; which as it turns out they are unable to do. Instead Jodie and James, blow madly, just like the movie.  This movie reminds me a HELL of a lot like ''The Three Amigo's''; on paper you would think it couldn't miss, but on film it's painful to watch 
 They totally misrepresent this product. It does not work with Macs. I feel cheated and lied to by Memorex, shame on you 
 I had high hopes for this book as I thought it would address spirituality in a humanistic way.  At first, I thought I agreed with the 'accepting of self' philosophy, but gradually statements made by the author just didn't ring true.  I kept on thinking that maybe I was resistant to the reevaluation of my own thought processes, but gave up when the author spoke of a patient who found out her husband was cheating on her and the author's response was that she had control issues (!?!) and was acting like a victim.  I think at that moment, perhaps she feeling victimized.  But instead of telling her to 'embrace her victim', she is a control freak. Then he presents depression like it is some kind of choice, instead of a chemical imbalance.  Perhaps depression can spawn creativity, but you have to be able to get out of bed first -- and that is a problem.  I gave up on the book after that 
 Not only is the Text out of date Berkhofer never goes anywhere with his ideas.  He just ends up repeating himself over and over until they have lost all meaning.  It is amazing to me that a book that has no point could ever get published 
 I really like chill music when I am working and  relaxing but this had to be the biggest disappointment of all the chill CD's that I have purchased from Dido's poorly constructed vocal to whereever some of the other tracks got their inspiration it sounds like a compilation of leftovers 
 why is it that 3rd party memory cards can store at least double the information that these can? These memory cards are way over priced.   I love PS2. It's one of the best systems I have ever played and owned, but this memory card stuff is a scam. I already own 2 cards and I need more. 
 This is not only the "Worst Noel" it's probably the worst Christmas book- or worst book ever! I fought my way through the whole thing and I can say this: Whoever is responsible for this book owes me around 10 hours of hard labor 
 OK. I'm not sure where to begin with this book. First of all, it is the most scattered, poorly focused book i have ever read. I am not sure why the chapter on the Iran-Iraq War was in the book, nor am I positive why the author spent so much time discussing South Africa. Many of the chapters did not fit and would have been better off in the appendix, while many of the appendices, such as the one on iran's missiles, would have been much better suited in the main text. Also, while much of the text is interesting, such as the Appendix on Hezbollah, the author spends too much time talking about that topic, and not its relationship with Iran. While this book is supposed to be about Iran's nuclear weapons program, very little time is actually spent discussing it.  The most glaring flaw with this book is that it lacks definitive proof to support many of the claims the author is making. He takes many analytical short cuts, arriving at dubious assessments based on questionable evidence. His chapter on the Iranian involvement in 9/11 is bizarre, and i find it hard to believe that the US, based upon the information provided by the intelligence community, attacked the wrong country, while the author, based on his limited sources, was correct.  The bottom line is that this book is at times sensationalist and before the Iraq war I read scores of books that were similar in their apocolyptic tones.  While much of the information in this book is interesting, such as the bits on Islamic culture, I caution the reader to keep a healthy skepticism in regards to many of the author's claims, and suggest that Venter takes a class on how to organize a paper 
 I am glad I listened to the reviewer that mentioned the Ankle Pain. I thought these shoes were very cute and exactly what I needed for my trip to Florida. They are indeed very cute on -- but run a half size large so buy a half-size down. I ended up returning them because I wore them around the house, and noticed my ankles were being forced to bend inwards. The size was correct, but the shoe is built to angle inward. I didn't wear them long enough to have pain, but it definitely was getting uncomfortable. The other annoying thing was the straps wouldn't stay shut, the velcro kept releasing. I was constantly re-fastening them just the short time I wore them. The style is perfect, I hope Skechers tweaks this model to fix what is wrong. I ended up buying the Skechers Bikers Tailgater (runs true to size), which is similar but has a better velcro strap, and have suede inserts where the mesh ones are on the Sightseers (I would have preferred the mesh given I was buying them for Florida) 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books

 Considering the sensational cast (Eli Wallach, Terrence Hill, Bud Spencer, Kevin McCarthy and Brock Peters), the Euro-western era it was made in and the locations where it was shot, Ace High is a major disappointment. The plot is uninvolving and incoherent, the cinematography is cramped and completely lacking in style, the music is weak during a time that spawned so many memorable soundtracks and the direction lacks any focus whatsoever. The editing looks like it was performed with a butcher's knife. After the first ten minutes, I knew I'd made a mistake buying it. A boring 120 minute piece of junk, Ace High is hopelessly outgunned by any number of great Italian westerns including Corbucci's The Mercenary or Parolini's Sabata series. Save your fistful of dollars for a better film 
 All of the writing & criticism of Martin Amis has as much credibility as his screenplay for the film  Saturn 3 with Farrah Fawcett, Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel. If you really must know what the moments gossip is in  Manhattan restaurants, skip Amis's laborious attempts at writing and skim  through the tabloid Talk to which he contributes. Though personally I think  the glossy photos of Gwinneth Paltrow are better. Amis adds to the humidity  in the title of his own book 
 My biggest problem with this book, is how much has been written in quotes. Conversations are spilled out in dialog that doesn't even begin to read like it actually happened - but the quotes lead you to believe it has been transcribed accurately from history, eather than the memory of a 78 year-old from events that occured many years ago. I can understand adding narrative, and even taking some liberties to make it interesting, but it reads so blatantly like it never happened. Especially the conversations with John. I can't even begin to believe for a second that it went down anything even remotely like what is laid out in this book. Which frankly, taints everything I'm reading - it all seems like propaganda, fiction, SCIENCE fiction. Yes, I suppose there's some enlightening information in here too, scattered among the storyline, and the questionable recollection, but not nearly enough to make this book worth buying. And the amount of pictures, photos, sketches, etc. is almost non-existant. This book doesn't tell history, it's trying to create history. If you can get it for free, than sure, get it - put it on your shelf next to your other Beatle books. But if you're looking to walk away with something new, without leaving a bad taste in your mouth, I'd pass 
 I thought the case was nice looking, but when actually using it, I was very dissapointed.  The case is not secure at all, it keeps sliding off.  If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle, I do not recommend the aluminum case 
 Bottom Line: Fans of A Series of Unfortunate Events will most likely be disappointed by this book.  "The End" does for series what the movie did for the franchise; and that's not good.  Before I get into the negatives, first let me state the positives.  While not as good as in earlier books, the writing in "The End" is clever and still has the trademark Snicket whit and wordplay, although the jokes seem forced and repetitive - but I guess it all depends on how you look at it.  Also, the final revelation in Chapter 14 (yes, there is an additional chapter at the end of the book) gives careful readers a lot to ponder.  As with all the other books in the series, this is a fun and fast read and, even though there are major problems, I must admit that I still had a good time reading this book.  That's about it for the positives.  Now for the downside.  First off, you will not find resolution to many of the series' mysteries in "The End": No information on the contents or location of the sugar bowl, nothing more about the purpose of VFD or its schism, nothing about the fates of the villains and volunteers from the fire at the Hotel Denouement (or the hidden library), not a word about the "man with a beard but no hair" and the "woman with hair but no beard," not a peep about the possible survival of one of the Baudelaire parents, etc, etc, etc.  The problem isn't that "The End" doesn't explicitly resolve these issues for us (did anyone actually expect that it would?), it's that the layers and layers of intrigue that have been building up for years are largely ignored.  The true unfortunate event would be if the series were to end like this, with nothing more to bring closure to these outstanding mysteries.  This volume does add an extensive cast of new characters, however they are all as flat as a pancake (read the book, then try telling one of your associates or enemies anything about the characters Marlow, Larsen, or almost any of the other islanders for that matter - bet you can't).  This time around even the series' mainstay, Count Olaf, seem utterly lifeless and even out of character.    The plot of this book is rather dull, which is perplexing considering that this is the longest book in the series. What you will find within the pages of this book are 12 chapters of fairly slow paced and repetitive "story," followed by a long Chapter 13 that is so utterly ridiculous that the writers of Scooby-Doo would feel guilty ending their story (let alone a beloved series) in such a way.  It is as if the author got to the end of the book and noticed he hadn't moved the ongoing story forward, so decided to have certain characters monologue about the fates of others.  For example, we have all been wondering what happened to the Quagmires and expecting some type of glorious reunion, but I'm quite sure that nobody wanted to hear Kit Snicket say "yeah, they captured some birds and then crashed into the ocean, where the 'question mark' shaped vessel swallowed them up.  I don't know if they're alive or not.  P.S. - Fiona and the Hook-Handed Man got swallowed too."  Lol!  As terrible as that sounds, the actual text in the book isn't much better than what I just wrote.  Not to spoil anything, but the bit about Count Olaf's fate isn't much better either.  The pacing is all wrong: why spend chapters going on about the tedium of island life, and then cram the important contents into a few scant sentences?  Judging by the response to this book, it looks like old Lemony has really dug himself a hole.  The fans are mad, and justly so.  Even if the series continues in spin-off books for years to come, many fans have been turned of by "The End" and just don't care anymore.  The prevailing attitude is that readers would be better off stopping with Book 12; in many ways it is better to use your imagination and think of the millions of possible ways that the series could have ended, rather than reading the thoroughly unfulfilling way that it did end.  All I can say is that if there are future books coming, they had better be something 'really' special, or "The End" may be the beginning of the end 
 I had the same experience as the reviewer on 11/17/2005.  I tested the UPS by shutting off the power at the breaker.  Within a minute, the UPS software shut down the computer (I had set for 4 minutes, so obviously the battery wasn't going to hold up long.  Only load was computer, monitor, and router).  At any rate, the shut down was successful.  But upon power-up, about 30 seconds into the reboot, the UPS beeped and cut power to the battery-backup outlets, which killed the computer mid-bootup and killed the router for a second or so. Absolutely worthless, as the whole reason I wanted the UPS was to prevent shutdowns during the occasional 2 minute power blips I have here 
 one of the worst movies ever    this stuff must have been made up and total lack of common sense makes this movie an amatureish comed 
 There is simply not enough room to refute the ideas concieved by Velikovsky. If you believe in his hypothesis's (remember, a theory has some evidence) then you owe it to yourself to risk these cherished beliefs. Many of the reviewers of Worlds in Collision who are lavishing praise on it claim the book is for those who have open minds. Anyone who considers themselves in possession of an open mind, and belives in the hypothesis advanced by Velikovsky HAS to read Carl Sagan's "Brocas Brain". This is a CHALLENGE. If you find yourself refusing to risk your beliefs by reading the rebuttel of one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century then you should realize that your beliefs stem from a emotional dependence on said beliefs, not a desire to view the universe openly. I had not realized fully the level of disilloushinment with mainstream science until I saw the reviews praising this book. Read this book, then read Brocas Brain. An unwillingness to expose oneself to counterarguments is the hallmark of the closed mind 
     I got this book on remainder, very cheap. It was not worth what I paid for it tho.     This was quickly written..or ghost written...by Larry Garrison and his sister Stephanie Good.     It is poorly written and hard to follow. There are no specifics, and much speculation. Things seem to be thrown into the mix simply for "sensationalism"     There are some passages that seem to show real emotion from Dave and this is sad. However, the book was totally premature, written much too quickly. Even since it's publication various new events and things occurred and it was out of date the day it came out since there has been no real resolution to this case.     Why did he write it so soon? It seems to be thrown together. The "Shango" stuff is pretty silly too, since those poems and stuff were on the web for months and were pretty much discredited. That was a prank not some real "cult" LOL    Sad book altogether and not worth the time 
 This book is well written but adds nothing to the discussions around Outsourcing and the impact Globalization has had on the U.S. Economy.  Not recommended for serious readers familiar with the issues 
 Campbell was quite prolific; why would he have published such a very short book? He didn't, actually, it was put together posthumously. Understanding the editor is key to understanding this book.  I found odd that such a short book could nonetheless be so incoherent and incomprehensible. After researching its editor, Eugene C. Kennedy, it made sense. What the publishers of this book don't tell you (don't want you to know?) is that Eugene C. Kennedy was a Catholic Maryknoll priest for 22 years, teaches at the Jesuit Loyola University, and is the author of such classics of humanist mythological studies as "Would You Like to be a Catholic?" and "Cardinal Bernadin's Stations of the Cross". This information puts "Thou Art That" into perspective.  The book starts out with (ex-)Father Kennedy's preposterous assertion that Campbell had some kind of deathbed conversion. Apparently Campbell's wife put Campbell in a Catholic hospital, then claimed that her husband had spent his entire life studying spirituality, mythology, and archetypes without ever once in his life "experiencing emotionally" their meaning... until he saw some kind of Catholic religious image before he died. This sounds like wishful thinking on the part of the "Doctrine of the Faith" department. I very much doubt this happened; the assertion puts Campbell's entire life's work into question. What kind of person could write about something his whole life without ever experiencing it emotionally?  Reading Kennedy's selection of Campbell's works is like reading Thomas Aquinas's selection of Arisotle's works: the result is a confused, disjointed mess, because the material has been gerrymandered in a sometimes desperate attempt to make the author more palatable to Catholic theology. It appears that very little of Campbell's work suits Kennedy's purposes, which would explain why the book is both so short and so fragmentary. At the very least, such an editing misrepresents the author.  Here's some Latin that the editor should have shared with you: "caveat emptor" 
 I've read this book with my third graders for the past several years.  They love it.  They enjoy having a candy corn contest of their own while reading the book 
 Joel Osteen almost never mentions the word "sin."  He's so popular because he tells people what they want to hear.  As for the book, it's garbage.  He says to stop thinking only about yourself and start thinking about others.  But the whole book is about thinking about yourself.  He says that you should be happy with what you do have rather than what you don't have.  But the entire book focuses on getting what you don't have.  He says Christians can get what they want by just visualizing and saying that they will get those things.  Does anyone other than Osteen actually believe that?  What about Christians who live in Rwanda, San Salvador and other poverty-stricken parts of the world?  Or does that way of thinking only apply in affluent societies?  He says Christians deserve special treatment.  But try acting that way at work or at a store and see how much others like you for it.  Don't read this book 
 There's nothing wrong with giving background on a subject, but Mr. Winchester abuses the privilege. There's no digression too minute, no reference too arcane, no place where one word can't be replaced with 100. When he does finally get to a set of pertinent points, the writing is excellent. That's what kept me from giving it a worse review. Too bad those excellent parts are as rare as cashews in a tub of economy-brand mixed nuts.   If you're prepared to work your way through the innumerable detractions and root out the nuggets, the book is worth your time. Otherwise, pass on it.  
 People referred to as psychopaths are human anomalies, probably accidents of nature, free of those constraints we call "conscience," who live among us like members of mainstream society, until their impulses lead them to acts of exploitation, deception, and self-gratification that leave us baffled.  Based on a career of working with psychopaths and their victims, Hare presents a flowing description of their world, interspersed with multiple case histories, effectively short and to-the-point.  As one reads, questions arise, but one only has to turn the page to find each question answered in the next section.  Hare's writing has that rare combination of carefully crafted simplicity, approprate drama, and scientific objectivism.  The case histories are like exerpts from film strips.  The degree of repetition is just right to drive home the simple messages regarding this perplexing human anomaly.  For those of us who have experienced psychopaths in our lives, and realize it, Hare's repeated humble admission that even he and his students are fooled from time to time is reassuring.  Unfortunately most of us who live in the company of psychopaths do not know it.  Their charm, charisma, deceptions, and manipulations are so effective that most people -- even those who consider themselves street-wise -- remain clueless or in denial, even when the truth is pointed out.  This book, therefore, will have more traction with those who realize that they have been "had" than with those have been "had" but fail to admit it.  This, perhaps, is the most important lesson of all.  Psychopaths influence our individual lives and entire societies primarily because we let them.  I have two regrets regarding this book.  First, I would like to have seen more attention paid to non-criminal psychopaths, but Hare addresses these in a separate book.  Second, I would like to have seen the Psychopathy Checklist he frequently refers to, but he probably witholds this to steer readers aways from engaging in frivolous diagnosis of individuals in their lives 
 Will work fine if you only use a few light coats.  Not designed for a family of four in a colder region.  It's now proped up in the corner as it has lost two leggs and half it's hooks.  Now shopping for a new one.  Looked nice in the oak 
 After book 4 the series begins to meander around.  Characters are constantly side-tracked into meaningless, boring tasks.  The first 200-300 pages of this book are basically a re-hash of the previous books only excitement (Rand's capture and escape from the "bad witches") seen from different characters perspectives.  This is an example of what writing becomes when the author obviously has no idea of where the story is going, and there obviously is little or no editing.  The author must being paid by the word count and not the content.  The story seems to get written into little boxes, and has to be written back on track again and again.  I no longer have the patience to actually read each page.  I find myself skimming through to find some useful information or a single point of action.  The characters have also stalled out with Rand spending most of his time talking to him-self while the world goes to hell.  His big secret plan to quickly deal with one of the forsaken (started in the previous book) continues to drag on and on and on.....  This series had a good basic story.  Unfortunately you have to wade through crap to try and find it.  I'm beginning to wonder if the series will ever end 
 Filmed in 1933, this movie is in black and white, and might be considered dull and slow-moving by today's standards.  An accurate chronology of the six wives of Henry VIII, the characters of the wives are rather  undeveloped, and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important  religious and political questions around which the marriages centered.  A  good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story, but  the serious scholar will want to conduct further research 
 If you are considering this book to find ways to save money with homeschooling you would do better to avoid this purchase.  I was so excited to open this book and learn some new ideas.  What I found were a many educational/informational websites listed that were no longer valid.    In fact, the vast majority were no longer usable.   The rest of the information included was already known.  Don't waste your money or time 
 Social neuroscience is an exciting and important topic of study.  This book does it a disservice.  This book is poorly organized and presents only brief summary of many fascinating ideas.  You might find something that interests you, but you're unlikely to find it in enough detail to get a clear understanding of it.  Honestly I expected better from Daniel Goleman and I was quite disappointed by this book.  Unfortunately I don't yet have a better book to recommend instead 
 This book might have been essential back in 1998 when any goof with a good idea started a software company.  But we've moved WAY beyond that.  Today, anyone in the software business should be able to have written this book.  Its coverage is broad and cursory: development process, requirements management, product delivery, beta testing, pricing, internationalization, and more all in 139 pages (the rest of the book is sample documents).  As an example of how shallow this book is, on page 129 she sees it necessary to define a "byte" as "a single computer memory space."  Please.  If you hope to be a software product manager but don't know what a byte is, don't give up your day job.  The sample documents in the appendices are not bad but they don't justify the cost of the book.  The book contains numerous instances of unclear writing which lead me to believe the book was not edited professionally 
 I purchased this book hoping it would help me show a novice how to start modeling for games. While the author covers the overview and technical terms, the essential modeling instruction is severely lacking. The book talks about creating detail but fails to deliver quality examples.   I bought this title because I own a few of the author's other works including the 3ds max bible. This was a dissapointment because it fails to provide the information on technical skills while it raises false hopes of earning money from games, if folks use this resource. (Read back of book cover)  The up side to this book is in the overview. It does introduce the information and resources needed for the game industry, and it covers the basic concepts of animation and modeling, but does not mention many important pit falls common to many an aspiring beginner 
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 Beware of Spoilers: The story started good and went continually downhill. I don't need a happily ever after, but this ending was too much of a dramatic stretch and the Author seemed to enjoy to punish Jennifer Parker for falling in love with the wrong guy. Some plot points were utterly unbelievable, incl. killing off her son, taking away her friends, killing off her lover and Jennifer's true love Adam, who does nothing much than whining how he loves her, but sadly, his wife just got pregnant....same old, same old. I reckon the story is too outdated to be plausible any more. It was the first book I read from Sidney Sheldon and I am not going to read another novel from him. 
 We all know what we need to do.  Some of us know it better than others, but we all have a certain amount of self-knowledge and a certain understanding of our place in the world.  Caroline Myss seems to think a more perfect understanding of yourself would help you be a better person and to better fulfill your purpose in life. But if it was that easy, wouldn't you already be doing what you know you should be doing?  What Caroline Myss writes will not help fulfill your "sacred contract". Self-knowledge is not the same as power, in the same way as a driver's manual is no help if you don't have gasoline in your car. 
 This sounds very stupid, I'm sure, but I can't get the battery cover off in order to put in the battery. I unscrew it with a coin as I'm told, but when I can't turn it with the coin anymore, I still can't get the darn thing open 
 An adequate book, in the tradition of other Microsoft Press offerings, but clearly insufficient as a sole resource for exam preparation.  Also not nearly enough information to be practical in a real-life situation!  Better  test prep materials can be had from the Exam Cram series.  Another hint for  prosepective MCSE test-takers:  take the Networking Essentials exam last,  after the other core subjects and after the electives.  The material by  then will all be familiar and you won't have to study much of anything in  order to pass the exam 
 This CD has some good songs on it, but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! It's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than I expected. They are mixed together, and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! If you don't mind really short songs, buy this, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise 
 This book had a couple of big flaws. One was that much of the material was superficial and obvious. The other was that it was terribly written, and must have had an unskilled editor. After reading a particularly incoherent "case study" that barely supported the book's thesis, and may have mildly undermined it, I just had to stop reading it 
 There really wasn't much information in this book.  As an adult, you should be able to dress yourself for runs in differing weather but this was the type of information that was contained in this book.  The training program with speed work is essential to lowering your marathon time which is why I gave it 2 stars as opposed to one.  Unless you want the VERY basics of marathon training/running, I wouldn't recommend this book 
 I thought this movie would be fantastic with its all star cast of superb movie stars like Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin etc.  Instead the movie was extremely slow, boring, and drawn out!! It was so bad that 45 minutes into the movie, I couldn't stand watching another second of it. So, I stopped the movie and promptly returned it to the video store I rented it from.  If the movie moved at a swifter pace and was a bit more witty, then perhaps it would have been good 
 Just not funny, I returned the book and got my money back 
 Not particularly interesting or funny. None of the ridiculous turns of language of a Dave Barry column, no elder-statesman crabbiness like Andy Rooney's. Just routine bitching about airlines, office supplies, and so on. Save it for "A Walk in the Woods" or "A Short History of Nearly Everything 
 I did not feel the book was worth the time or money.  It is like an ad for Dale Willertons other services.  Just touches on things and no worthwhile details 
 I ran across this book at a local library and it picqued my interest.  Tipler's theory of immortality, in a nutshell, is the following: 1) the planet earth...and all its living creatures are doomed as the sun will engulf the earth in ~1 billion years. 2) Man will make self-learning and self-replicating machines (can Windows XP do that?) that will colonize, over millions of years, our galaxay and, eventually, the entire universe. 3) These machines will be capable of individual thoughts, emotions, etc and are essentially "alive." 4) As the universe begins to collapse, the machines will be able to manipulate this collapse and prevent total destruction of the universe. 5) All the knowledge possessed by these machines will eventually coalesce into one "super being" at the center of the collapsing universe...this super being is the "omega point." 6) The omega point, via its "all knowledge of all things" will be able make emulations (exact duplicates) of all biospheres, including earth.  Within these emulations, individual humans (you and me!) will be emulated.  Thus we will again be "alive" as these "beings" in these emulations will be unable to tell if they're real or virtual....PRESTO...immortality for all.  The book (theory) reeks of circular logic and assumptions.  It's an interesting theory, but it's just that, an interesting theory by a theoretical physicist.  PS: Tipler denies the resurection of Christ and in  the last chapter admits to being an aetheist.  (I wonder if he's a God-fearing aetheist? 
 The popups in this book were NOT well crafted, they were clunky and didn't always work and with time they quickly cease to function from wear and tear.   One might forgive this passage of time factor were it not for the fact that there is NOTHING imaginative about this book. Its a collection of straightforward boring concepts, nothing new, nothing detailed or exciting, boring boring boring. Do NOT get sucked in by the cool concept and title, this book is a big waste of money.  
 Well, if you want to read the experience from academia, go right ahead. For a better insight, see Michael Beschloss or Ike's own biographer, Stephen Ambrose. This book was a hit in the scholastic arena but never  caught on in mainstrea 
 This book was edited by Hienlein's wife, Virginia.  If you have read Tramp Royale, you will already have seen that Virginia seemed to be a vain and foolish woman, dull witted at best.  This book certainly affirms the dull witted concept.  It is overly catagorized, with many sub-catagories containing only one fragment of a letter.  As a result, a striaght through reading jerks you all over the calender and back again in the space of a few pages.  Very annoying.  This would have been a far better book if the fragments had been presented in the order they were written 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 The costumes and scenery in this version were very beautiful, and I really felt like I was peeping into the England of Charles Dickens two centuries ago; also, this version followed the story pretty faithfully.    In fact, the whole movie was well done except for the character of Scrooge.  I know other people have reviewed this remake and raved about Scott's performance, but I thought it was unbelievably bad.  He was creepy, hissed all of his lines in the same, flat monotone (with a plastered-on malicious smile), and not at any time in the movie, lovable or even understandable as your basic, hard-to-like curmudgeony grump. There's a fine line between the Dickens Scrooge and the one invented by Scott, and the one Scott chose to portray goes too far.  Instead of being bitter, he came off as murderously psycho, and instead of being terminally grouchy, he just about imitated a serial killer.  I did not think his famous reformation at the end of the movie was believable at all.  The supporting cast was all right, but some of the scenes seemed cheesy or forced.  The punk Ghost of Christmas present kind of threw me off.  The earliest version of the story with Alstair Sim isn't perfect, but I'd far recommend it above this one or any other I've seen 
 Super Bark Free didn't work in the least to stop my nextdoor neighbor's dog's extremely irritating ear-piercing loud barking - he merely ignored it (though fortunately my neighbor was good about trying to keep the dog quiet). I'm mad that I wasted a lot of money on a totally ineffective product.  If you decide to purchase Super Bark Free, be sure it's returnable for a full refund if it doesn't live up to its claims. And in the meantime, shop around for a more effective product 
 It is alright to present an alternative point of view, but it is not right to attack other recovery programs, especially those with a proven track record. I suspect Mr. Trimpey has an axe to grind or is just hostile to the spiritual underpinnings of 12-Step programs.The truth is that one size does not fit all. Some methodswork for some people and other methods work for others. Read this book and try this method. If it does not work try another one. They are all good in their own way. But Mr. Trimpey: If one person, who cannot be helped by your method, ignores other options because of your attack on AA, you should be ashamed of yourself 
 I would consider this a book less about journaling and more about writing exercises in general.  I've been journaling consistently for the past 7 years and sporadically for the last 15 years.  I was looking for a book to suggest different techniques for composing a journal (perhaps some real-life examples), unique ways of formatting, and perhaps varying perspectives for reflecting on the days experiences and larger life events.  This book is more reminiscent of an entry level composition course, describing how to draw a cluster diagram, and suggesting writing topics.  Some of the exercises just seemed dull and not related to really keeping a chronology of one's experiences.  If you're just getting started journaling or looking for general writing exercises then this may be your book.  On the other hand, if you're looking ways of extending what you already do or looking for examples of what others have done, don't bother with this 
 (FOR SOME REASON THIS REVIEW SHOWS ONE STAR--THAT OBVIOUSLY IS NOT MY OPINION OF BURTT'S BOOK. I DON'T KNOW HIS BOOK WELL ENOUGH TO RATE IT, BUT LIKE WHAT I DO KNOW OF IT.) I want to add a brief note to Bob Meyer's excellent and comprehensive review. In his important but apparently almost entirely neglected "Husserl's phenomenology and the foundations of natural science" (Ohio University Press, 1989), Charles W. Harvey draws extensively on Burtt's work. It seems that the philosopher Edmund Husserl developed in great detail the kind of view and critique Burtt later offered of the noxious consequences of the mathematization of human experience, the bifurcation into the mind(experience)-world dichotomy. (Husserl was Heidegger's principal teacher, and I recently have come to believe that Heidegger's famous critique of rational-technological thinking ["Enframing", "Gestell"] is little more than a pretentious rehash of his teacher's thought.) I highly recommend reading at least the first few chapters of Harvey's book as an enrichment of Burtt 
 So this page-turning thriller was on the best-selling list for a gazillion months and put Catholic and fellow Christian faithful in a defensive uproar. I'm fairly well read and, yes, I've earned a few bucks with my prose. I'm also a sucker for historic tales, ancient folklore, mythology and Old Testament characters who lived for 800 years and begat like rabbits. OK, I decided, now that it's in paperback, I'll give it a read. What I concluded was this: Those who found The Da Vinci Code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that Brown's work is a literary steaming pile. I read page after page, waiting for the moment when I would start to give a rat's ass about The Da Vinci Code's protagonists. What a bunch of twits. Langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology (I don't know if I spelled that right, but I'm not about to go back in that book and check it). Apparently, there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that Langdon's books sell better than Brown's, entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status. Sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly French chick who's easy on the eyes -- someone a man might make a hit on before the first 300 pages if he wasn't a dipwad like Landgon. She's got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough, but she's been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high-falluting most French probably couldn't tolerate it. And then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic British snob Teabing. From cradle to some approptiately haught estate near (but, of course) Versaille, this memeber of the Royal Lucky Sperm Club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a Euro. So he's been free to pursue his fascination with Bigfoot rumors about how the Priory of Sion, Opus Dei and those cool Holy Grail Knights from the third Indiana Jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that Jesus made a baby girl and God had originally intended women to be in charge of everything. Or something like that. Oh, I forgot, Teabing's crippled so I should feel bad about talking bad about him. Anyway, this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do -- make lofty, self-affirmed pronouncments about how the world's going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag. The point is that these characters aren't very approachable and Brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy Christian faith as we know it. Hell, it's been more than 100 years since Darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution, yet the Christian faithtul still pack churches around world. But back to how bad this book is. Trite doesn't begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase. I would give you some examples but, like I said, I'm not going back in there. One of the more laughable scenes of upper-crust idiocy occurs when Langdon and Sophie meet up with Teabing in his metrosexual parlor. By now, Sophie and Langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times, been on the run and are exhausted. With a straight face, Brown describes how Sophie's delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by... crumpets. Yes, crumpets. Hell, Teabing, shut up about your conspiracy theories, roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat. Offer Langdon a stiff drink. I sure needed one at this point. By now I'm pulling for the albino. Then they escape the jaws of death yet again and, naturally, high-tail it to England on Teabing's private jet. I hoped maybe Teabow would turn back upon discovering he'd left his Grey Poupon behind. I stopped reading it about 30 pages later when it became clear that the Albino wasn't going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists. I don't know how it ends. I don't care. However, there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the History Channel and Discovery. Who knows? You might like it. This is just my opinion 
 This movie comes from John Grisham's novel of the same title. Most of the actions taking place in the novel were also presented in this movie. The spotlight reviews goodly summarize the movie, even when I don't agree with their rankings.  The first movie's problem is the character's personalities, less credible many times. One reviewer well said the FBI's personnel looks rather wimpy.  The merciless Coal Fletcher looks like a simple clerk while he is the real president in the novel. On the other hand, the novel's heroine (Darby Shaw) losses her strong personality but at the same time behaves in obnoxious ways. For example, in one scene, she asks her best female friend to spread a gossip in college but Darby does not care whatsoever for her friend's safety as in the novel; Darby even tells her that "it's not good for her (Darby) to stay there". Darby does all the opposite in the novel. Next, her friend does all what she says, this not credible.  The second movie's error is the way the show the events. For example, as I said Fletcher is not portrayed as a tough way, there's even an scene where we see his seeing his family's picture at his desk, really charming; however he is still punished in the movie. Any honest person who does not let to be impressed by the reputations of the actors and director should admit that the movie is not always understandable. I watched this movie right when released in 1992 and I didn't understand it but the huge Julia Roberts' success was on its highest so I didn't think much, just considered it was sort of boring. Now, I read the novel, watched the movie again and understood the movie was flawed. In fact, all bad guys in the movie were only small fishes who chased Darby.   I also complain that the movie shows some misbehaviour as good ones. For example, in one scene the president asks the FBI chief (Voyles) to stop a crime investigation. Voyles offers to do it in exchange of favours. This is plain corruption yet the movie made it look like a cocktail party! In another scene one character (Callahan) is about to start driving while drunk and Darby only plays a little bit to stop him just to finally let him get on his car.   The movie added a few action scenes the novel doesn't have, yet it is quite boring. The novel has less action, yet it is more exciting 
 Great supporting characters do not always make great lead characters.  Joe Pike is a great supporting character, and one of the things that made him so is the sense of blank mystery he has in the earlier books by Robert Crais.  Demystifying him, as happens to an extent here, makes him less impressive and less interesting.  Elvis Cole, by contrast, is a better lead character than supporting character.  The inner monologue that gives him so much life when he was the center of the book is here absent, and so we trade a lead character for a supporting one, and vice versa, and are worse off for both trades 
 I had to use this particular book for a class I was taking.    I was hoping for at least a balanced presentation, but I was very disappointed with this book.  I found it to have a definite anti-life view.  I found that the author minimized the role of morality in the field of bioethics.  Especially how religion contributes to moral views and how that effects bioethics.    I also found that the author tried to present Catholic Church teachings specifically without even a basic understanding of how the Church developed these views 
 Unfortunately, there's little substance here. Other novels by Phillips are somewhat better 
 Talk about a waste of time!  I was wondering if it was just me so I asked several friends who dutifully read this prize winner and they said they could barely get through it.  It is boring, tells you instead of shows you, hyperactively jumps around the timeline like a flea and provides no payoff at all.  I also found the protrayal of the grandmother's flirtation with Islam to be shallow, un-informed, unbelievable and ultimately dismissive. Don't waste your time on this or your money. Luckily I had picked it up at a book sale for $0.25, about what it was worth 
 Based on the department of a university bookstore in which I found it, I bought this book thinking it was going to be either a humorous essay on Southern womanhood or a sociological examination of the place of women in the "New South". Instead, it turned out to consist of chapter after chapter of total fluff that might have been taken straight out of a 1955 book entitled "How to Use Your Charms to Catch a Man." Come on, ladies, you've moved way beyond this. It's a total yawner 
 Cold Mountain, a place in Western North Carolina is no fun. Life is harsh for country farmers, and cold-blooded locals.  Sure, it's beautiful to look at through the mist as long as you're not starving to death, being raped, or murdered.  I thought I'd let potential viewers know ahead of time before they think they are going to see a romantic period piece for chicks: Cold Mountain is brutal with violence and sexual abuse.  Most of the offending scenes are unnecessary for the telling of a "Saga."  I have no idea why Minghella felt it imperative to show Hollywood blood and skin every other scene.  Well, I know why.  The director has these fantasies and he wants everyone to understand.  A saga is a long story of adventures and side plots that finally climax in a truth so ironic that audiences can't sleep at night thinking of the terrible drama and unrequited love.  Think Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, or Gone With the Wind.  Speaking of GWTW: isn't Cold Mountain kind of a crude remake of that chestnut.  For the most part, Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and especially Renee Zellweger are awful with their dialect; in fact, they are all over the language map, and these inflections kill those moments of human suffering, erupting a giggle to the viewer's throat.  I wonder if the relationship between Zellweger's can-do Feminism and Kidman's old fashioned Southern Belle is a commentary or debate that didn't actually take place for a hundred years.  Feminism is an outgrowth of birth control and Socialism.  Empower the woman and there'd be no war.  All would cooperate as women do as workers.  Men are beasts etc.  You see what I mean.  None of these ideas pounded upon by our screenplay and director would come to fruition for a Century, so why not try to get with accuracy a slice of history.   Recreated, The Crater, a true debacle of history is truthful to a point, but after the Union soldiers are trapped in the hole, did the Confederates jump in too?  I read Bruce Canton's account, and I can assure you the Confederates fired down into the pit with no need for hand-to-hand combat.  The same may be said about the National Guard portrayal.  Films about the Civil War give the impression that every able-bodied man joined the army.  This was not true.  Legions of men stayed home and society itself, law and order, remained for the most part.  Now I won't argue with oral history.  If somewhere in North Carolina, the locals became abusive to their own people: so be it, but CM makes the villains cardboard without character development, so I was left with cheap prurient emotion.  I felt the need to bathe. 
 This is a fine volume of dense anthropological articles.  If the reader is hoping for something along the lines of the excellent Elizabeth Wayland Barber's works, they should look elsewhere. I don't know how it rates as anthropology, but the topics are much, much narrower than 'human experience,' confined to examination of particular ethnic and cultural custom in which cloth (widely defined) is involved 
 I have three qualms with this book:   1. The characters become so painfully annoying over the course of it's 175 pages that, by the time the story has completely unfolded, we just don't care about what happens or might happen to them.   2. The book takes the moral highground. This is perhaps it's greatest flaw; the narrator, David, is painfully opinionated on all that surrounds him. I know this is something that can never be completely avoided in a first-person narrative, but it could have been handled with a lot more grace than what Larry Watson has done here.   3. The story is uninteresting. Not meaning to belittle Larry Watson's talent as a writer, because he certainly has a knack for descriptions of people and place, but we simply don't care about the majority of the events that unfold.   Read something else; save yourself from boredom and disconnection. 
 Maybe you thought Yumi was the main character, but the one to be most admired is certainly Cass.  She is the strong one, the stable one, the woman I most liked.  Yumi turns out to be a pretty crappy mother, among her many other faults.  It was an okay book, but predictable.  Although I saw it coming, the ending did turn out to my liking. Momoko was another undervalued jewel.  In the scheme of likeable women, Yumi (for me) came in a distant third 
 I purchased this book in conjunction with "The Art of Imperfection" - and was completely disappointed with both books. This one particularly was, how shall I say, strange? I was expecting to get something out of this book and received nothing. No mind-opening statements, no inspiration, nothing. I wouldn't waste my money again 
 Does anybody out there need a book to tell them that CEO's, CFO's etc. are greedy?  If you do then this book is for you.  For the other 99% let me save you some money.  I purchased this book knowing Arianna Huffington to be an ecomomist as the cover points out, however the tone of this book is one of a socialist rather than that of a free market capitalist.  She continually gives us news accounts (secondhand none the less) of executives who greedily abuse their power for profit, without any solution other than government regulation.  I bought this book hoping to find some insight as to what can be done, and found nothing but news, with the exception of her continued demand for goverment regulation in this arena.  It seems that her solution to corporate corruption is to have government regulation to "fix" it. Not somthing an American economist would write, well Mrs. Huffington, went to Cambridge.  Perhaps she feels we should model ourselves after the stagnant European economy we passed 25+ years ago as a 200 year old country.   
 I purchased this book on the strength of all the five-star amazon.com reviews.  And having struggled through it, I can only imagine that the author wrote most of those reviews himself.  I suppose readers who never studied the sales processes developed by Bosworth, or Miller and Heimann, or Rackham, may be able to squeeze enough value out of this book to rate it as high as two stars.  But probably not 
 I felt cheated after I read this book.  It wasn't fair to draw Scotty so precisely, yet leave the other characters (his family) so undeveloped.  Did anyone ever explain to Scotty that it wasn't his fault that his mother left?  Did anyone ever consider getting Scotty some therapy with a trained counselor?  Did anyone attempt to help Joan before she left?  Too many unanswered questions and poorly drawn characters left me thinking: "This book could have been so much better." What's the point of breaking our hearts if there was never any real substance to begin with?  
 This woman is no biblical scholar. She does not need to worry. I am sure she will never be mistaken for a Proverbs 31 woman.  Egalitarians make a case that the man is not over the woman in the home--that was a result of the fall. Yet, we wear clothing as a result of the fall; yes, we are under the New Covenant through Jesus, but we still wear clothing. We sin as a result of the fall; under the New Covenant we still sin. Women have pain in childbirth as a result of the fall; women still have pain in childbirth, today, under the New Covenant. Yes, the man is the head over the woman in the home as a result of the fall, and he is STILL the ordained covering, leader, and head over the woman and the home under the New Covenant.  One thing these women such as this author conveniently dismiss is that women will want to rule over men as a result of the fall.  At least this book was worth reading for me (and worthy of one star), because it reinforced my traditional beliefs and made me want to have nothing to do with the egotistical spirit at work in the feminist movement of pride, and power and control. 
 I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore 
 You'll get more of the generic country information that LP is good at (and provides in their various country-specific guides) but we found the research in the Handbook provides a much more informative passage across the time-zones. By far the best and most up-to-date source of information on booking tickets is a website called "www.seat61.com".  Having tried various "tour" organisations, we ended up booking all arrangements through one of the recommended Russian agencies for half the price - all through internet cafes on the hoof in Bolivia!  As for companion guides, much preferred the handbook 
 the kid who wrote the 5 star reveiw is wrong. he needs to go to preschool. first, the pagages arent free, if they didnt come w/the maker no one would buy it. second, this kid says it cant get any better, but it cant get any worse!!!! the 1 star reveiws say to go to mc donalds if you want a mc flurry, but dont go there and support them thats just what they want you to do so they can earn more money!! go to DQ or just make one yourself. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PEICE OF JUNK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
 Sean "Puffy" Combs, Puffy Daddy, Sean John, P Diddy or Diddy.  When he figures out what he wants to be called is when I figure out if I like him.  Meanwhile, there still isn't one good DVD set for Star Wars. 
 it's a fan only! NOT a heater!!! 
 ... But that's not really saying much. At least the main characters are back in this installment of The Sword of Truth Series.  This one has Richard Rahl, his wife Kahlan, their bodyguard Cara and company still traveling through The Old World. Richard's magical powers are failing, his headaches are back and will probably kill him if he can't get to his grandfather Zedd in time to help him. But then a group of desperate people poison the Lord Rahl in an effort to force him to help them, so now it's a toss-up as to what will kill him first - the Army of the Imperial Order, his gift or the poison. Meanwhile, Emperor Jagang (he's the bad guy) is moving in on The Wizard's Keep and things are looking dire.   Okay, It's nice to see old friends again. Zedd and Adie are here, along with Nathan (one of my favourite characters) and Ann and even Chase and Rachel show up - lots of fun there, but since when did simple, straightforward Richard become such a pompous, didactic windbag? The last few books in the series have been growing increasingly preachy, but in the past it has been other characters doing the preaching with Richard as the voice of reason teaching by example. Now, all of a sudden, he's spouting long-winded sermons about the virtues of hate and vengeance - what's up with that? And then there's Betty, the goat. She was irritating in the last book, but she's just a pain in the rear now. Don't get me wrong, I like goats, but come on - lock her in a pen and keep her out of the way!   I enjoyed some of the story in this one - especially with Zedd and Nathan and Chase, but out of 725 pages, maybe 300 were story. The rest is crap. I loved the frist few books in this series and often re-read them, but after the last two (this one and Pillars of Creation before it), I don't know if I will bother reading the last three of the series 
 Bill Adler has taken past interviews, articles, and speeches of Oprah  Winfrey and complied _his list_ of her best quotations. It's an  unauthorized book - meaning Oprah didn't write it nor was she involved in  the production. Some quotations show the source of information with a date  and some don't -- which makes it a bit disappointing not to have the  history or context pertaining to the quote. If you have an extensive Oprah  collection, you'll want this book just to say you have everything,  otherwise there are many other good Oprah biographies available 
 I purchased the Crosley CR-57 in brushed chrome in February 2006.  Less than a year later, it's inoperable and way out of Crosley's 90 day warranty.  Compared to the 1950s Western Electric manufactured phone that Crosley modeled their product from, the Western Electric product lasted for years 
 Inticing beginning, but quickly drops off into the most DULL details of useless information.  Even the ending was dull and in my opinion, and unfinished 
 I was really disappointed with this book - I bought it about a year ago and # of times used = 0.  I was hoping this would be more traditional, familiar meals that could be prepared in 30 minutes, but no such luck.  Half of the recipes have titles that I've never heard of, and most have ingredients that you wouldn't find at your every day grocery store.  I wouldn't even know what would be a suitable substitute.  Nothing even sounds appetizing.  If you were already familiar with cooking, this book may be of more use, but as a beginner looking for some quick, healthy recipes for my new family, this did not work out 
 I thought this book lacked focus and detail. Its basically a collection of thoughts from a number of so called "Pros" who use various methods and comment on what I consider to be the basics. I didn't buy it looking for handicapping advice(which is fortunate it has none)but I did expect some detail about wagering based on the books title. Instead it is a bunch of philisophical ramblings from a few well known handicappers and some who chose not to be identified. You'll laugh,(not really) you'll cry, you'll kiss 20 bucks goodbye. I can't reccomend it 
 There is nothing in this book except the track plans and in some plans it is difficult to find out the square feet required.  Nothing on building the layout.  For $9 you might be able to use one plan.  It's not really a book, it's a phamplet 
 I purchased a tinkertoy set for my grandaughter for Christmas. After only a half hour of play we had 3 broken pieces. By the next day we had six. This was not rough or unsupervised play. I contacted Hasbro and they will replace the 6 pieces. What a disappointment. They must not be using the same wood to make the most recent sets 
 This box is not about making decorative boxes. It is about decorating boxes. There were only a couple of boxes to make. Most of the material dealt with decorating boxes that already exsist. I was disappointed 
 I purchased the backpack and thought the many compartments would be great.  However there is not as much room for documents and folders and I thought.  The padding is great for laptop protection.  The backpack is very heavy and hurts my back when carrying through an airport.The style and look is good function is poor 
 This is one of those rare treats in the literary world that grab your attention, keep you enthralled, and refuse to let you stop reading.  I read this book and literally did not sleep one night because I was too busy trying to finish the book.  But what makes this book so rare is not because of how good it is, but it's because how good everything is until the very end.  That's right, the incredible cop-out of an ending made me mad enough to hate the entire novel.  This is "deus ex machina" in its finest form.  This is unexcusable in my opinion.  I just don't get it.  I just don't understand how one can (seemingly) work so hard on a work of fiction only to screw everyone in the final pages.  I gave it two stars (as opposed to one) for fooling everyone into reading through this book.  This is by far and away my most dissappointing reading ever 
 Am I the only one who read this book?? The Killer's identity is revealed only in the last 20 pages or so. There were no clues prior to that as to his identity, except for the existence of a chat room - out of left field. And why didn't the librarian get more credit in the end in solving the crime?  Also, there was no connection between the drive-by murders and the serial killings. What a long book to slog through, for such a disappointing ending! 
 Susie Stalin aka Medea (child killer) Benjamin is a really disturbed maniac and should be ashamed of herself.  This woman is devoid of any intellectual honesty.  A puppet of the Left she disgraces peace.  As anyone know there is no peace without justice.  Apparently Ms Benjamin would rather live enslaved in a Communist state than as a free individual.  The best I can say about this book is it's comic in its infantile brashness 
 Well, they do scratch.  With a metal fork to turn eggs, they scratch. And though the company claims on their site not to contain Teflon (of course not, Teflon is Dupont's trade name for PTFE), the product is coated with nonstick PTFE - which is known to kill pet birds.  I believe  the government is also researching the health effects on the public from PTFE.   
 Dull, antiseptic, lacking any interesting perspective. At best, you could say this book is like a series of colorless newspaper articles strung together, at worst, a book written by someone so far removed from his subject that he might as well of been writing about extraterrestials.   I wonder if Raab has ever actually met or talked to a mafiosi face to face. This book seems to get all its information from law enforcement souces, prosecutorial types, or other books. Nowhere is there any kind of sociological context that might raise the subject matter above the level of journalism -- and flat, lifeless journailism at that.  For someone so accomplished and genearlly recongnized as an "expert" in his field, this book is a big snooze 
 Paris is organized into neighborhoods called arondissements.  Insight Guides appears to be unaware of this.  Therefore their map are COMPLETELY useless because they do not correspond to ANY OTHER information about the city that is available in any other guidebook, map, book of restaurant reviews, etc.  Why would anyone leave out something as crucial to this city as its arondissements?  Because they're trying to frustrate the hapless traveler unfortunate enough to find herself trying to rely on an Insight product 
 I bought this book hoping this book would provide me `do and don't list' on technical writing, but it did not deliver its' promise, confidently exhibited on the book's title..."How to Write About Technical Subjects and Products So Anyone Can Understand." The contents in the book is good, however, they broadly discuss the `technical writing' profession, not 'how to write....' I suggest author to change the title of the book so it does not mislead readers 
 What's going on here? All year, I've seen dozens of family movies, new and old. Of those I've seen, only two have been worth mentioning. They're actually incredible movies: The Cat Returns and Balto. Going into any family movie now though, I'm not expecting much. Barnyard didn't help that mind set. I'd like to tell you that I was disappointed by it, but it's exactly what I was expecting it to be. For the most part at least. I didn't expect it to rip off The Lion King, that's for sure. There's not a whole lot to Barnyard really, which is bad to say since the first trailers I saw for it almost 2 years ago made it seem like it'd be a cool lil' movie. Originally called Boy Tipping, it looked like a movie about farm animals getting back at humans who tease them on a regular basis. What happened? Well, considering how the final product turned out, I can't blame them for not showing much in trailers, since, like another bad recent family movie- Happy Feet, things get so boring that it's not worth mentioning. Now, don't think I'm some kid movie hater, because I'm not. Not one bit. But I can't see how anyone without vision or hearing problems can enjoy Barnyard. Why did this thing even get A-list actors to provide the voices? Man I hope Kevin James gets some good roles soon...  We start out by meeting the crew of the farm, which is held together quite well by Ben the cow. He's a tall, dark and beefy bovine who takes out the coyotes who try to feast on the farm folk, and has never let a single animal get harmed under his watch. His son, Otis, doesn't seem like he could care much, since he's a young cow just looking to party and have a good time. He and his buddies skip out on a farm meeting just to go hill surfing. One night though, Ben is overwhelmed by coyotes, and passes away, right before his son. Otis is elected the new head of the farm, but thinks he can't handle it, so he goes about his care free ways, and the entire farm turns into one constant party. They even invite pizza delivery guys to the barn (isn't that sick if the cows and pigs are eating pepperoni though?), not caring too much if they get caught. Heck, when the farmer checks in on them and sees them throwing a huge party, they knock him out several times in order to fix everything. This makes up most of the middle of Barnyard, and it's pretty boring with few jokes that anyone will get much out of. Only later on when most of the chickens are held hostage, does Otis do the right thing and head out to save them, as well as deal with the coyotes like his dad before him.  You could take out the entire second portion of Barnyard, and get the same results. The same jokes are used over and over to the point where you can think up a better one before it's even delivered. I kept falling asleep after the opening due to the lack of anything important or funny happening. Even the big musical numbers were dull. You'd think a rat with sunglasses singing Shaggy's "Boombastic" would be great, and I'm sure it would be, just not here. The only moment from the movie that sticks out in my mind is one that almost doesn't even fit in the movie. When Ben's taking out some coyotes, he's holding a guitar, and plays "I Won't Back Down" by Tom Petty. But given that it's Sam Elliot singing, with his signature deep voice, it's an even more beautiful rendition of the song. It's so great that being in this movie almost holds it down and makes me wonder if it should've even been put here in the first place. I guess mentioning the Lion King rip off bit is worth going into a little more here too. A lot of people claimed that Barnyard took what The Lion King had for the main plot point where Otis didn't want the responsibility of being the head of the farm. A minor thing that could be compared to many movies, sure. But the fact that he also doesn't want to because he makes an agreement with the head coyote (who strongly resembles Scar) seals the deal. Honestly, you're better off showing your kids The Lion King again. I also really do feel sorry for Kevin James being stuck in another lousy movie. After seeing his incredible stand up special, Sweat the Small Stuff, a few years ago, I knew the guy was awesome. His tv series is great too, but his lack of any good movie role choices, as far as I've seen at least, has me worried that he could be fading before he becomes a really big name like he should be.  The picture transfer looks like it was taken from a decent VHS copy. Most CG movies made these days get a great transfer to dvd, but I Barnyard manages to fail in this department as well. Lots of out of focus scenes, fuzz and even some aliasing plague the print. The sound's nice and loud though, and those musical numbers sound great (at least, in the technical sense). Lots of use of surround here for about half the movie, which is more than most animated flicks these days.  I remember commercials boasting that the special features were cool. But yet, once again, things just don't go like the advertisements would lead you to believe. The commentary being such a mess wasn't a good sign for how the other extras on the disc would be. It features Oedekerk, Marshal and "The Barnyard Crew", and is all over the place with people talking over each other. Someone could get a headache 15 minutes into this thing. They talk about some technical aspects, little in-jokes and the like, but never anything that interesting, as I've come to expect from Oedekerk. Boogying in the Barn is your standard featurette fare focusing on the band who made the original songs for Barnyard, North Mississippi All-stars. They seem pretty bored about the whole experience, even during the studio footage. Utter Talent is another short featurette that covers the voice actors, big or small. It's kinda sad to see the director praise some of the actors so much when most of them barely had 10  lines, namely Wanda Sykes and Andie MacDowell. Ironically enough, these two get tons of time during this extra, much more than they got in the movie. On top of this, I didn't even know Courtney Cox did the voice of the main female cow, and in seeing that, it feels like a waste of a big name actress. 'seems like she was expecting the movie to do better than it did. Keeping in the short featurette streak is An Animator's Life, probably the most boring of the bunch. The animators are stiff and keep showing differences between character designs that don't look that different. Having been interested in animation and character design for a long time, I didn't think I'd be saying that looking at something like this could be so boring. At least Method Acting With Kevin James ups things slightly- it's just footage of him on a farm with some cows, trying to act like them/gain inspiration from them. We also get about 10 minutes of deleted scenes with optional commentary. They wouldn't have helped the movie if they were left in, and are either in demi-complete animated or story board form. The Nick On-Air campaign is a series of little clips totaling 6 minutes, and are mostly trailers, but I guess exclusive to Nickelodeon. A lot of this footage is repeated from the previous featurettes, unfortunately. There are also the usual trailers, previews, a trailer for the game, music videos, and some DVD-ROM features (mostly games).  Before this year, I wasn't heartless or anything regarding family movies. But after seeing many disasters, and now Barnyard, I could end up being that way unless something fresh graces my dvd player. Some other bad news I just found out, is that there's going to be a Barnyard tv series. Kevin James is left out of it, but I see that Wanda Sykes has signed on. I guess another lousy animated movie claims another victim into going for roles just to get a quick buck. Do yourself a favor and watch something else, or go do some kind of family activity instead. One that doesn't involve Barnyard. I haven't seen Open Season yet, but I can pretty much promise it's better than this 
 While I liked parts of this book very much, it needed editing.  The sequence near the end in Venice was pure agony and I came ever so close to giving up.  However, having read so many pages it seemed a shame not to finish the book.  While the last few chapters helped to redeem the book, all in all the book disappointed, including the apparent tee off for a second volume.  Assuming there is a sequel, I'm not likely to purchase it 
 This is the longest textbook I have in my collection and it is also a bad investment book at that. I know some readers really enjoyed the detailed explanations, but the book was too detailed and wordy for me. Many of the explanations are unnecessary and examples can be simplified to get to the core of the problem/concept and drive at a much stronger intuitive understanding. But this book doesn't do that. It is cluttered with definitions and wordiness that kill the intuition one could get by reading a more concise, straightforward text. A really good book is Investment Science, by David Luenberger. Although his text assumes you have some background in calc/stat/probability theory, the writing, examples, and organization is far superior. You'll actually begin to understand how investment really works, without getting bogged down by the numbers, terminology, and jargon 
 This book is cerainly a disgrace for BRS in general. Unlike the beautiful Biochemistry and Physiology BRS, this Anatomy book is really a disaster at least reputation wise for the BRS.  Yu don't believe me, just buy it and you will NOT want to study from it.  The most crucial thing in Anatomy is a good diagram, but there are few diagrams and they are horrible anyways 
 I was truly hoping this would be the one to work properly, but unfortunately, it did not perform well.  Very disappointed!  I t would not run properly and I needed a humidifier that would run continuously throughout the night.  It would run for a few hours and shut off and nothing I did could get it running again until the next night.   This is my third one in two years, and I am tired of buying these things and they do not work properly, they either conk out, or leak water. I finally invested in a Sears Kenmore humidifier and it is working fine; although I paid a little bit more for it.  They had great reviews from customers who were giving testimonies of having their Kenmore humidifier going on three years. I have spent a lot more on the three before this, so I see this as a way of saving money and getting reliable service 
 This is the only Robert Crais novel I ever read that I didn't like.  I had to push myself to finish it.  It features all the minutia about bank robbing --it's like the author read a book on the subject--  and the least likeable characters he's ever created.    Spare yourself the annoyance of reading this and read "The Watchman" instead.  
 Not very scary, too long, and poor character development.  There are a lot of good reviews about the book.  Maybe I missed something 
 If you are looking for an IPod alarm system this is your machine.  The reviewer comments about good sound quality are on the mark.  But it has one serious design flaw at least for how I wanted to use it and I'm returning mine.  I thought it was a dual IPod/Radio alarm system, as advertised.  It is not.  The radio alarm is only a second alarm, apparently for a second sleeper.  You cannot select between the two options. Tried the work around of setting the second alarm to go off first but you can't not set Ipod alarm so when it (or the buzzer) goes off it shuts down the radio.  Can't understand why they couldn't have worked around this issue but beware if you want choice and flexibility in what you wake to.  
 If you are a college freshman, this book may be useful. For anyone who is out of school, there are many better books available. One that has some depth is How to Survive and Prosper as an Artist. How do I know? I purchased both at the same time 
 I found the plot of this book impossible to follow.  It contains excessively verbose descriptions with a lot of cliches. The hero almost dies twice in a row and is each time magically saved for no reason.  And there are only so many times I can read variations of "he swung his sword really hard" and "it was a really scary dragon."  The illustrations are quite beatiful, though 
 This book should be used as firewood not to entertain or educate kids.  How did the author get it published 
 She does sound like a goat bleating. Yodeling. It's a shame, really. 
 Writing and story were not characteristic of Grisham.  He seemed to write as if his readers could not remember what was just said in a previous paragraph.  Very preachy about the plight of the homeless.  I am giving it two stars because I could actually finish reading it, but I do not recommend this book at all 
 From the cover, it looks like this book might contain 365 tasteful projects.  Not so.  They are so kitchy!  Don't by this book.  You won't like these projects unless you have "home sweet home" wallpaper in your house to go with them 
 I am a Jane Austen fan. I love Pride and Prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel. However, Mansfield Park is Jane Austen's most complex and serious novel, and on the whole it is my favorite. Fanny Price is the most difficult of the Jane Austen heroines, not the wittiest or most beautiful, but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong. She is mentored by her uncle, the righteous and honorable [and I don't use the terms loosely] Sir Thomas Bertram. Somehow, the adaptation of this great novel has twisted Sir Thomas into a sadistic, sexual pervert. Moreover, Fanny is constantly babbling to us in Jane Austen quips that are not part of this novel. They simply missed the point of the book.  The acting is okay. The settings are okay. The directing is sad. But the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste 
 This music is boring. All tangos have the same tempo. No milongas. What a shame! Trying to do routines to this music would be  a waste of time. This CD sounds like background music in a lounge. 
 I have bought 2 seasons of Survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete. Very dissapointing. Guatemala  episode 11 is from a completely different season and it is missing the last 2 episodes and the reunion show. Just leaves you hanging. Exile Island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between Danielle and Cirie for a spot in the final 3 to the live reunion show 
 i expected more from a book called the "definitive edition." the book contains a small amount of useful information regarding useful ghost hunting techniques but the majority of information in the book is essentially useless. i would advise serious ghost hunters to not purchase this book 
 basically... kenny wayne is one of the worst excuses for a blues guitarist ive ever seen. i mean sure hes got a little speed but he's pathetic in comparison to pretty much any other guitarist out there! seriously he can't even solo over chord changes! i've heard him compared to the likes over SRV. whoever thinks that is plain deaf. if you want some real hard hittin blues guitar.. go listen to stevie ray, freddie king, albert collins or johnny winter. i feel bad for any music fan who wastes their money on this cd 
 Everything is fine. Go back to sleep. Nothing happened here, move along. The government is honest. The Warren Report was totally comprehensive and answered all the questions. Believe. Obey. Go back to sleep. Everything is fine.  I did actually read this book. I will give one thing to the author, he certainly did a fine job finding many of the conflicts and contradictions in the "offical" story. Too bad he He didn't explain any of them. It is a fine research tool in that way.   Unfortunately for Posner his attempts to "debunk" are wholly inadequate and unconvincing. In fact this book is so filled with nonsense and speculation it does more to BOLSTER the case against the "Oswald did it alone" story. If it is true that this was a case of the "lone nut" why would the explantions have to be so over-reaching and internally inconsistent? If it was a straighforward case, the the evidence should be equally straightforward and not so convoluted.  The authors "explanations" are unsupported by fact and at times you can see Posner reaching to the point of "I don't even need to prove it, it should be obvious"  If this is the best effort to prove the Oswald "lone nut" story I no longer have any doubt about the conspiracy theory. If the lone nut story was true there would be supporting evidence that was consistent with the real facts, all the facts and not just the ones cherry picked by the author.  Nice try Mr. Posner 
 The opening track is an awesome collaboration with Sting.  I thought that if the rest of the CD was that good, I'd love it. It isn't, and I don't.  In fact, there are only two tracks on this disk I really like.  The only other song I liked on it was the very funny Changing Your Demeanor (who knew Derek Bell could honky-tonk like that?!).  The rest of it just doesn't work.  Tom Jones does such a hammy job of Tennessee Waltz, he ruins one of my all-time favorite songs.  And I'm sorry, but Mick Jagger singing The Rocky Road to Dublin is just wrong.  A rare misfire from a usually rock-reliable group of musicians 
 If you are looking for a "feel good" book about baby boomer retirement, this book may have some value for you. But if you are looking for specific in-depth how-to, this book isn't the answer. Each segment-work, dreams, travel-is short and doesn't address many relevant issues. For example, regarding the work chapter, the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap. Well, that is speculative with globalism. Those jobs may be outsourced. Most are low paying. Many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining. Yes, there may be Wal-Mart jobs but is this your retirement dream? The work chapter sounds a lot like most "Do what you love" books. But doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income. These and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their 70s are not addressed. I could pick apart other chapters in the same manner 
 This product pulls nothing out of the noses of my one year old twins.  We had hoped that it would be easier than manual aspirators but it has proven totally useless.  Unless your child's nose is leaking like a faucet save your money and get the rubber aspirators.  
 I couldn't possibly agree with this writer less.  As a previous reviewer said he spends more time on the album's one misstep "Fitter Happier" than any other track.  And my poor review isn't simply a matter of disagreeing with the author, this is a tedious read throughout.  So little time is spent talking about A) The Music B) The Musicianship & C) The Themes of the album that I really wonder how this series can justify calling this a book about OK Computer.  If you are really into music engineering, on a level in which a total music nerd can't even enjoy reading it, then maybe this book is for you.  Maybe 
 Unless you live in Montana or are very familiar with the State, then this book will be of little use.  Get yourself a good guide book and a detailed map.  Montana is a beautiful state, but this book was not helpful on our recent trip.  And it's a very dull read, in my humble opinion.  Pass 
 Sean sings like Yoko.  To quote another reviewer, "Leave the music to Julian,"  PLEASE!  Does any more need to be said 
 It made my breasts look funny, it made my nipples more irritable & it left painful marks on my breasts. Hardly ever used it. : 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 A thousand blood-thirsty Trollocks are on the way to kill you and your friends.  At your disposal you have the following choices of weapon:  1. The Troll-Kill 2000 which can kill 50 to 100 Trollocks at a time, has unlimited power, never misses, and never needs to be recharged.  2.  A machine gun which is not as effective as the Troll-Kill 2000, but still pretty good, or 3.  A pocket knife, which is great for cleaning your fingernails, but not very effective in stopping a Trollock.  If you are Rand you pick the pocket knife of course, but then either forget to take it with you, or vow not to use it unless you are absolutely sure the Trollocks are not female.    So Jordan has created a superhero with super powers.  He gave the superhero super weapons.  Then he realized that if the superhero uses his power or his weapons there will be no way to stretch this series from 6 books (what it should have been) to 12 books.  Solution:  make the superhero too stupid to use his powers or weapons, and fill the rest of the pages with useless drivel.    The books are filled with darkfriends, and other servants of the Dark Lord, that never seem to do anything, but watch from the sidelines.  They don't really need to do anything, since the good guys seem to pretty much muck everything up on their own.    The problem with creating 1000s of characters in gory detail is that you expect them to actually do something.  The other problem with so many characters is that you loose track of them and lose focus of the main characters.  When Jordan finally comes back to a particular character, they seem to have been placed in suspended animation for the past 1000 pages.  I dare you to try to read this one without a heavy dose of caffeine in your system. 
 Allright, listen:  I will break it down for you country simple.  There is very little actual literature in the world and most of that is not recognized as such.  Why?  Because most of the people who set themselves up as arbiters of literary art have no discernment and bad intellectual character and so are easily bamboozled by writing that reflects to them their own dishonesty and narcissism.  Cobroc McGonigle, or whatever his name is, is one of the writers who will be ballyhooed to the skies by the taste frauds who cannot tell what makes good writing and what makes bad writing.  They just can't tell the difference.  And so they are suckered by pretentious, narcissistic phrase-making and word molesting.  Like for example inventing new words like "candleflame"  And churning out lots of copy.  With pretentious and asinine titles like "All the Pretty Horses."  This is the kind of title a teenager with no talent for writing should have come up with in the process of getting an F in high school creative writing.  Basically, the same people who cannot see through William Fakener will be unable to see through Comrod McDougal, only more so.  William Fakener may as well have been reincarnated as Copran McViegle.  He wrote the exact same type of tripe, complete with pretentious, meaningless titles like "Intruder in the Dust."  You intrude in any dust lately?  Oh, I forgot, I'm just not with it enough to swing with the hip literary fast set.  You know, the fast set that is composed of (not "comprised" of , that is a pretentious mis-usage) middle-aged women with vague but rather humble pretentions to art appreciation who join and promulgate book clubs.  They know they're too dumb to "get" why this stuff is so great.  What they don't know is they are actually smart enough to see that the emperor has no clothes.  
 I picked up this book expecting a nice, enjoyable historical fiction- what a dissapointment! If I had such a depraved mind I would certainly not advertise it.  This book is certainly not one to keep around if you have young children who are readers 
 THIS WAS THE WORST DK BOOK I EVER READ THE ONLY GOOD PART WAS IGNEOUS ROCKS.I LIKE THE OTHER DK BOOKS BETTER THAN THIS ONE  [... 
 I'm a huge Jeffery Deaver fan and until this book had never read one of his tomes that I didn't absolutely love. Bloody River Blues was anything but spectacular in my opinion and it was a struggle to even get to the end.   Character development was fair but not the usual style I've come to enjoy from Deaver. I never really knew John Pellam like an intimate friend and was only given tidbits of information about him. Along the way a few more scraps were thrown out but most seemed unimportant. Subcharacters were also underdeveloped - even the villain was so underdeveloped that when the identity was known it was anticlimactic. One of my favorite characters was the paralyzed cop but his story was often short changed - his doctor could have been developed to give so much more to the story but she never was and it left me lacking enthusiasm for the storyline. And his chanting, nutsy wife could have been fun but again she was almost mentioned in passing and nothing more said.   The main plot was fair but not something that would grab the reader and not let go. In fact, I kept putting this book down and it was difficult to muddle my way through it. The subplots were tossed in with no clear reason behind them. For example, the subplot that has John Pellam trying to sell his own movie script so he can make it into a film himself had me scratching my head and saying, "So what!" I really didn't care and didn't see what relevance it had in the big picture. The other subplots were similar and left me wondering why they took up page space.   Overall this book was just a tad below average but for a Jeffery Deaver book to even be average is a very unusual thing. His books usually grab me from the beginning and I lose sleep trying to finish them. If anything, BLOODY RIVER BLUES put me to sleep! I'd definitely skip this one and read anything else by Deaver.  
 In other book series where the author has died such as the Ian Fleming/James Bond series where Benson or Gardner's name is prominently displayed, or where the author has built such a name for himself such as James Patterson that he can just slap his name on the front cover and it will sell, the one who actually wrote most (or all?), or even some of the book is identified.  In the Tristan Betrayal, no one has claimed credit. And I can see why. But isn't this just plain wrong? Shouldn't the anonymous author own up to his words? For younger people whose only information about the author might be the admittedly good movies The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy, isn't The Tristan Betrayal a kind of betrayal? I think so. It's fraud by whomever owns the rights to Robert Ludlum's name.  Even if this book were good, which it isn't for the reasons well-covered by others below, no one should be allowed to perpetrate such a fraud on the public. And it's not fair to Ludlum either 
 This book is basically a poor product that has been successfully sold. It is terrible. It is a lie! On the back of my book it says "Jazz up your site with 20 exclusive, ready-to-use professional CGI scripts and subroutines--no programming required!" It is sold as if it will satisfy the needs of people who do not understand Perl, while it is almost impossible for it to satisfy anyone, as it is. Hours and hours of troubleshooting and trying to figure out what is wrong is part of what you will get from this book. If you survive through that part of it, you will probably learn that it would be easier for you to learn Perl enough to do things in your own way. Buy another book. Find another way 
 For months, my father has been pressuring me to read this book.  So, I finally decided to give it a whirl...  I'm only on page 14, and I must say that this book is the most boring, worst written, biggest waste of my time masquerading as legitimate science, sociology, philosophy, and any number of other respectable disciplines.  It says in the introduction that "instead of conducting laboratory experiments and competing for federal grant dollars, he (Bloom) put his interest in mass behavior to work by playing a key role in the careers of rock stars such as Michael Jackson and John Cougar Mellencamp."  No...he went into the entertainment industry because he obviously couldn't cut it as a legitimate scientist.  So, he resorted instead to the sensationalism, ignorance, misinformation, and general bad writing between the front and back cover of this 334 page grueling read.    I know that I said I have as of yet read only 14 pages, but on only the third page, Bloom makes the false assertion that Saint Paul originated (no pun intended) the doctrine of Original Sin.  It was Saint Augustine!  Those who believe in Original Sin often claim that evidence for it can be found in the writings of Paul, but whether or not the assertion of any such doctrine was actually intended by Paul (or whoever wrote in his name--as writing in the name of a famous person was commonplace in the ancient world, and it is believed by the most reputable theologians that many of the books of the New Testament, including the four currently accepted Gospels, were not actually written by those persons whose names they bear) can be neither proven nor disproven.  And to assert that Paul was indeed the originator of said doctrine is irresponsible if this book is in fact not supposed to be a profession of Bloom's personal religious beliefs.    I suppose I could say the he simply didn't know any better, but he should have known enough to check his facts before bringing his manuscript to publication.  Especially since this is not a first edition! He's had many many chances to edit since initial publication to sweep his errors under the rug and he hasn't!  Anyway, as any good philosopher (which Bloom obiviously fancies himself) would tell you, if a person gets his or her facts wrong once, how do we know whether he or she is not wrong all the time?    I have skimmed through the rest of the book and have found some very unfortunate things in addition to what I have mentioned so far.  The chapter entitled "Women - Not the Peaceful Creatures that You Think" is nothing more than the musings of an antifeminist, antiwoman carmudgeon who obviously has been burned and spurned one too many times.  In fact, he states such nonsense as "Females are as much a part of the apparatus that triggers male violence as the men themselves" and "Women encourage killers.  They do it by falling in love with warriors and heroes.  Men know it and respond with enthusiasm."  The first part could be stretched to justify violence against women (including domestic violence and rape) by saying that regardless of whether or not women consciously "want it", they are somehow genetically programmed to "ask for it" anyway.  The second part--I don't have anything to say about that.  I think the utter stupidity of it says it all.  Don't waste your money on this inflammatory, yet boring as hell, garbage.  Buy an issue of Mad Magazine instead.  It's more informative, more intelligent, and a hell of a lot cheaper.  I can't help but wonder though whether the great misogynists of our time (e.g. radio personality R.L. and constitutional lawyer/bad author A.C.) are fans of this book.. 
 Predator is the worst book I have read in 2 months (I read a lot of books).  It is too dis-jointed and incongruous and lacks cohesiveness of plot and events.  The characters are poorly drawn (I hardly recognized the Scarpetta and Marino of earlier books).  The transition to reveal the perpetrator was abrupt and weak, leaving me feeling: "HUH??" This the fourth (and it will be the last) book by Cornwell that I have read.  It was totally disappointing and I spent extra time on it just so I could complete it and "Forget about it" 
 "St. Elmo's Fire" is one of those movies that could have been better, should have been better and yet, it just wasn't. It featured an ensemble cast of THE young and hot stars of the 1980s, the so-called Brat Pack (well, everyone but Molly Ringwald and Anthony Michael Hall, who were spared this misstep).  Maybe this was supposed to be "The Breakfast Club - - After College", but while "The Breakfast Club" had characters, even stereotypical characters, that you could relate to, there is absolutely no one, with the exception of Emilio Estevez' character, that you care enough about to relate to in this film. The setting is not the John Hughes teen friendly Illinois, but Georgetown, where our bunch of Brat Packers have supposedly graduated from college.  Uh-huh.  Yeah, RIGHT.   Judd Nelson and Ally Sheedy are living together and supposedly looking toward marriage - - problem is, Nelson is looking at and screwing everything else female that walks by and somehow hoping that Sheedy, in her prim and proper sweater and skirt sets and pearls can change that.  Andrew McCarthy is their mutual friend who knows what Nelson is up to and secretly harboring a festering desire for Sheedy (or maybe it's just the pearls?)  Emilio Estevez is a future attorney, working as a waiter/server and suffering a serious crush on Andie MacDowell.  Mare Winningham is a dowdy, trust-fund type girl who is still holding on to her virginity, working in social services and fighting over marrying the proper dork that her parents have selected for her.  She instead fantasizes about Rob Lowe, who is the pretty boy sax player in a local band, who has dropped out of school, married a white trash-y looking groupie, had a child with her and has now separated from her, and taking up with other groupies.  Demi Moore is the wild chick who works in international banking, has a serious coke problem, stepmother issues and a problem with painting her apartment walls hot pink and with giant murals of Billy Idol.   Sounds promising, huh?  Well, in what is an early portend of the "Melrose Place" to come, Sheedy finds out what a dog Nelson is, dumps his ass, immediately jumps into bed with McCarthy, who is too desperately in love with her to realize that this is a rebound job; Estevez, after screwing up a lucrative house-sitting job by hosting a party there, travels to the snowy mountains to track down MacDowell and profess his love to her.  He finds that she is holed up there with her boyfriend and despite being crushed, he lays a huge kiss on her and then heads back home.  Lowe, in between faux-playing his sax and shaking his feathered head everywhere, takes Winningham's virginity and heads back to his estranged missus.  Moore, after whining seemingly incessantly about her ill stepmother, has all her furnishings repossessed, loses her job and freaks out. Not exactly "The Breakfast Club".   The real problems seem to lie in the characters themselves.  With the exception of Estevez' character, they all seem like caricatures and horribly stereotyped.  Their every action, every line of dialogue seems like just that - - they seem very one dimensional.  Their so-called angst seems like a handy plotline device and nothing more than that. Winningham's character could have been salvagable - -except that she followed Lowe around like a sick puppy, knowing full well how he mistreated his wife and what a basic slacker he was.  And yet, she still gave her virginity to him.  Maybe if Winningham wasn't so bright, or she was a college freshman, it would be understandable.  But she was a college graduate and seemingly intelligent. Lowe really had little to do with his role.  Maybe if he had played the role Nelson had - - as the roving Lothario, with Sheedy waiting at home, it might have gone over better.  With his too-pretty looks, it would almost be understandable how the character could get random women he just met to sneak into dressing rooms with him.  Nelson just doesn't seem comfortable and doesn't pull it off - -but maybe Nelson might have been better suited for the sax player. Moore basically plays herself - -an interesting sidenote is that she was originally fired from this production for her drug problems, mirroring her character - - but was later rehired. While the title song later become a minor hit, "St. Elmo's Fire" itself missed the mark.  
 I have subscribed to "In Touch" since September last year and it's time to renew, but I'm not goint to....because this megazine is never arrived on time (at least 5 of them just failed to arrive), I don't know wether i should wait for it or call customer service. I would go to the store and buy it instead because the megazine itself is very entertaining.   
 I am not sure whatever possessed me to buy this book.  Honestly, it was a complete waste of my time.  To quote a friend, it was not the best use of my entertainment dollar.  If you are a fan of pedestrian writing, lack-luster plots and hackneyed character development, this is your book 
 Pretty poorly written, repetitive, confusing, seems slightly bootlegged and almost too contrived.  The author is too deeply rooted in orthodox Christianity in order to even make a run for the alternative.  I love the subject matter though - that's why I bought this book.  I am slightly disappointed to say the least.  
 This movie creeped me out and not in a good way. Johnny Depp is an awesome actor and I usually find him sexy but in THIS stinker I find him really creepy and gross. Maybe it's the Michael Jackson-ish look he has going on with the black wig and white face. Could they have picked a more horrible look for WW? It looked like they took him to a costume store and put a 10$ wig and 5$ clown makup on him! I love Tim Burton's other movies but this one sucked BIGTIME! It gives a new perspective on Willy Wonka but this Willy is someone I would keep kids AWAY from. This movie is childish if you're an adult and pales compared to the original. If you're a kid it's way too dark and scary and has some adult humor which will leave kids asking "Auntie Zoe, what does that mean?" When are screenwriters going to figure it out? EITHER WRITE A KIDS MOVIE OR WRITE A GROWNUP MOVIE!!! It's really hard to do both in the same film. It seems like when writers try to make movies that appeal to adults and kids, they end up appealing to nobody! Maybe I am biased because I loved the original Gene Wilder version. I would have been open to seeing a remake if it was GOOD but this movie was dissapointing. It's amazing how so much money and effort go into special effects and expensive sets and the script itself is hollow with lousy characters. The whole thing just had a creepy vibe with almost sadistic undertones. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I love Depp and Burton, if you are not a fan of either, don't waste your time with this steaming pile of poo! 
 I've just taken my real estate exam in Illinois, and I can tell you this book is completely useless with the sole exception of the first couple of chapters.  The introductory chapter is good, and the questions to ask a hiring broker are excellent. All that said, that is about all that is good about this book. I'm rating it at 2 stars just because of the first chapters.  Mentions scripts for 50 some odd occasions, and none of the scripts are in the book. Wow, what am I supposed to do now? Obviously, this is just a book going on a good title and providing little if any content.   Read Danielle Kennedy's books and you will a marked contrast in the types of information you are given here. Now some of the information in Kennedy's books may be a little outlandish, but they are not right-out-wrong, or missing entirely.  - Sea 
 I bought this in a haze of holiday optimism, having heard Ms. Aguilera knock my socks off dueting with Tony Bennett on a television tribute show.  There is no denying that the girl can sing.  Unfortunately, what she sings here is banal at best, and downright irritating at worst--lots of gratuitous squealing.  It's a real shame to see a talent like hers drowned by the tide of pop mediocrity.  I reluctantly gave this two stars rather than one in recognition of my age.  Maybe I just don't get it.  Then again, maybe it's just not there for me to get 
 This is an addendum to my review of two years ago.    First off, I mentioned that the book is written on a grade-school level.  Why not produce another edition, with the title "The Depression Workbook for Smart People" or "The Depression Workbook for the College-Educated"?  This may help some of us to feel less put off and alienated.  Additionally, the book is also written from a highly feminine point of view.  The profession expresses concern that more men are not coming forward and seeking help for depression, but I believe many men are not comfortable with many of the suggestions put forward in this book (and many others).  Men are not inclined to take up painting, or knitting, or flower arranging.  We like skeet shooting, NASCAR, and cage fighting. In other words, expecting men to become more like women in order to get well is unreaslistic.  Another suggested edition: "The Depression Workbook for Men." 
 After reading reviews I had imagiend this book to be a master piece.  After received I was simply not impressed.  Many of the photo's focal point was illy placed in the binding.  A lot of photos were blown up to the point of distortion.  None were that breath-taking.  You'd be better off buying a book with photos by Oliver Tollmi 
 "The Princess and the Pea" by Janet Stevens is the retelling of the famous Hans Christian Andersen tale. This time, we get beautiful pictures, reminiscent of Maurice Sendak, and a bland story.  The typeface is an uninspired black Times New Roman, placed unimaginatively at the bottom of each page.  The Plot: A prince wanted to test his beloved to see if she were a real princess. His mother demanded that the prince be sure. Each time the prince met someone he fell in love, she failed the test. One could not play soft music, another ate like a pig, and still another could not dance.  When a rainstorm brought in a young tiger who claimed to be a princess, the queen decided to lay out 20 mattresses with a pea beneath them all. Would the young tiger sense the pea and prove she was a real princess?  The story is all there. The problem is that there is nothing exciting in the language. There is no alliteration or assonance, and no word play. The writer goes through the motion of storytelling without ever bringing the story from her heart into the child's.  Better retellings are out there, and the illustrations, as good as they are, are not so much as to make the book a worthy purchase.  Anthony Trendl editor, HungarianBookstore.co 
 I like Non-Fiction military books and I was looking for battle accounts of the Korean War. This book seems pretty promising with over 100 customer reviews; After reading one review saying the book was a work of fiction, I went to the Library to check for my self before ordering the book.    This is what I found in one of the front pages: "This is a work of fiction. Names, characters, places, and incidents are either the product of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously, and any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, business establishments, events, or locales is entirely coincidental."  Plus I have found the same copy of the book on diferent book stores, some saying "This is a work of fiction" and other don't seem to display it, so My guess is that is a work of fiction.  Just wanted to share it, so if you are looking for a non-fiction book this is not for you. 
 I was disappointed, The audio quality was poor and the instrumentation sparse. I am a fan of Crosby, Stills and Nash, but this is not one of their better performances 
 If you really don't care if a movie makes any sense, and you prefer graphic violence to good acting...then this may be the DVD for you !!! Otherwise it is a complete piece of trash.  Opening scene: A prison bus full of the slimiest, most degenerate criminals in all of Texas (and that is saying a lot) is "rescued" by a gang of murderous henchmen with rockets and anti-tank weapons. Law enforcement officers are butchered and blown to pieces....the prisoners then travel to a Fort Worth shopping mall and take it over, slashing, blasting and pistol whipping innocent shoppers at will. Why they are going to the mall, rather than simply splitting up and completing their escape is never satisfactorily explained.   Soon they are surrounded by hundreds of law enforcement officers, who serve as easy targets as they wander around the parking lot while the convicts blast them with recoiless rifles and gatling guns mounted on the mall roof. In fact, all law enforcement figures in this movie, particularly the FBI, are depicted as complete idiots who are joyously blasted to smithereens by the convicts....it appears that the author of this wretched "screenplay" has a real problem with authority figures.  If all of this sounds like mindless nonsense, then save yourself some time and money and move on to better movies; otherwise, keep reading...it just gets worse.  Mickey Rourke appears on the scene. He has obviously been lifting weights for the last 10 years and guzzling steroids like M&M's....he is positively huge....as big as Arnold in "Conan the Barbarian", and every bit as amusing. Sweaty and greasy as usual, he is the brother of the convict leader (who orchestrated the escape). Apparently he intends to rescue his brother by sneaking into the mall and killing everyone he sees....how this will rescue his brother is not clear, and who really cares??? because it is a great excuse to sneak around and break people's necks with exotic karate moves and stab them with various sharp objects. If you want a meaningful plot, you should have heeded my warning and stopped reading long ago.  The balance of the movie features naked pole dancing, coke snorting that rivals Al Pacino in Scarface, simulated oral sex, multiple homicides, neck snappings, slow gut stabbings, miscellaneous throat slittings, and even a near-death by table saw. Sure....none of these charming events relate in any way to a meaningful plot, but obviously (since you are still reading this review) you could care less. This is a mindless gore-fest from the opening scene to the final, unsatisfying conclusion (which, as a bonus, features the longest, silliest dying scene since Monty Python and the Holy Grail).  If you enjoy such outrageous "entertainment" (and I must admit that I sometimes do) then this may be just what the doctor (definitely not a psychiatrist) ordered. Otherwise, it is pure, shameless trash that should be banned in all civilized countries (even Texas).   
 I purchased a Nikon for my first camera, I just loved how you can take it anywhere, fits handy in your pocket and perfect size. I couldn't wait to take pictures but soon realized that the picture quality was great but as soon as the battery hit low the camera refused to hold my photo's. For my birthday I took over 100 photo's with a fresh battery but as soon as the battery was low all of them were lost. I was so devistated. The video feature is a nice thing too but the quality is very grainy and distorts people's faces. My friend has the identical camera to mine and his camera can have a low battery and maintain all its photo's. So maybe I just got the short end of the stick...but this was my first camera so its okay for starters...but if you love to take photo's be full aware that on a LOW BATTERY that it just might not want to hold them. A major plus I do give this camera is the capasity of capturing a close up image! That I'll give 5 stars to...everything else I'd have to say 2 stars! 
 I ordered this book after seeing all these reviews praising the information on growing with hydroponics and was pretty disapointed to see that there were only 8 pages dedicated to that system. Still I guess it was better than the 4 pages dedicated to growing in soil 
 There are many pages that are just completely wasted. 
 This book is an invaluable aid to those who feel forgiveness is their best way to find healing, or for those whose personal beliefs demand this, but it's too simplistic to work for every trauma victim. Some victims find the pressure to forgive their tormentors to be an additional burden, or an addition to their pain, or an insult to their suffering. Therapy must be tailored to the individual and this method just doesn't work for everyone 
    The quest for the limits of deduction is a well-precedented and exciting topic, and is worth of deep study.  If this is your opinion, then this book is worth glancing at.  Certainly Chaitin's unique approach to tackling the notion of incompleteness cuts to the core of the matter, and is free from the beautiful self-referential chains that bind the reader from a clear understanding of Godel's first and second incompleteness theorems.      Even so, Chaitin's opinions of science, his iconic worship of Leibniz (and consequent condemnation of Newton), his accusative implication that Godel's contributions to deductive logic are overblown and confusing, make this book difficult to read.  On the one hand, Chaitin appears to be a haughty mathematician reaching to mask his low self esteem.  He constantly references his 'teenage' work, and the technical reading that he was able to accomplish at the age of 12.  These comments are ostentatiously interweaved into a forest of exclamation points, and the thesis that he alone understood and extrapollated on Leibniz's understanding of algorithmic complexity.  I believe that this book is very much about an author desperately trying to establish his legacy as a great mathematician, and not just a simple read about the limits of knowledge.  If you can stomach pages of writing from a self-aggrandizing braggart (establishing himself as Leibniz's natural successor in the understanding of information), and have a deep need to understand the notion of incompleteness in a new and innovative light, then I recommend this book only to you. 
 Okay so in the beginning, I was so excited about this perfume.  It smelled AMAZING and the scent lasted FOREVER.  When I say forever, literally forever.  You spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep?  It lasts until the next afternoon.  It's not even just a weak scent that's left on you.  It's like as if you've been spraying it constantly.   But here's the bad part.  After using it for awhile, I felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong.  I felt like the scent was a little too deep.  It's great for people who like strong distinct scents.  If not though, this isn't the product for you 
 I ordered this book through a book club. I thought is sounded like a good book that my girls could relate to - it was terrible!The tooth fairy looks scary, and the descriptions of teeth being pulled are awful for kids!  Children are concerned about losing their teeth, if it will hurt, etc.  These pictures and text only added to their fears!! I read "Love You Forever" by this author, and so I thought this would be a gentle, sensitive tale of teeth coming out - UGH!  Once I finished reading the book, my 5 year old said:  "Mom that is just scary. I don't like it!" 
 Sorry, but unless you are really into esoteric numerology you are going to be disappointed.  I am honestly sorry I bought this; it is not at all my kind of book, but then, sometimes one DOES judge a book by its cover.  If you really want to buy this book, or even if you think you may as well, buy it from me cheap; I'm going right now to sell this through Amazon in an effort to recuperate a few dollars of what I spent 
 I think the Annie Dillard name is the sole reason for this "book" being published.  I write the word "book" in quotes because to call this a book is more than a bit of a stretch.  To me it reads like an old, senile person rambling nearly incoherently about things her mind has lost the ability to grasp for longer than a sentence or two.  I can see only one very general theme come out of this - that people are a product of the earth.  Why does it take 200+ pages to relate that no-longer-new theme?  And relating the theme is all the book does - no explanation, no analysis of the theme, nothing beyond merely stating it in a very long-winded and oblique way.  I hate to be so critical of this work, but I hope to save others the trouble of buying and reading this incoherent mess.  
 The Chinese victory over the USA will make you ask this question.  What's wrong with America?  Thousands of things.  USA dishonors Christ through its sexual immorality.  Look at the rampant pre-marital sex in America.  Don't tell me that America is a Holy Nation or a Christian Nation.  It's not.  China is more pure.  We illegalize homosexuality and forbid pre-marital sex.  China is a more pure nation.  Christian writers don't seem to care about the purity of America.  Mr. Philip Yancey hasn't written one book on it.  I rest my case 
 The Last Seduction, a descriptive title, aptly predicting the plot line of this "thriller," weakens the prelude to a grafter-mission-impossible.  Surly the producer might have conjured a jazzier title.    Linda Florentino is pretty with clothes on or off, one of those tall slim Hollywood gals with augmented lips.  She talks tough and dirty, outdoing her men toys in the saddle, so if the viewer wants some steamy stuff, okay, ya got it.  The problem: the plot is unbelievable.  A good thriller, take Body Heat for example, gives you the steamy romance and a plot device that doesn't intrude.  If the mechanics of the swindle are forced, well, we have only Florentino's next hot scene to look forward too.  Weirdly, Bill Pullman, the smarmy medical student turned pill pusher, Fiorentino's hubby, shines up the plot, keeping it "real" when he is on the screen, which is not often.  A little humor goes a long way in a tragedy.  Just ask William Shakespeare. 
 This book has a few good points, but more bad points. I liked how the alphabet is bolded throughout the book (my 2 yr old identifies each letter right off) and I like the repetition of "Shoo Fly Shoo". However, the book really doesn't have a good 'flow' and I was NOT impressed with the illustrations. The family in the book is haggard and sloppy.  This book seems more appropriate for elementary-aged children. I would imagine that classroom teachers could use it quite often. I appreciate the comment of one person saying, "for those older kids who don't know their letters, this is a more age appropriate book." I agree with that.    After reading the story, I feel like there are fly germs everywhere . .  
 P. Allen Smith's Container Gardens: 60 container recipes to accent your garden Clarkson Potter ISBN 1-4000-5343-9  Yes, you do get in this book 60 reasonably practical container recipes, each complete with a large colour photograph (plants clearly labelled), a diagram of the planted container and list of plants required. There is also some accompanying text which you can skip; it adds very little to your understanding of the recipe. 	About three quarters of the book is devoted to two-page, full-colour glossy presentations of each container design, presented by season throughout the year. 	The remainder of the book is information about potting sheds, plant care and a plant directory. This section is not glossy, not in full colour, and does not relate visually to the rest of the book. In fact the illustrations and much of the text is hidden behind a muddy yellow wash that made me wonder if my eyes were playing tricks on me. I don't know what the book designer/art director was smoking but the result is horrible. 	What you have here is a large format, coffee table book with a photo of a cute young guy (shirt open) on the front. If you need yet another book about container gardening, or if you like to have a picture of a cute young guy gazing dreamily up at you from your coffee table, then by all means buy this book. 
 Folks!! The very purpose of having a laptop gets defeated with this unnecessary add on. If you think you need this then better buy a desktop system and same some real cash.  I do not recommend this 
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
    At the height of socialist popularism in England, cir. 1944,  George Orwell, a leading proponent of socialism, believing in its promises as did many,if not most of Eurpose's leading intellectuals and politicians, wrote a review of Hayek's famous book, "The Road to Serfdom."  Orwell wrote the review in the "Observer," London April 9,1944.    Hayek, mentions this fact as a footnote in chapter 17 of his classic book, "The Constitution of Liberty" published in 1960, as evidence of the disillusionment of socialist intellectuals, when they were confronted with the observation that individualism and socialism were mutually exclusive. Those same intellectuals had not accepted the proposition when advanced by Karl Mannheim in his book, "Man and Society in an Age of Reconstrucion" (1940).  Mannheim had been a long opponent of socialism, but Orwell had only been converted after being exposed to "The Road to Serfdom."  By 1960, when Orwell had become a world renowned author and staunch opponent of Big Brother doublespeak, Hayek recognized that the political proponents of socialsm which was dying as a political ideal, were now introducing the concept of the welfare state.       While virtually everyone alive today have been effected by Orwell's works and his prescient warnings about Big Brother, how many of us are aware of Hayek's infulence on him?       "The Constitution of Liberty" provides its readers with an enormous wealth of knowledge, of which this one footnote is only a small example.  Each reader is bound to be effected in one way or another by the knowledge imparted to them, and this is one of the main lessons to be learned about "liberty" which requires the "rule of Law" to exist in today's society, but that Rule of Law must be understood.  The failure of today's inteligencia is to fail to fully comprehend the meaning of liberty and its necessity in a world full of confusion from the confrontation of competing civilizations.       Unfortunately, Hayek is no longer alive to help guide us through the new millenium.  Fortunately, he has left us a large volume of work, perhaps more relevant today than it was when written years ago.  While "The Constitution of Liberty" is voluminous in itself, it should be kept as a reference book.  Hayek's other works, "The Road to Serfdom" and his last published volume, "Fatal Conceit-the Evils of Socialism" published in 1980 is a magnificent continuation of Hayek's life long discertation on the evolution of mankind's growth from a tribal, familial society which did not require man to understand or protect Liberty, to a group of city-states that prospered because of the Liberties protected in Athens, but only moderately understood, so that such a great and wise philosopher as Aristotle would believe that freedom could only exist as far as a man could yell.    Hayek's understanding that Western Civilization has prospered from individualism, that it has grown and prospered from the freedom to travel, to trade, to exchnge property, material, real and intellectual.  He explains why man must be humble, that humans progress from trial and error, not from conceited belief that one way or another way is correct.  That to be free and liberated is to be free to make mistakes and government should exist to protect individuals'rights to make mistakes while they attempt to profit in their own ideals and beliefs.      
 She has one of the most beautiful voices, and is one of my all-time favorite female singers.  This album is terrible though.  Unlike Agnetha Faltskog, K.D. Lang, and Alison Moyet, who (in my humble opinion)succeeded recently with their "cover" albums (made-up of some of their favorite songs from the past), Olivia does not succeed in the choice of songs, production, and style of singing these 
 I was anxious to read the reviews on this book and I am happy to find its not just me! Her words and sentences are REDUNDANT! Yes "wacky artist" was used about 50 times in the span of 2 pages! Liam picked up a poker and scared the daughter! WE KNOW! Don't tell us 100 times! This is what I think: Either Ms. Steel thinks so little of her devoted audience that she feels we need to be spoon fed the material...OR she's just writing whatever comes to mind and no one is editing. Is D. Steel so popular and successful that no one has to proof read her work? Also, is it cold stone sober? Or STONE COLD SOBER? (it should have been the latter) No editor caught that mistake?  I've been a fan of Ms. Steel's work for 21 years now and the past few year's works have been deplorable! I first excused it due to the death of her son.. But her talent never picked up again. From the Ranch onward the books are just pure fluff. If you want to read a novel and not think about what you're reading...then read her books, this one especially. If you want to read and process and fall in love with characters try Barbara Delinsky, Luanne Rice, Alison Clement, Susan Wiggs.. 
 Extremely disappointing and not worth the price.  I was so angry when I saw it and I showed it to fellow knitters who all told me to return the book to Amazon.  The patterns except for the cover are very ordinary and the book has so few pages that I could not believe how I was taken in.  Word of advice, don't buy this "book" 
 Rules of Thumb has a neat layout and odd size that makes it a great coffeetable book. Unfortunately, that's not what I was looking for.  This is not a book for specifics on the craft. The 73 notations by published authors in this book are everything serious writers will hear at writing meetings, conferences and critique groups. They are, in some cases, inspirational, but don't offer the specifics new writers need for structure and development. This might work as a nice, general gift if you have a friend who is a writer and you don't know which books on structure they might like. If you are a serious writer, I recommend spending cash first on Plot and Structure by James Scott Bell. It's much more specific and incredibly witty 
 My daughter received this for her 5th birthday.  She has some ballet experience so we thought she would pick up on this rather quickly.  Only one portion of the DVD is really instructional-And that part is FAST FAST FAST!  Did I say Fast?!  Thank goodness for the rewind feature on the DVD--             This music is redundant--but that's ok--my daughter loves it.  She so wants to follow & do the dancing but there is little to no actual step-by-step instruction.  It's basically several cute bubbly girls dancing away on a plastic numbered mat.    On the upside--she still loves her microphone headset & singing along.  This product could easily be improved by adding chapters with varying difficulty level so as to allow younger children to catch on.  The label DOES say 5 years & up 
 I really wanted the famous sea poets and authors: Masefield, Tennyson, etc.  What I got was some of that, but interspersed throughout with the anthology editor's own poetry -- which I'm sorry to say, isn't that great.  And the editor doesn't appear to know much about sailing either; for instance, he totally misses the nautical meaning of the line "when the long trick's over" (Sea Fever).  A trick is a turn at the wheel, standing watch, silly rabbit!    Serious sailor-readers should find a different book 
 This is the second worst book I have ever read! The first, being the authors revisionist barf about the featherweight irish! He writes with the dexterity of a blind bull elephant in a China shop. The chapters have no order, and are incoherent, and he does not sight his sources. An Eskimo knows more about the Jewish people than this crude clown. Read Isaac Asimov and Abba Eban if you want to learn the truth. 
 Call me shallow, but, from the cover of this book (a whimsical, illustration with an equally whimsical font), I thought, being unfamiliar with this author, that I was in for an Anna Maxted/Shannon Olsen type of read. (Sorry if I spelled the last names wrong). I do like reading novels of substance, but I felt that the cover design on this novel completely misrepresented the content. I am disappointed. I am (substance or not) perplexed by the novel's structure and not too interested in the gazillion characters presented (there are too many for my taste!). Also, I felt like the fact that Nora kept commenting on the fact that there were "too many characters" and "no plot" in the protagonist's stories were just excuses for putting in too many characters and failing to develop a plot. It's probably just all way over my head. I can tell the author is talented, it's just not my speed 
 Almost unbelievably bad, except I saw the remake of 'Shaft,' which should have been a forewarning.  This is like a comic book for filmgoers.  No, not a graphic novel adapted to the screen.  More like a comic book for kids, that you'd be embarassed to own at any age.  Doubly offensive is the high quality soul music that is on the soundtrack, a travesty to the nth degree.    
 This book is the worst book ever. I didn't know there could possibly be a book this bad. If you are required to read this book like me, i feel bad for you. Do NOT read this book for pleasure because it is not a pleasant book. It is painful to read. If you are STILL thinking of reading this bad book, DON'T READ IT!! take my advice. 
 This book does not cover the new exams that have been revised as of September, 2002. Don't bother, wait for the next release 
 This book has some interesting tests to take-- how romantic are you?  How much do you know about Sex?  How aggressive are you? I was hoping to learn more about myself by taking these tests.  The results on some tests are difficult to calculate.  But once you muddle through and find your score - you are not really given a good explanation of what your results mean.  It tells me very little about myself that I scored with the top 10 percent of those taking the test.  I was hoping for explanations of what my answers say about me.  This book lacks any deep thought-provoking explanations about your answers.  I was hoping for it to say something about my personality.  I was looking for more explanation into who I am based on the results of the tests.  This book lacks the "that's interesting" factor from your test results. I was a bit disappointed by that. I took the tests and it seemed to reveal very little about the real me.  
 Other than for the stars that were in the cast, I never would have bought this DVD 
 I am very interested in this kit but have questions that I am sure others will have.  Are the stamps mounted with wood?  What size are the individual stamps.  Are the definitions of the each stamp scripted on the stamp?   Thank you for you answers.  Trici 
   This book was a disapointment for me. I am going to vacation on the northern California coast this Fall and was hoping to learn something from this book, but it is mostly just the well worn mainstream information that doesn't need retelling. It completely omits the area I'll be and the areas it does cover are handled more effectivly in other books. The pictures are great, though 
 where can i read about this beef and how this release is shady? Ive been looking everywhere and also trying to find the real dr octagon on myspace but there has been nothing. someone please help... thanks! 
 These speakers do not work with the laptop I have. More specifically a Dell latitude D410 with docking station. it works with the just the laptop, but not through the docking station.....whacked!!!!!! So I dont know what they sound like yet???? beware that they have bugs!!! 
 Generally, MS-Press Self Paced Second Edition books are good. Especially they did a great job on 290 and 291. This book, however, is an exception. This book does not cover many exam areas at all, and I am not talking nuances. There is no mentioning in this book about PKI certificate archival (new feature in Server 2003 family, well tested on 293 exam), or the GC placement, and several other areas. Those subjects that are covered in the book, are not covered in depths, in fact, they look like poor summaries and will not prep you for the exam in any way, nor will they prepare you for real life situations. Author jumps around same topics and is not able to clearly explain most of them. Practices are not worth installing a fresh copy of Server. There are no good "Exam Tips", like in other MS-Press books. I doubt that Craig actually took this exam.   I understand that no exam preparation book alone is enough to prepare for the exam, but those that I read so far, did a pretty good job on it. I was able to ACE several Microsoft exams using Self Paced guides and Testout videos.  This book tried to trick me into thinking that 293 exam was peace-of-cake. It is not! Do not be fooled. Exam is probably as hard as 291. It may seem easier after taking 291, but without that preparation 293 would be close to impossible to pass for the first time. Yes, it is in some ways similar to 291, but it covers whole bunch of different topics, and focuses on a different agenda. This book will not help you pass the exam. Book is a joke. 
 The best thing about this book was its brevity - only 138 pages long and thankfully so.   This is the story of a college student's journey into an obsessive relationship with her professor and his wife.   It wasn't very well-written; their relationship was obviously quite intense but the writing was anything but. Written in a different way, this could've been a real page-turner. But it wasn't. It was just lukewarm at best.   I wasn't endeared - either positively or negatively - to any of the characters; I felt altogether disconnected from them and the events of the story.   The ending was quite good however, so this wasn't a total loss. But I'm not sure I would ever read another of her books (though her writings under the pseudonym of Lauren Kelly are good) and I definitely wouldn't recommend "Beasts" to anyone.   
 We bought "the series."  What we got was Season 2 complete (unless any were originally 2 hours in length); the pilot tv movie McCLOUD: WHO KILLED MISS U.S.A.? bearing the syndication title PORTRAIT OF A DEAD GIRL; and three 90-minute "movies" each compiled subsequent to their original network run by frankensteining two random, unrelated one-hour episodes of the show's first season - which ran under the umbrella title, 4 IN 1 - and cutting each set of two episodes by 30 minutes -- with the result that some guest stars were entirely cut from the mix!  For those studio executives who don't understand the concept, nostalgia means we want what we remember viewing...the way it was...not frankensteined into phony movies.  If Universal had any integrity at all, they'd gather that pilot with its original title sequence and the unedited, original 1-hour network versions of these six episodes...with the 4 IN 1 umbrella sequence...and at least offer to sell this to us in a nice slimcase to replace their careless disc 1, season 1.  I supposed next we'll have to beware of COLUMBO and other MYSTERY MOVIE 2-hour episodes being released edited down to 90 minutes to conform (and yet being sold as "The Complete Season! 
 If you've never read any well written and insightful books on technology adoption (such as Lewis Mumford's "Technics and Civilization") then perhaps parts of "The Change Function" may appear profound.  However if you had, then this text will find you wishing you had spent your time and money elsewhere.    People won't use technology that's hard to use? Profound.  People only learn a new way to drive to work when the old route is under construction? Brilliant.  Coburn goes way out on a limb to predict what technology will succeed...are you ready? Flat screen technology and Blackberries (mobile enterprise email). The man is a psychic.   On top of the lack of anything remotely fresh in this book, reading The Change Function is a bit like reading a version of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations; except the people being quoted are not familiar to you...unless you are one of Pip's blog friends, who receive endless attributions throughout the book.    Please save your time and money. Re-read Telecosm (Gilder) with an eye for how so many actual predictions (not like Coburn's Monday-morning QB stlye) were wrong.    BTW - I predict hybrid cars will be big in the future 
 Bought this Platinum game with much anticipation and it doesn't work at all.  Tried the download .exe patch and does nothing and to top it off half the original game forum sites crash too.  No one has any idea how to fix this game and all you have to do is look at the dozen of patches out on first game.  If they had spent the time and money to build the game and test it right like Blizzard does and companies like Westwood was then they would release a finished game but decided to use everyone as gunea pigs to test the product so they could try to patch it to work.  DO NOT BUY ANYTHING from this company or its affiliates I think they are Alkida implants trying to take over the western world. If you want to play a game with style then wait until June and get "Titan's Quest" which should be finally a Diablo 3.     Too bad this company couldn't find the capital to complete the game before release and would think anyone wanting to buy Spellforce 2 should be warned upfront to make sure you wait for about 6 months after release and buy an additional hard drive so you can download the new Patch fixes they will probably try to smoke screen you with as they count their money and send it to Iran 
 If you are looking for a book that does a cover to cover job of bashing western civilization with complete and obvious bias, this is it. 
 As a recent Econ Major from the University of Washington, I found the book outdated and inconsistent.  It had the nauseating sense of a political polemic dressed up as an "economic treatise."  I can only agree with a handful of his "realist" conclusions.    While reading Eat the Rich, I found the first few chapters on theory semi-humorous and the rest of the book dry, just like most economics texts.  Apparently the dismal science is humorless by definition.    As for Mr. O'Rourke's so called libertarian credentials, I would like to revoke them after reading this book and his romance pamphlet for the U.S. military (called Peace Kills).  Just because you are a member of the Cato institute, doesn't mean you are a consistent libertarian.  In fact, it probably makes you an inconsistent one.    Obviously I have more complaints, so I will save us both time and just relate one more.  Why would you seriously treat Albania as a capitalist country?  Then call it anarchist?  It seems that P.J. has a bit of an axe to grind here.  If he would have just looked at the Fraser institute's study on economic freedom - he would find Albania ranks number 91st in government regulation of business, 74th on protection of private property and 69th on the relative (taxed) size of government out of roughly a 100 countries.  Obviously Mr. O'Rourke hasn't done his research very well (or his empiricist radar was turned off) if I was able to do a similar analysis in a few moments without going to the country in question.  How can the 69th largest government be called "anarchist?"  I am truly puzzled.  (After looking at some of the recent historical data - I wonder if O'Rourke was asleep while writing this chapter.  I have been generous with my numbers for the former Communist country.)   All seriousness aside, I liked P.J.'s earlier stuff better, most notably "Parliament of Whores".   He is much funnier and seems to be more at home with politics.  Yet, from what I have seen, he is writing another book about economics - God spare us.  If you are truly interested in learning Economics - try Gene Callahan's "Economics for Real People." 
 I thought Keegan was a "serious" historian.  This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a "serious" miltary analysis of the iraq war 
 Very hard to understand, if you can read, understand and enjoy this book at all you could probably give the boys a hand in Egypt with the Hieroglyphics ........If you enjoy scientology well this one's for you!!!!!!!!!!

 I bought this book this weekend as we're doing the pre-five in a Row w/our preschooler and I don't much like it. I've got a mother w/borderline personality disorder and who doesn't observe personal boundaries of other's what-so-ever (if I need a break away, she hunts down my poor husband, all my relatives and friends- ugh) and so this book just kind of made my stomach turn as I could see her reading this to me and justifying her 'stalker mom' mentality.   In the end, I think if a person is from a semi-normal household w/proper respect for a child's boundaries and need for space away from their parents, then this book is okay. I just find some moms are too smoothering- even ones w/o personality disorders- and this book doesn't send a message about love as much as 'I own you'. I like 'Mama Do You Love Me?' better for explaining to a child a parent's unconditional love.  'Good-Night Moon' by Margaret Wise Brown, however, is by far my children's all time favorite book. I was reading that one to them ineutero and still every night before they go to bed. They love it and so do we as parents. But this one even creeped my hubby out and he's from a fairly 'normal' family. Take it w/a grain of salt 
 While the author certainly has insights and interesting things to say about the city of Mumbai, his style of writing is nothing short of painful.  Sentences are carelessly constructed.  Topics bounce from one topic to another on every page, sometimes within paragraphs.  Many sentences don't make any sense at all and words are often used incorrectly.    I read this for my book group and found it to be a real struggle.  I found myself irritated with the author from the outset and a bit astonished that this book, that has been promoted so aggressively, did not undergo a much needed edit before going to press.    The author strikes me as young, over-eager, and in great need of settling down and focusing 
 I received nothing of sailing value beyon paying attention to the local tide tables, along with ebb & flood flows... The story was interesting on how two fellows of different social levels were able to enjoy time on a small boat.  The ending left me empty and unsatisfied.  If you are from or sailed the North Sea area of East Friesland (Germany), it will be most interesting, because of the detailed maps of the area.  Looks simular as seen from GoogleEarth map 
 Okay, the script is not the most imaginative I've ever seen, but I like the actors (especially Ben's best man) so I was friendly with this movie for the most part.  I didn't even mind the obvious holes in the plot, such as...why do these characters not have credit cards or cell phones? Or at least, why don't they use them?  Oh no, much more plausible that Ben will have to strip dance in a gay bar for $150 to buy a car to drive to NC.  I didn't even mind the fact that the whole "We're married and my husband's a doctor." charade was so predictable. Oh Gee, he's pretending to be a doctor and he's on a tour bus with a bunch of elderly people. D'ya think someone might have a heart attack and "Dr. Holmes" might have to step up?  And uh, they're pretending to be married and Oh! surprise there's the best man and maid of honor! D'ya think they're gonna get busted?  What killed it for me was that ridiculous ending.  It was obviously supposed to be a surprise (and it was) but there seemed to be no other reason for it than to pull a fast one on the audience.  I felt cheated. I spent the entire movie getting emotionally involved with the relationship between Sarah and Ben, and I really cared about how they would handle things with the fiance and Sarah's little boy and all that.  I cheerfully became disengaged from the relationship between Ben and Bridget, I totally believed neither one of them was ready to get married or right for each other.  The film spent an inordinate amount of time showing me they're not right for each other and that this wedding was not meant to happen.  RIGHT UP TO THE LAST MOMENT, we think he's breaking it off with Bridget. Instead, what the heck let's just go ahead and get married after all.  Huh?  He left Sarah sitting out there waiting for him in a HURRICANE!!! after making her promise that she would still be there when he got back.  This man obviously doesn't have a clue what he wants in life, and I'm expected to believe they lived happily ever after?  Not only that, but what does it teach us about taking this commitment seriously?  It teaches us that if our instinct is telling us "don't do it!" and our genitals are yearning for someone else and even Mother Nature seems to be working hard to prevent this marriage, aw heck go on ahead and do it anyway.  It's just marriage. It's romantic! You could get lucky and live happily ever after!  It's been my experience, when things aren't feeling just right as you approach that wedding, turn and run. The last thing you should do is close your eyes, grab your balls and take the leap 
 I have only glanced inside this book searching to see if there is a proper treatment of relativity. I was glad to see that no mention of relativistic mass is made, kudos for that. However, a few other sentences caught my eye.  On pg 32, it is said that a 1 kg mass is equivalent to 3 x 10^16 J from E = mc^2. Ok, I have made simple math errors before (though not after being reviewed by a publisher and the likes of M. Gardner et. al.) On page 56 it is said that for a particle at rest the inside of the square root is zero (within the dilation factor) when it must be one. Hopefully I was "lucky" and just happened to catch the only two glaring errors but it makes me wonder who proof reads such works 
 *See how easy it is to throw bombs at people? I'm glad people express their opinions and have differnet views, even though it pisses me of a lot.    *But, one reviewer used the analogy of Rush listeners to Hitler Youth members.  That is such a cop-out, easy, thoughtless, and inflammatory statement.  I should know.  I used that analogy countless times in school, because it is easy and powerful. The problem is that it is almost always untrue.    *Wake up, people.  Support what you say with facts, instead of swill 
 I am one of the many reviewers who purchased this DVD because everyone favorably compared it with "Seinfeld," and (not being an HBO subscriber) I had never seen it. Personally, I found this show boring, repetitive, and often grating. Well, that's just me. You might be among the many people who enjoy this genre of comedy. Deciding if this DVD is for you will require an informed assessment of you own taste.  Buy this DVD if you tend to laugh at protracted bickering among the characters (as in "Married with Children" or Vicki Lawrence's show "Mama").  This is NOT the kind of gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering that we once enjoyed in "All in the Family." As in "Seinfeld", you will see adults act in childish, selfish, irresponsible, uncaring ways. Depending on how this is done, it can be VERY funny, but "Curb" missed the mark for me. I find self-absorbed New Yorkers (as those portrayed in Seinfeld) to be funny, but self-absorbed Californians (as in "Curb") are just pathetic, not even laughable. You might feel differently. Neurosis and rudeness are backhandedly ridiculed in "Seinfeld", but almost celebrated in "Curb." The characters in "Seinfeld" are roughly half a generation younger than those in "Curb." The Seinfeld characters (who came of age in the "me" era of 1980s ) commit a variety of hilarious middle-age gaffes and mis-steps associated with a lack of direction in life.  The older characters in "Curb," on the other hand, offer us only a repetitive and uncreative barrage of antagonistic behavior that is characteristic of people who have given up on forging new directions in life. They merely exist. You might find this funny, but I found it depressing 
 Although the poems are beautiful... and I certainly don't mean to bash Whitman with this 2-star rating... it's the wrong book. NOT AS ADVERTISED. This was supposed to be the original 1855 edition. That's what I expected, and therefore (in my mind) what I was paying for. The original 1855 edition, according to modern literary analysis, was the "strongest/purest" version. It was the true starting point of Whitman's own (and consequently America's) poetic awakening. Consisting of just 12 "perfect" poems, it was THAT edition which Emerson praised so highly.  Whitman never put out another book... just revision after revision, addition after addition, and edition after edition of Leaves Of Grass... until you wind up with "the deathbed edition" which is a severely bloated and different work from the original.   I was very much looking forward to a slender volume of the original edition. Which is what the item description says this is. It's not. Be forewarned... it's the Deathbed Edition of 1892... nearly 500 pages. And frankly, there are MUCH better versions of the deathbed edition. Sturdier versions with nicer pages exist (this is a pretty weak paperback, printed on pulp pages), with better footnotes and more authoritive introductions. Shop around.   To sum up... the 2 star rating is because lying about which edition this is, is a terrible way to sell the book. Whitman was fantastic and the poetry contained in the book itself is first rate. It just would have been nice to get what I paid for. The "true" editon, written by a YOUNG Whitman at the height of his powers.. 
 What can I say about the truly inspired film "Havoc" that hasn't been said before?  Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award winning documentarian, taking a grittily realistic look at urban youth dabbling in gang culture--sounds like a recipe for success!  Add a talented cast of appealing up-and-coming actors given really meaty roles--awesome!  Not so much...  "Havoc" is, unfortuanately, an unmitigated disaster.  You won't believe your eyes.  The kids, the gangs, the streets of L.A.--everything just rings so false.  The last time I saw so many posers "playing" street toughs was at my Junior High auditions for "Grease".  And I think we could have taken these kids.  A lot has been made about the "shocking" sexual content of the film.  Anyone "shocked" by this movie probably doesn't see very many movies.  Anne Hathaway does appear naked, which seems to be a selling point, but she and everyone else deserves better.  I'd actually have rated the movie about a 4--because it's a campy mess!!!  If someone had realized that this was a B-level exploitation flick, and sold it as such--I'd have bought into it.  No, though.  This is a "serious movie" and "important" document of our time.  Sadly, on that scale, these kids need to go back to school because they failed 
 This piece was not one that I ever would have chosen to read myself, but was instead introduced to it by my 11th grade English teacher.  It is not a work of literary genius, but is instead a simple story of explanation created by the ancient Sumerian people about the lives of their gods.  Similar stories exist today such as that of Santa Claus to explain the appearance of presents under the tree Christmas day.  The characters are presented as ordinary and their thoughts and actions are on the same level, if not below, that of the average person.  They make mistakes that portray them as entities to be learned from, but not mimicked.  When the god of wisdom gets drunk and gives away all of his greatest possessions it makes me wonder about the earlier definition of wisdom.  Family is another subject that seems contorted.  If this story was meant to enclose life lessons why is Inanna presented with the "gift" of prostitution by her father figure, the enlightened god of wisdom, and then murdered by her sister.  Another aspect of ancient life that was revealed by this composition is the common occurrence of infidelity.  Inanna has only recently married and slept with Dumuzi when he tells her that he would like to sleep with other people.  If Inanna, a goddess, can only entertain her husband for a short time, how long would an average woman last?  One further aspect of this story that irritated me was the constant repetition.  I understand that it was meant to stand out from the rest of the text, but there are other ways to drill important pieces of information into the mind of the reader.  This story is a good tool for looking into the past and discovering the thoughts and beliefs that were held in ancient times.  I have learned about a new style of writing, gained some insight into the Sumerian world, and enjoyed a good, if simple, stor 
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 There are two problems with most Church Administration books: 1) As soon as they get specific with business practice they become irrelevant for those who live in a different business or legal climate (i.e. all those outside of the USA); 2) They often try to justify every single administrative or business practice undertaken by the Church with a biblical example. This leads to horrendous 'proof-texting' and shaky theology.   Unfortunately, this book succumbs to both of these issues. Proofs texts are often utilised which more often than not are subjected to an eisogetic allegorical hermeneutic. With this flawed hermeneutic God's great act of intervention and deliverance in the exodus of Israel from Egypt is reduced to an example of business planning (pg 15), the Holy Spirit is a supervisor in the divine 'reporting system' (p29), and the prophets are feedback agents (p29). The frequent misuse of passages referring to the 'administration' of grace or spiritual gifts (1 Pet. 4:10; Eph. 3:2, 9 [as though these verses were 'really' about business administration]) demonstrates a suprising lack of linguistic and hermeneutical ability on the part of the authors.  In this reviewer's opinion, it seems that books such as this would be served better by building their adminstrative practices on a simple basis of stewardship rather than trying to force the Bible to mandate every single contemporary business practice. The writers should stick with their gifts (administration) and leave the biblical scholarship to someone more qualified.  However, once one skims over these painful sections and gets to what the book is really supposed to be about (administration and not biblical theology) it is fairly solid. My main criticism is that it is a little too focused on the specifics of the American church 
 There is nothing practical about this book. It is a looooong, purely theoretical torture with only a few examples that don't work too well in the real world. I had to buy it for one of my graduate classes and here I am three months later even more clueless than I was when I started. This book is very boring, painful to read. It doesn't help that the author is clearly biased in favor of traditional HRM and refuses to give much room to more modern thinking. The exercise book is a nightmare. The exercises are either impossibly difficult and time-consuming because the textbook does not offer valuable guidance for any practical problems, or they are an absolute waste of time - students basically have to copy a chapter. I could go on like this forever. In a nutshell: buy this book if you have to, but sell it as soon as you can 
 This book deserves two stars for the message and zero for the messenger. The middle-class is indeed in trouble, but not necessarily for all the reasons Lou Dobbs offers here. It is interesting to note that as host of CNN's "Moneyline," Dobbs was a champion of the pro-business policies that have in great measure led to the pain and suffering of the middle-class. We can fairly ask when Dobbs suddenly "discovered" the middle-class; it seems to have occurred shortly after he discovered the immigration issue, when it was pointed out that many of his guests on his "Broken Borders" had ties to hate groups. Dobbs had to discover the middle-class as a facade around the immigration issue, as a cover to the fact that he was allowing people with ties to or were in fact members of white supremacist organizations to frame the debate.       Dobbs may sound "reasonable" when speaking to Al Franken on Air America, but his written words leading up to the 2006 elections are that of a xenophobe and bigot. Going from the pro-business extreme to the other has naturally led to some confusion on Dobbs part, and one wonders if he is ignorant of the racial aspect of his views or is the slickest snake oil salesman on the planet. So much for the messenger       Beyond that, one thing is for certain: after all these years as being the "expert" on the market, he never seems to have left Wall Street long enough to understand the reality on the street that he now claims to speak for.     One of these realities is than in the "good old days" Americans were over-compensated, and the bubble burst when high priced American-made goods could not compete with low-priced foreign-made goods. The result was lost manufacturing output and lost jobs that never have been replaced to any significant degree, and what new manufacturing there has been have not replicated the same wages There may have been an opportunity to arrest this development if there had been the will to reinvent domestic manufacturing in line of the new realities, but domestic output was ignored in favor of military construction during the critical years of the Reagan administration. Unlike post-WW II, this military build-up did not replicate the level of domestic manufacturing expansion.     Now, it is business executives who are over-paid, and although it is interesting to speculate how many jobs can be created if a CEO compensated $20 million a year makes just one million less, or how much it would increase workers' wages, the fact is it wouldn't be much. Wage redistribution would have to extend beyond the upper class into the "yuppie" class whose best skills seems to be moving paper and talking. By the same token, even if the nativists are correct that "low-skill" immigrants depress wages, we're only talking cents, not dollars--which would hardly propel low-wage workers into middle-class status.  Would raising minimum wage a few pennies do the trick? It is insulting to make such a claim, and furthermore studies have shown that for every 2 percent raise in the minimum wage, one percent of low-income workers are laid-off.     There are myriad other reasons why wages are depressed, such as out-of-control healthcare costs.  But in any case, for Dobbs this is all secondary to the immigration issue, which is mendacious if only for the reason that he is playing a xenophobic political game without accknowleding uncomfortable realities. It is easy to blame businesses for hiring undocumented workers, but the fact is they wouldn't be if they didn't need to, and current immigration law makes it almost impossible to obtain that labor legally. Much of the work that undocumented workers do is seasonal, migratory or otherwise require some measure of mobility, which most Americans are reluctant to do even if housing and transportation was provided by employers. And these jobs certainly do not provide a path to middle-class status.      Having staked his credibility on assaults on Mexican immigrants in league with known racists, Dobbs was a big loser in the 2006 congressional elections, no matter how mendaciously he tries to spin it as a "victory" now. "Populism" and nativism are not a mix recognized by progressives; if he thinks so, then Dobbs is an even more irrational demagogue than any of us may already suspect. 
 I like a few other readers was excited to start this book after reading so many great reviews... what were they all thinking?? This book was so boring and the back and forth between then and now was painstakingly slow. The main character was so unlikable, as a child and as an adult. Her fascination with her brother Matt, was not fully explained, and really all the characters could have been written better. The layout of the book I also felt was badly edited. I literally had to force myself to finish it because I figured I'd already spent so much of my time I figured I had to know the end. What a let down.... I found it way to corny and anti-climatic. Seriously, if you're on the fence about this one, keep on searching. Leave this book alone, you'll be doing yourself a favor 
 I've read all of Hamilton's McKnight novels and this one is the worst.  It took me well over 300 pages to get into this novel and by that point I'd spent so much time reading the book I just wanted to be finished and done with.  I've thoroughly enjoyed all of his other novels but this one just seemed to have no purpose, couldn't grab my attention, and was just a painful read.  If I wasn't such a fan of his earlier books I would have put this book down after the first 40 pages.  I still own this book but wouldn't put anyone through the torture of reading it.  If you have yet to read the McKnight series read his first novel, A Cold Day in Paradise, it's a classic mystery.  
 This has to be one of the worst books about Christianity that I have ever read.  Strobel pretends that he is telling us the 'evidence' from a nonbiased persepective, but in reality everything is stacked against us from the get go.    There are no other opinions other then Christian scholars throughout the book.  One chapter is named "Rebuttal Evidence" - but no, it's not what you're thinking.  What it is Strobel picking the 'Jesus Seminar' out of the headlines and then going to one of their opponents to talk about it!  I don't think so.  Was Strobel so scared that if he offered at least a tibit of outside view points that the Christian audience would be over challenged and scared off?    Then we have the talks about which interviewed scholar debated which atheist and won.  One, so what?  Two, why are we not actually hearing from these men and women ourselves instead of through a third party?  It is a subtle trick to make the Christian argument look stronger, instead of just laying out both sides of the evidence and letting the reader actually decide.  Then there are Strobel's questions.  Oh, dear God! Here he is, with some of the most reknown Christian bible scholars and all he can think of is some soft, under-boiled questions that can be easily refuted by these acomplished men.  Strobel claims to be an atheist while he was conducting these interviews.  You never would have guessed it.  Agnostic desperately wanting a reason to be Christian is a more accurate description.  Stay away from this book if you have self respect.  There are plenty of books out there that address Strobel's material in a balanced and fair structure.  And by the way - one is never going to have evidence for God.  That's why it is called F-A-I-T-H!  If you sincerely need a book to hold your hand and cloud your eyes in order to believe in a creator type being - then by all means buy this book.    Otherwise respect yourself and other humans and steer clear of Strobels material as an accurate representation of the arguments.  Whether Christian or not. 
 I've read five of the nine "Temperance Brennan" mysteries that Kathy Reichs has published, but this is my least favorite. I lost interest about two-thirds through. I felt the villains were not fleshed-out, the murder mystery too complicated and unlikely, the ending too neatly contrived, and the personal/romantic side story too awkward. This one was also too long, by about 50 pages. Reading it felt like eating a stew in which there were a multitude of ingredients, yet they did not blend into a successful flavor. The other four of her novels were fine. I love the TV series as well, although "Bones" allegedly shows Dr. Brennan much earlier in her career, with the supporting cast and the job duties and locations totally different than what is found in the books. In the TV series, "Dr. Brennan" has a steady cast of supporting characters who grabbed my mind and heart very quickly. In the books, her lesser characters all seem...lesser, indeed. Better luck next time out, Dr. Reichs 
 This book is OK, but considering how many books are out there on this subject, I'm amazed at its high cost.  Unfortunately, my professor chose this book for our class, so I need to get it.  On the positive side, the book is available at our library so I will just photocopy the needed articles without having to actually purchase the book.  Professors, please think about the cost of the books you require your students to buy.  This kind of price gouging in the textbook market has to stop 
 Roche's translations of Euripides' tragedies are intrusive.  He adds stage directions and characterizations that influence how the reader views the people in the plays.  Readers may believe that these stage directions are from Euripides, but most of them are not.  I find it irksome having to differentiate between Roche's interpretation of character and Euripides' text 
 I give this book a 1 star not because it wasn't interesting - it certainly was, but because the ending absolutely floored me!  Aghgh**&&*(7#!!!!!  I never thought it was going to end like that - where was the justice??  I feel like something is missing.  I want to reach into the book and smack Alex! Please tell me there is a follow-up book where Sam gets what's coming to him!!! -- Oh, and Daphne too 
 I watched this movie and it sucked,very slow.It might be a renter not a owner 
 This book seems to be emblematic of the problems many technical textbooks suffer.  Whole chapters and series of chapters seem to be there just to take up space.  Entire sections of redundant or extraneous information, or no information at all, can be found everywhere.  The useful information in this 1400-page book could probably be expressed in 100 pages.  It would be much easier to understand in that format as well, since extracting it from this morass is nigh-impossible.  Useless drivel is expressed in tedious detail again and again, while actual useful information is in one or two obtuse sentences that are easy to miss or misunderstand 
 i was amazed that you could take such an innovative TV show from the 80's and make it into such a boring movie. Action was slow and predictable. Casting was horrible. Even the cars weren't as good as in the TV show. I am glad I only rented tis and didn't buy it. Don't waste these 2 hours of your life on this flick 
 I bought the 13 block set about a month ago and now over half of the knives are rusting. Mind you, I only hand wash and dry. Regardless, this is very embarassing for dinner parties. These are just NOT quality knives. I wasted $120 on them please do not do the same. 
 North Country has a few things going for it and plenty against it. The magnificent photography and gritty settings give a rare view to the forboding Iron Range in Northern Minnesota and the script and performaces by major-league talent have the best of intentions. Unfortunately, the sum of this film is less than its parts. The storyline is simply too familiar and cliched - even the run-down town and factory settings smack of "Silkwood." The backstories of spousal abuse, family dysfunction, and (gasp) Lou Gehrig's disease are right out of a "Lifetime" movie.So are the "dramatized" scenes of a labor meeting and the tepid courtroom confrontations.  The perfomances are mixed: while Harrelson walks thru his role with one eye on his paycheck, Theron - "uglied up" yet again - has her eye on Oscar. She scored an undeserved nomination for this role as she fails to convince on all fronts.   The best performances come from supporting players: McDormand is excellent as the ironically named Glory who is beaten down the the Union and by life. Spacek is equally effective as Theron's Mother (she played a similar role in "Marie" in 1985). Overall worth watching for the scenery and supporting cast 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 I'm not a big fan of this novel; I feel like instead of using specific character experiences to mold its unique story, it really capitalizes upon the context of the story. Its setting, native american reservation post WW2, is certainly a fertile ground for all sorts of social commentaries.    However, the tone of the novel is set mostly by the main character's incessant depression and post traumatic stress; you can't blame a war veteran for being traumatized, but this tone makes everything slightly noticeable in the novel of great exaggerated importance because, hell, it could somehow refer to war or the suboridination of the native americans.   All of the action in this book occurs before you open the first page. We get glimpses of Tayo's life in the war, which would have probably made for a much more interesting, revealing, enlightening, and emotional book. I feel like this novel is very dry and not of much consequence.\  If you're not being forced to read this book through school, then don't waste your time.  After pages and pages of non-events occuring in the desert wasteland, you'll wonder what made you pick it up in the first place 
 I bought this book for my fiance hoping he could have a little fun with it. We've decided to return it pretty quickly -- while it starts our funny enough -- it quickly denegrates into non-funny jokes that indicate that there is NOTHING positive about getting married at all (meeting her parents -- no matter what her mother does means she's coming on the the groom). I expected a book of humor with some practical advice on how to get through it -- I found some humor, but nothing worth keeping.  
 I so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book. I read it recently for a book club selection, and let me tell you, If I didn't have to read it, I would have put it down after the first twenty pages, and never picked it up again. I found it to be dark, depraved, disgusting, and depressing! An examination of love in all it forms? Hardly! These characters were just plain goofy. I finally figured it out towards the end of the book, these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually. They were looking to other humans to provide them with true love, and that is just barking up the wrong tree. I am giving it one star only for the rich use of language 
 Gilles Kepel's ultimate message in this book is clear: the Western democracies should not exaggerate the threat of Islamic terrorism because it is on the decline. This, however, is far from certain. Kepel bases his analysis , and his conclusion, on a very small amount of evidence gathered from a few Muslim countries. He has , as might be expected, no access to the internal debate of the various terror organisations that operate throughout the Muslim world. Another problem is that Kepel does not seem to understand the importance of such traditions as " kitman" and " taqyyiah" in the Islamic culture which make it incumbent on the believer to hide his real beliefs and feelings whenever and wherever he senses that the general environment might be hostile to him. The fact that Kepel, who seems to know a little bit of Arabic, has no knowledge of Persian, Turkish, Urdu and other major Islamic languages is a further handicap as the bulk of the ideological litrerature of terror is curently produced in those languages, and not in Arabic.

 Our daughter received this for Christmas 2005, and we couldn't wait to open it for her.  It is very easy to assemble, and the first time you write on the board it's great.  When you try to erase your art, it won't erase!  The magnetic board is cheaply made, and absolutely will not completely erase, no matter how many times you swipe the eraser bar.  We were VERY disappointed with this item, and would recommend that if you are considering this toy for your child, you should pass.  Get them a Magna Doodle instead, those work wonderfully 
 This CD was given to my son as a gift, and after one listen I got rid of it.  As a professional musician, I'm sorry, but I can not stand to listen to the people singing.  They are terrible, and the arrangements of the songs are even worse!  My son, who loves music and loves to dance, wouldn't even dance to this one.  It's like he knows it's bad!  If you are a musician, or have the slightest sense of good music, trust me --- you don't want this CD.  There are so many other CD's out there of good music sung by people who CAN sing 
 This book was so-so. It contained a lot of highly basic material. I was not really impressed with Dr. Loehr's theories about sport. It seemed that he did not have much access to sport himself. The examples that were given were very modest and could have used some help. I would only reccommend this book to someone who has rarely particiapted in sports...too basic for the advanced 
 I would have returned this book but by the time I paid shipping it wasn't worth it. There is very little in this book of use, almost all of it is outdated, tools and equipment, etc. There are much better books on the market. This one might have been better if it wasn't so old. I have been an architect for 25 years and there just isn't anything in this that is useful. Very disappointing 
 A rather disappointing compact version of the much better larger format Larousse dictionary. I bought it for travel purposes, and was alarmed at how many French words I encountered on signs, in newspapers and elsewhere which were not in this dictionary. If you're serious about the language, this pocket dictionary is less than satisfying. Even for casual references, I found it less than helpful 
 I loved "on Mexican time" and visited San Miguel partly because of the book. I find it interesting that an american writer who was lucky enough to move there before the flood of expats has the cajones to complain about the current state of "his"town. After all, isn't he partly responsible for the popularity of the town 
 I read the other reviews here and was compelled to add my two cents.  If this is the best out there in instructional video for ballroom dance, we really need to change that by begging those polished, thoughtful teachers out there to PLEASE create something for the dedicated desperate students seeking decent instruction!  Not everyone has access to top teacers in their home town and something has to give.   This dvd was disappointing at best.  The skill level and grace of the 'teachers' seemed totally lacking.  They seemed to stomp through the mechanical indications of the various steps...but there was no style to be seen.  I am not suggesting that an instructional video needs to showcase the narcissistic vanity of some performer teacher; but a nice clean basic technique should be essential.    Common sense also seemed to be lacking in this presentation as well.  When there is an able bodied woman right there, why does the the male teacher need to demonstrate her part????  I found this frustrating to watch.    Overall:  don't waste your money on this one.  The cd included with the dvd also falls short of the satisfactory mark.  It is outdated and reminds me of elevator music 
 The contents of the book are OK if you already know Java and want to quickly brush up. There is too much assumed to just pick this book up as your first Java certification book. My major complaint is that there are numerous errors in the question and answers and on the CD's practice exam which is the main reason for buying. It is very frustrating to look at a list of answers and feel that none of them are correct or to look for a third when only two are - you find yourself doubting your knowledge and then, doubting the rest of the book's contents 
 I saw Jerry Lee Lewis and Kid Rock perform "Honkey Tonk Woman on the tonight show with jay leno last night...It was a laugh,especially Jerry Lee's wheezy vocals,especially as compared with the robust Kid Rock...The way the song was structured was also a hoot,sounding nothing at all like any other version I have ever heard(and I have heard plenty,from the travis tritt country-rocker to a reggae version by billy swan)...I heard this album of duets today...It stinks...Sure,jerry Lee is an Icon,but he's in his 70s,his voice is weak,and he should be at home resting on past laurels rather than making believe he still a youngster,and matching tonsils with people who still have some wind in thier lungs...The duet craze,begun way back when with Frank Sinatra is begining to become ridiculous,inasmuchas now it would seem that any entertainer old enough to have ever been a star gets to do one of these things..Like the"tribute"albums of the '90s,these duets items are usually vanity pieces,allowing today's performers to couple with some geriatric old superstar,even if the resulting sides are embaressing to all concerned...None of the stuff on "last man standing"is worth the price of admission...all of these sides fall flat... 
 I am going to return this book and get my money back from the authors. Hey, they offer in writing in the book.   Your best source of what you want is from you. Your best source of information is from recent brides. Know what you want first and then figure out how to make it happen. New brides are more than happy to give advice and tips. Another plus is that new brides still remember how important it is for you to have your own individual wedding. New brides will give recommendations and let you talk out what you want, and then they will get the heck out of your way.   If you are recently engaged then you have probably already started to hear many people tell you how should do things, what they would have done, and their expectations of your big day - all with varying levels of intensity. This book is more of that.   If you really are short of available recent brides to talk to then go ahead and read the book. Keep a saltshaker handy because a few grains are required to digest their advice. These poor authors who are so unpopular with the wedding industry, woe is them. How much do you want to trust a book that so whole-heartedly promoted one gown store and bashed another when their pet store is filing bankruptcy?   Yes, it is true. This book's pet bridal gown store, Discount Bridal Service (DBS), is going out of business, filing bankruptcy, and leaving thousands of brides without dresses. Their least favorite store, David's Bridal, is still in business and still providing dresses to us brides. (Plus you can try on dresses that fit and bring your camera!)  PS - A true source of information are event coordinators of any type. I got great information from hotel Sales Managers and various churches. Even though I was just getting information about room blocks or just inquiring about the wedding ceremony the Sales Managers and church Wedding Coordinators/Alter Guilds had great advice and could give me five recommendations each for photographers, florists, and bakers. This gave me a great start on looking for those kind of vendors. 
 I have always wondered about Professor Chomsky's writings. He has always been described as mean-spirited and anti-American by the right. I finally got an opportunity to read his book Hegemony or Survival. I was surprised at how readable it was; I expected it to be overly verbose. I was also surprised that I actually agreed with some of what he had to say, particularly about Iraq. He certainly is correct that the US led invasion of Iraq was a fantastic opportunity for Bin Ladin to stir up anti-US sentiment and attract members to his terrorist organization. I don't think you have to be a professor to see that though. Although some have charged Chomsky with being sympathetic to terrorists, I failed to see this. He condemns terrorism but accuses the US of creating an atmosphere that is conducive to the growth of terrorist organizations.  He argues here that US foreign policy victimizes every country it interferes with. The US consistently brutally punishes any country whose actions are contrary to its agenda, even if that country is just trying to better itself. Without a doubt, the US has made some disastrous foreign policy decisions but I don't think Washington is as evil as Chomsky wants the reader to believe.   We Americans like to believe that the US is always the good guy riding in to save the day. Sadly, all too often US intervention harms the very people we believe to be helping. Having said that, the US is not the evil monster that Chomsky portrays it either. He asserts that the US has only one goal and that is global dominance and it is all done under the guise of fighting terrorism or fighting communism. Too often he appears to use fuzzy logic or cherry picks events so that he can apply this contention to various skirmishes the US has been involved in.   On page 9 he states "In one country, Nicaragua, Washington had lost control of the armed forces that had traditionally subdued the region's population" "The us-backed Somoza dictatorship was overthrown by the Sandinista rebels, and the murderous national guard was dismantled. Therefore Nicaragua had to be subjected campaign of international terrorism that left the country in ruins" "The spirit of exuberance, vitality , and optimism that followed the overthrow of the dictatorship could not long survive as the reigning superpower intended to dash the hopes that a grim history might finally take a different course"   What Chomsky chooses to ignore is that after the Sandinistas overthrew Somoza with the full support of the US government, US then made initial efforts to establish peaceful relations with the Sandinistas. Congress authorized 75 million dollars in aid and offered to send doctors, nurses and teachers to help stabilize the new government. The Sandinistas got into trouble not by ousting Somoza as Chomsky wishes the reader to believe, but by supporting the Marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. The US cut off aid and gave repeated warnings to stop providing support to the communist rebels. In 1981 the US even sent Thomas Enders to try to end the tension. He offered them a sweet deal, the US would completely leave them alone to do as they please if they would just stay out of the conflict in El Salvador. They refused. This is was the beginning of the end for the Sandinistas.   I don't understand why Chomsky implies that Nicaragua was on the course to some utopia either. The Sandinistas promised their supporters free elections but refused once in power. They consistently denied Nicaraguans the freedoms they had promised, newspapers were censored, religions suppressed. Some ethnic groups were terrorized and their villages destroyed. The only reason that I can think of that Chomsky would paint such a distorted view of the Sandinistas is so that he can lead the reader to a false conclusion.  Later Chomsky implies that the US ruined the healthy economy of Nicaragua. Any economic growth that the Nicaraguans experienced was due to the US because of the said aid and the efforts of the US to have their World Bank debts forgiven.  Chomsky wants the reader to believe that US conflicts are never about communism or terrorism, that its just a ruse. He's wrong, nicaragua is just one example of where he got it wrong.  I also wonder about his comments concerning Cuba appealing to the UN for help. Chomsky states that Cuba didn't respond to the US with violent attacks within the US, rather they followed the procedure required by international law. Chomsky appears to be implying that the noble Cubans were above the primitive barbarity of the US. Obviously they didn't attack the US because they did not have the means to launch a formidable attack. Keep in mind that after the Cuban missile crisis, Che Guevara, one of the most influential leaders in the Castro Regime was furious. He was angered that the Soviets were weak and pulled the missiles out and proudly announced that he would have launched them all given the opportunity.  Chomsky's claims that Cuba's economic woes are purely a product of the US embargo seem to be a bit of a stretch. Did the embargo negatively impact Cuba? Of course. So much so that their island is the now the equivalent of tropical slum despite the fact that every other country in the free world will trade with them and they get billions of dollars in aid? I fail to see how.  I am troubled at his comparison of the 911 attacks and Clinton Admins attack on the pharmaceutical company in Sudan. Why didn't Chomsky mention that it was in response to attacks on US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania? Why didn't Chomsky mention that we believed it to be a chemical weapons plant? Why didn't Chomsky mention that the US released 24 million dollars to the businessman whose factory we wrongfully attacked?  I have numerous other concerns about the authors claims but I've reached my word limit here at amazon.  Cheer 
 First I rated it great and it was, for two movies. Then it broke and the picture was scrambled and rolling. The end. 
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 We are traveling the US for almost a year and have purchased the East as well as the West edition before we started. Besides the fact, that we found only a few nice spots described in those books so far, our comments are as follows:  1. The contents of both editions are outdated - certain camgrounds do    simply not exist any more for years!! 2. The directions are awful if not wrong 3. We spent more diesel on finding the described campgrounds than we saved     not to mention the hazzle, driving around in circles 4. Lots of directions seem to be copied from other books we have and are    as wrong as they are in those 5. Campgrounds indicated in the maps by numbers (icons) are not part of    the book anymore 6. The icons in the maps are close to impossible to read (use a    magnifier)  Overall we can absolutely NOT recommend those books to anybody 
 I was disappointed at the dismissal of social scientific evidence in favour of a priori conservative christian observations about deviation from an a priori normative basis. Disturbingly, this seemed to be on the basis  that some forms of cult or new religious movement had too much in common  with fundamentalism's own authoritarianism, failure to respect intellectual  freedom (or "relativism". However, how else is one meant to  assess whether an NRM is harmful or not? Gomes fails to realise the  implications of social scientific or psychological studies that do show  such correspondences between authoritarian NRMs and fundamentalist  Christianity, while harmless and non-authoritarian religious traditions are  also included in this series solely on the basis of alleged philosophical  deviation, and no other reason. I don't think anyone outside fundamentalism  will be impressed with the latter criteria as sole basis. Moreover, it also  suffers from the relativist strawperson argument. And if the NRM is  politically conservative, it is interesting to note how much of that gets  let out of the Zondervan series, compared to liberal alternative religions  such as Unitarian Universalism 
 I must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee.   The narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details, but also historical background.   Because it's an autobiography, I don't necessarily think that it's fair to damn the book for being self-centered; it IS about him.   I do feel, however, that the book needs better editing and a bit more self-examination.    It's an okay addition to one's list of books about Everest expeditions - which I must admit, I've developed a morbid fascination with after recently re-reading "Into Thin Air".   I wouldn't, however, use it as my primary source for information or impressions 
 When I bought mine there was no reviews. I have the same problems as the other reviewers have. Feathers poking through. I was suckered by the low price. Stay far away from this product 
 I am interested in losing weight due to Type 2 Diabetes. This book is about emotions and feelings of overweight people. This is probably a good book if you have emotional issues. For me, it is simply BORING, and not at all what I thought it was. If it were not so inexpensive, I would return it 
 brian de palma doesn't just rip-off hitchcock in "obsession" he steals the body. this might as well say "a vertigo remake"    cliff robertson(a fine actor wasted here)isn't as watchable as james stewert was and really the "mystery" of this "piece" isn't a mystery if you think about it for one second. stick to "vertigo" and see the way this film should have looked 
 i've mostly been into the ultra.trance series, but eventually moved away from it when i started hearing songs that were so 'ghetto' that they couldn't possibly be categorized as trance in the first place, let alone wind up on an album who's main sales pitch is trance music.  the same thing has happened with the ultra.dance series....and for some strange reason more trance tracks have appeared on this album, which probably means the dj's that compile these selections don't really know what they're doing. typically in the ultra series collections, you don't see the really good dj's compiling the stuff (like oakenfold/van buuren/tiesto). instead we get wannabe disc jockeys like the riddler, vic latino, johnny vicious, etc...that seem to all want to get mad props/recognition, and in the process of striving for fame, they lose thier credibility by intermixing generes/going off on a tangent of music on an album that's supposed to feature only one genere of music. for ultra.dance 06 i can cite 3 or 4 different generes of music that this album touches. and for those that like dance but not hip-hop/r&b, they will have put up with it, because these "amazing" dj's felt those songs had to be on the playlist.   but when looking at new compilations that come from these 'big time' dj's, including Louie DeVito (who's compilations i gave up on at least 2 years ago), the trend i've noticed is how they have this magic ability to select songs that just sound real bad. for example, 'Out Of Touch' (disc 1) sounds like it was compiled in a garage using a 386 and compiled twice over using mp3 encoding. seriously, some of these songs cannot be played loud on a high end system because they sound like trash. but if you people keep on buying into it, then you support the garbage.  despite all this bashing, there were a few good songs on this album. but i've basically had enough of the ultra series. i would say if you like this album, you would like the 'trip in house' series of albums better 
 I bought the cd three weeks ago and I still do not have it. Whatever you do, don't buy from amazon because they cheated me out of my own money. The description says, usually ships within 2-3 days. I could see being off with five days or so, but this is insane 
 The prose is well written.... BUT that's it. Few insights that can be used in practice for people who aspire to become future leaders 
 Miller rates a par for the book (if that's damning by faint praise, so be it) but the ghost writer, editor, and publisher should get a DQ (disqualified) for the effort. The misprints, factual errors, bad grammar, and typos detract to the point of cancelling out anything good Miller says. I wanted to like this book because Miller himself is so likeable and his TV commentary is so good,but thanks to the poor production value it's as hard to enjoy as a triple bogey. For instance,two questions: did Seve win three times on the PGA tour(pg 202)or six times(pg 203)? And how do you hit a ball with the clubshaft perpendicular to the ground? To do that, it would have to be dangling from your hands like a plumb bob. Maybe Johnny can demonstrate that during the rain delay at the British Open 
 Sat down and saw this one on televion.  Only good service was that now I know buying the DVD would be a waste of money.  What was actually achieved by the British is portrayed as an American achievement. Slanders the U-boat men portraying them as heartless marauders. Other than allied Propoganda pieces, There are no incidents of U-boats machinegunning people in lifeboats.   The movie itself I have little respect. Basicly Plotless and  unrealistic. Action scenes unbelievable. Characters Two Dimensional.   This film Awful. 
 As fair as studies aids go, this one is not very good. While concise and simple, the book really lacks the aid aspect. This book is like buying a textbook and reading it. In addition, I felt it times it wasn't very useful. I would read the UCC (especially 2-207) material and feel like I wasn't any better off than when I left class. I would buy instead the Emmanuel's and/or the Emmanuel Flash Cards if you want a stronger study aid. Unlike those additions, this book lacks the useful charts and acronyms that help when you're trying to remember the series of questions to ask yourself on the exam. In essence, if you are going to buy only one guide, and you don't need a second textbook, don't buy this one. However, if you haven't been going to your first year classes this is a good book to buy 
 I found this book to be easy to read, but severely outdated.  The author also took a very alarmist stance that treated pregnancy as an illness.  I would have preferred a more balanced view like what I found in Pregnancy for Dummies, which is a very good introductory book.  I would NOT recommend this book 
 Frustrated authors take note, you can be published and you don't even have to worry about little details such as punctuation, sentence clarity, story, structure or grammar. Cormac McCarthy proves it eloquently with "All the Pretty Horses." Had McCarthy ever bothered to revise this draft he might of had a story, however he just cranked it out of his typewriter or computer put a stamp on it and shot it over to some publisher, who was either drunk or high or both, who thought "What the hell, let's print a really awful story and promote the hell out of it. I'm sure people will buy it, after all Americans don't care about grammar anyway."  I'm not going to dive into the plot of the story- you can read it above. This book falls short of one of the best in literature. How they compare this guy to Faulkner is beyond me, the comparrison is an insult to Faulkner and people who read books in general. Most fifth graders can write better, more enthralling naratives.  
 [...] Although globalization, the latest theme to embrace the academic and journalistic worlds, is the subject of these two very readable books, it is handled very differently in both. Zachary, a senior writer for the Wall Street Journal, propounds the thesis that a new cosmopolitan figure is emerging on the world stage. This figure is equally at home in Japan or Ireland and is unencumbered by the prejudices of the past. This a new kind of Superman, who treats the world as his oyster and is as happy eating oysters as he is drinking pints of Guinness or bottles of sake. He is the true cosmopolitan and tomorrow, if Zachary is to be believed, belongs to him.  To make the same argument on a global scale, he introduces us to a host of globalized characters. We meet Barry Cox, an English kid from Liverpool who sings pop songs in perfect Cantonese; Vince Morabito, a nomadic farm expert who is equally at home in the wheat fields of Nebraska, the vineyards of Moldova or the rice paddies of Southeast Asia; Soo Ing, the German-educated, Canadian-born daughter of Chinese immigrants, who ranges the Mongolian plains on horseback studying the uses and abuses of fire. These super human characters all seem to be modeled on Indiana Jones, Laurence of Arabia or other such folk heroes. They certainly seem to travel a lot.  Micklethwait and Wooldridge, who both write for the Economist magazine, pursue a broadly similar path and also introduce us to an array of cosmocrats who are spearheading this revolution from one end of the world to the other. The authors introduce us to a range of people who are exporting Southern California's pornography to the four corners of the earth. We meet traditional Moroccan perfume sellers who export their fragrances to the entire world. We also meet Zambian-born economists, German and Japanese auto workers, Singaporean math teachers, Indian entrepreneurs and a galaxy of other characters drawn from just about every nation in the world showing us the benefits of this globalized age. Although the authors also show us some of the downsides, the overall message is clear. Globalization is the way of the future.  Despite articulate prophets like these, that future will be a long time in coming even in export-oriented countries like Japan and Ireland, which remain prisoners to the fortunes of the international economy. Countries and nations will continue to nurture their different cultures and opposition to the pronouncements of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other messiahs of globalization will remain as perennial as the economic insecurity globalization has visited upon most of the world's communities.   People, in other words, will still strive for meaning and a sense of belonging in today's global village. This need to belong will ensure that conflict will remain as perennial as attempts like these two books to reduce all of our desires and experiences to a simple cocktail of clichés. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, belief in Marxism waned. Many of Marxism's apostates have now embraced this new credo. Unfortunately, it explains as little as did the writings of the cosmopolitan Karl Marx, who is used as a straw man in the last chapter of the book by Micklethwait and Wooldridge. Ultimately, theories like globalization, which purport to explain everything, explain absolutely nothing. The same goes for these two books. Although they give us a nice overview of what the authors do with their time, they leave us none the wiser at the end.  Worse still, by marginalizing the very real social and economic problems globalization begets, they help to guarantee that they will continue to fester in the years to come. Individuals like Osama bin Laden, who think globally and act locally, will see to that. There is, in other words, nothing new, noteworthy or novel beneath the covers of these and similar eminently readable but ultimately disappointing books 
 I bought the book hoping for reasonable reproductions of the original "Fractured Fairy Tales" from Bullwinkle.  For example, Pinocchio wakes up and wants a cup of "Joe"?  Come on, how nineties can you  get?  That is just one example of how the original fractured fairy tales  have been bastardized by this book 
 Carlos Castaneda picked up some adherents who saw him as a mystic philosopher with access to the great mysteries of knowledge, but he was more of an early version of today's self-help hucksters who are convinced that their contrived allusions to poorly-defined spiritualism actually make them messianic gurus. The main problem is Castaneda's supposed teacher Don Juan, who is deified as a pure and noble shaman who disdains the spiritual emptiness of modern western society. But Don Juan's character is laughably thin and inconsistent, as the righteous shaman of the small Indian village somehow voices all of Castaneda's westernized opinions.  If Don Juan truly existed, which is highly doubtful, he would have been one of those "gurus" who drew gullible drugged-out hippies into his cult to provide him with free stuff.  But actually, the same could be said about Carlos Castaneda. He either made lots of rubes fall for his half-baked spirituality, or convinced himself of the reality of his own imagination.  As for the Don Juan philosophy, he was apparently descended from the ancient Toltec shamans of Mexico, and has inherited the deep universal knowledge of the old Mesoamerican mystics. This is quite convenient for Castaneda, because the religion of the Toltecs is not very well understood by modern archeologists and anthropologists, so Castaneda took the opportunity to construct it himself. But he still could have given us something more creative than the warmed-over Buddhism and Taoism that he actually delivered, with a few motifs from stereotypical Native American mythology thrown in. Don Juan's teachings don't get any deeper than typical Eastern concepts of "seeing" and "awareness" of the deep mysteries of humanity. Even the core concept of not being obsessed with oneself is borrowed directly from the most basic Buddhist stereotypes.  Meanwhile, Castaneda keeps harping about how emotionally overwhelming all of his sessions with Don Juan were, but he can't write anything stronger than stock new age gibberish like "I marveled how easily my emotional states could escalate to nearly unmanageable heights or drop to nothing." Wow that's real deep, man.  I have nothing against people who wish to take semi-mystical fluff like this seriously, when searching for alternatives to unsatisfying mainstream belief systems. But you should trade up, not down. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 Originally, I purchased this heavy-duty case to protect my new expensive 8525.  However, wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip, my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up.  Luckily the phone was not functionally damaged, but I have several big dents and scratches on the case.  I'm going to stop using a case now, since the phone is now already beat-up.  The latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use, especially since you'll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen.  Also, it took a bit getting used to, to have to open the case to make a phone call.  The overall quality of this case is very good tho, because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons.  I guess its a great case if you don't wear it on your belt.  But I can't justify such a huge case if I carry it in my pocket. 
 Unlike everyone else in the world, I did not find this book to be all that great.A guy goes to baseball games or watches them on TV and gives you his side of things.Save yer money and come to my house I can do the same thing. Not much to hold my interest other than watching Tom Seaver play and a few trivial research interests.It is sad to think that this book may have been the book of it's time 
 I know that this was a memoir, but at one chapter, the title is definately misleading, and many of the goals and events received highly biased coverage.  Ms. Zia begins with a survey of history of how Asians were treated in America.  While I agree that the treatement was not ideal and certainly horrific by today's standards, there is absolutely no historical context here.  Unfortunately, Blacks were treated MUCH worse.  Catholics were vilified far before Asians were, and for much longer.  The way she presents things, you would only think that Asians were getting the short end of the stick.  She also harps on the lack of positive images of Asians in the media.  She self selects a small sampling, while there has been an increasingly large number of positive Asian role models in American culture.  Do the Italians whine when most Italian characters in media culture are mobsters?  She even imagines slights where they don't exist - for example, Sulu in Star Trek.  He was hard working to be sure (not that there is anything wrong with that), but as any fan of the series will tell you, he DID have a swashbuckling side to him.  If there is anyone who was emotionless and hard working, that would have been Spock, played by a white.  Besides, Sulu eventually made captain of the best vessel in the fleet.  So much for a negative image.  She gets into the issue of ethnic casting, focusing on Miss Saigon.  Well, it works both ways.  If only Asians can portray Asians, then Asians shouldn't portray whites either.  Too bad Lucy Liu.  Her character in Charlie's Angels was WHITE in the series, but was made half-Asian in the movies.  Opps, Lucy isn't even half Asian.  I would like to see Helen come over here to Asia to complain about the negative images of foreigners.  How many negative images of foreigners exist in Hong Kong and Japanese movies?  There was an advertising campaign here in Taiwan where a company had three white men in jail costumes after being arrested.  Foreigners are constantly portrayed by media outlets in several Asian countries in a negative light.  Why can't you get on your soapbox about that?  She comments on how many Asians are complemented on their English even if they have been in the U.S. their whole life.  Well, how many people who look white in Asia have been here their whole lives, but are still referred to as foreigners?  It works both ways Ms. Zia.   She also gets into her homosexuality.  What does THAT have to do with Asian American Dreams?  Like most Americans, those of Asian descent are opposed to homosexuality.    Finally, there is the notion of hyphenated Americanism (though she technically doesn't succomb to it because the omits the hyphen.)  She wants Asians to be treated as equals in America.  I have no problem with that.  I would like to see the same thing.  However, when you put your ethnic homeland BEFORE American in what you call yourself, how do you think you will ever be accepted as truly American 
 This was my first Jance novel and probably my last. I am an open minded progressive reader of many novels and believe that we are all entitled to free speech and thought but throughout this book, men are relegated to subordinate if not subservient roles which is clearly not mainstream or believable. Many false assertions regarding the Catholic church abound with a specific reference to pediphile priests being dumped in New Mexico as if it was a known fact. The most offensive reference being that God clearly must be a woman. Do not buy from this author if morally conservative 
 First of all, shame on the women who gave this book glowing reviews on the first few pages!  I was completely shocked (had to re-read the passages several times) by the authors suggestion that a woman who was sexually approached by a co-worker basicallly overreacted by becoming angry, and that she should have instead interpreted the pass as his awkward attempt to "find some way to connect with her.  Might she have deflected the pass but turned the attempt into something more suitable to a collegial work relationship?"(page126)  Give me a break!  I can't believe that this example of gaining influence over people ever made it past the editor.  And if that wasn't bad enough, they again insulted women on page 226, when they explain that a women ponders her failure in a management role by saying "I still haven't figured out why they allowed a female - especially one without an engineering background - to manage the project".  What?!?  I had to check the front of the book to see if it was published in the 60s!  Besides these profoundly ignorant examples, I found the book to be less than marginal in developing my ability to influence those around me.  I'll look elsewhere 
 Disney definitely is getting their money's worth out of this guy. They give him a teaching award, and then their publishing arm, Hyperion, gets him to crank out these books of platitudes, making what I'm sure is a pile of cheddar for both Mickey and Ron. It seems to me though, that there is some question as to whether or not Ron has any claim on still being a teacher or "educator". A quick glance at his web site has him scheduled for speaking engagements into October '05, well past the start of the new school year. Speaking before docile groups of teachers at an inservice is hardly the same as facing a classroom full of rowdy adolescents. There is also a claim on his web site that he is starting a school for diadvantaged kids and that he is "arranging funding", yet their is no fund raising appeal on the site or any details as to where the school might be, grade levels, etc. With many urban school systems allowing charter schools, and with his reputation, I'm sure that he could have had such a school funded and running for this school year. Of course to run a school, he would have to deal with students again, and they wouldn't be handing him cash, like you, if you buy this book 
 I found this book quite unsatisfactory. The main focus is always on the Western Front (shockingly leaving out the Americans and their indispensable human and logistical support). The Eastern and Italian fronts are almost completely left out. The Author seem to ignore that millions of soldiers fought and died far from the Marne and the Somne (being Italian myself, I would like to remind the Author that the Italians had 600,000 dead and millions of wounded in the Great War). The sacrifice of Russian and Italian soldiers kept hundreds of German and Austrian divisions far from the Western front and the British troops. And what about the big blounder of the Peace of Versailles? Is still too embarassing for Mr Keegan to talk about it?  
 Ordered this book and was all excited waiting for it to come; figured it was right up my alley. When it arrived and I looked inside I knew when I saw the map that it was about area like Yuma, Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso. The HOT areas of the Southwest. Well, there's a lot of the Southwest that is high and cold and this book is for the low, hot areas. If you live within site of the Colorado mountains as I do in the Four Corners, this book will be of no use at all. Too bad I was given no hint about that and now have to deal with the hassle of a return and pay for it too!  Should have called it something like "Low Desert Gardening" or something.. 
 Robert Laughlin is a great physicist who has found some truly important insights about condensed matter physics in general and the fractional quantum Hall effect in particular, and he deserves his 1998 physics Nobel prize.  But his attempts to say something profound about fundamental physics and particle physics seem far less serious. Be sure that my opinion is shared not only by a huge majority of "fundamental physicists" but even by many colleagues of Laughlin in condensed matter physics. The main problem with his reasoning is that he has obviously no solutions for the problems he tries to address.   All of us agree that some important features of physical phenomena do not depend on the details of underlying physics; many of these phenomena are emergent in character; it is not too important or useful to know quarks or strings in order to study most of the important concepts in biology, climate, physics of water, or quantum computing. If Laughlin thinks that other physicists do not realize this fact, then he is fighting a strawman. Most physicists realize these things - and many fundamental physicists actually use very similar mathematical techniques as Laughlin does in his "emergent" approach.  But at the same moment, there are contexts - and particle physics and/or fundamental physics is a textbook example - where we simply do need to ask different questions. We need to know what natural laws underlie the phenomena we observe at longer distances. We need to find more fundamental, more elementary, and usually smaller constituents of the matter and the interactions that control their dynamics.   We need to study these questions whenever we want to determine physics more accurately; we also need to study these questions because we want to acquire a deeper knowledge that is necessary for future constructions of emergent theories; we need to investigate the underlying physics in order to illuminate some features and parameters of the effective theories that the effective theories themselves simply don't explain and can't explain. People have been looking for more fundamental theories of the real world for quite some time, they have made a tremendous progress in this reductionist quest, and the reductionist approach is responsible for many of the achievements of the modern era. If there were no reductionists in the 19th and 20th centuries, electrons would not have been discovered and Laughlin could probably never construct the wavefunction for which he was awarded by the Swedish Academy of Sciences.  Laughlin seems to misunderstand these points. He thinks that his dislike for particle physics is a valuable idea by itself. It's not. He has nothing to say about these issues, and therefore silence would be better for him and for everyone else. The same conclusion holds for Laughlin's opinions about the black holes and other issues in the realm of fundamental physics.   Laughlin seems to believe that the condensed matter physics way of thinking is very rare among particle physicists, string theorists, and general relativists, and therefore it is very important for him to present conjectures that the black holes are made of plastic or something very similar. But such conjectures are not too useful because fundamental physics simply does not work in this way. If physics of polymers were important for the research of black holes, it is very likely that the black hole physicists would be forced to figure out how to apply these rules even without the help of Prof. Laughlin.  The book uses many metaphors from the everyday life. The author usually offers ten sentences even though his simple and shallow idea is completely clear already from the sentence number one. Several chapters at the end of the book are redundant as wholes.  You don't need to read this book. The main ideas can be summarized as follows: Prof. Laughlin believes that we should always be satisfied with a superficial description of physical phenomena and we should never try to look "inside" in order to identify more elementary components. Prof. Laughlin is wrong, he has nothing to say about the important questions that Laughlin believes are unimportant, he actually says nothing about most of the important questions in the reductionist vs. emergent debate, and you better save your money and time 
 Yea I agree, these are the artists that give hiphop a bad name, if you could even call these guys artists. This album is strictly made for clubs, and for BET and MTV watchers and mainstream listeners. This is radio music, and stuff you would hear in the clubs. Thats all this music is good for. It has no creativity. The production on this album isnt bad, but lyrics, come on, you cant call these lyrics. I suggest you pass this album up unless your a mainstream listener. No top 5 for this album 
 The movie wasn't bad, just not what I was looking for.  It was more of a comedy than anything. Language was a little rougher than I expected as well.  I was looking for a good, laid back mountain man/indian movie with a good script and scenery.  
 (...) The name of the song the fat Hawaiian is playing is "Never Forget Where I'm From." It's good. I don't know if you can actually get a copy of him singing it though; he was good too. This song also appears on "The Very Best Of: Justin" and "Hawaiian style 2" -both are searchable right here on AMAZON.co 
 Unable to see the movie. Received the original shipment, and later a replacement, and both had the same defects and we were unable to watch the movie 
 My son loved making lots of noise on this guitar but the amp no longer works after only a few months and now he can't use it all.  I would not recommend this product

I am a rider (of horses) and found Grant had a good overall knowledge of horses except the with the red pony it is slightly unrealistic in that boys are leading wars too. But if you relax and ignore some of the solutions it is ok at bes 
 I feel that it is my duty to inform you that many of the "recipes" in The Anarchist Cookbook are misleading, incorrect, and potentially lethal.  For example, the procedure in the book for making nitroglycerin is incorrect.  If the book's steps are followed, one will end up with nitrotriodite, which is extremely volatile and can explode at the touch of a finger.  William Powell was nothing more than an angry, misinformed hippie.  If you're looking for a more viable source of information about explosive, take some chemistry courses.  The only thing you're going to blow up with this book is yourself 
 If you are looking for a great story that will really drag you into it, don't read this book.  Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters.  There is not an ounce of structure to this.  It's just a bunch of thoughts and "reports" of sightings of UFO's, "mothmen" and other oddities.  I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel.  I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance.  All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!? 
 This book claims that Plato wasn't an anti-democrat. Or was he? Actually, the author tries to have it both ways. On the one hand, Sara Monoson admits that Plato had strong anti-democratic and elitist tendencies (you might say that again). On the other hand, she nevertheless wants to "unsettle the orthodoxy" and claim Plato for democracy. It's not working. The method of this book is fundamentally flawed. Monoson points out that Plato shared many of the cultural conceptions of Athens. But that is hardly surprising. Plato was an Athenian, not a Spartan or Cretan. It doesn't prove that he was democratic. Monoson also claims, that Plato's rethoric often derived from various democratic practices. But, once again, this proves very little. Even fascist rethoric is partially derived from democratic ideology, for instance the populist appeals to the people or the nation. This doesn't prove that Hitler was a democrat. (Incidentally, I'm not claiming that Plato was like Hitler. I'm simply trying to make a methodological point.) What makes Plato Plato, what makes Plato tick, is precisely his controversial ideas, including his sometimes disturbing criticism of democracy. We cannot domesticate Plato. We have to wrestle with him as he really was. Friend or foe alike, we're doing Plato a disservice by turning him into a harmless icon.  
  I took a chance and it didnt work for me.  I have a LG VX-8600. Had to return the product...good luck to you 
 This book is hard to find things in and doesn't seem extremely well-organized. Besides that, it's annoying because it looks like it was done on an old school typewriter. I thought I'd need it because I need to write a lot of papers for my classes, but it turns out I can just look in the journals I'm using for the citation style for the most part. 
 In 1990 Bill Bryson set out to "do Europe". He says that his motivation was to relive his experiences from tours in Europe in 1972 and 1973 when he was a young student wandering around Europe with a backpack.  In reality it seems as if the primary reason for Bill Bryson to do this trip was so that he could then write a funny book about the trip.  "Neither Here Nor There" is, in fact, a very funny book, at least in the beginning. Bill Bryson can describe situations in a very humorous way, and he's willing to make fun of himself, as well as everything around him.  Unfortunately, after a while the humor wears thin. Then it wears very thin. Then you begin to dissect the humor, and realize that you've been had.  Bill Bryson's method of traveling is to emulate the kind of tourism we all like to ridicule. He typically arrives by train in a new city in the evening. He has no hotel reservation so he has to spend time finding a hotel that is not really what he wanted. He sees "the sights" that one is supposed to see in that city. He makes no effort to get in touch with the local people, to learn about their lives, or to understand their country and society. He spends typically 2-3 days in each city and then goes to work on figuring out how to get to the next city or country on his list, which often leads to further complications.  This is obviously not the way to travel if you're writing a travel book. Nobody in their right mind would want to read about this kind of traveling.   But Bill Bryson is not writing a travel book, he's writing a funny book, and he has a sure-fire recipe:  1. Do things in problematic ways, and then make fun of all the trials and tribulations that result.  2. Mix in lots of flashbacks to the trips of your youth, with much juvenile humor related to the drives that young men are so driven by.  3. Feign incomprehension about everything foreign and satirize everything that is unfamiliar.  4. Make funny remarks intended to reinforce national prejudices.  This last type of humor can be especially tiring. Here are a few examples to illustrate what I mean:  "Let's face it, the French Army couldn't beat a girls' hockey team." (pg 32)  "The (German) women still don't shave their armpits. ... They all look so beautiful and stylish, and then they lift up their arms and there's a Brillo pad hanging there." (pg 91)  "In Norway, three people and a bottle of beer is a party; in Sweden the national sport is suicide." (pg 97)  "But the most preposterous law of all, a law so pointless as to scamper along the outer reaches of the surreal, is the Swedish one that requires motorists to drive with their headlights on during the daytime." (pg 110)  "I love the way the Italians park. You turn any street corner in Rome and it looks as if you've just missed a parking competition for blind people." (pg 123)  In conclusion, if you're someone who "did Europe" in your youth and you want to relive fond memories in a humorous way, then you may well like this book. Most other readers will probably start out laughing, then smiling, then wondering why the jokes seem to have lost their appeal, and finally ending up wishing they'd picked a real travel book or a real humorous book.

 Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares") 
 Despite the cute illustrations this book is about crude, rude boars (or boors).  While an adult may (or may not) think this is sarcasm, for sure kids won't "get it!"  This is a lousy example to set before kids of any age.  The kids will love the poop pictures and farts and general bad behavior, but most parents (and especially grandparents) will be VERY put off by this book.  I wish I had my money back.  I did NOT give the book to the child it was bought for.  I threw it away instead 
 The first 40 pages of this book was somewhat interesting. However, everything else was repetitious. Almost the entire book was about every film he starred in or directed......nothing new!  
 As a holder of a doctoral degree myself, from the University of Washington, and having had additional training on fellowship at Stanford University, [...]  In his writing, Wood never takes a breath, or any other pause for serious reflection.  He manifests no rational evaluation of competing thoughts on any page of the text; he merely spews a haphazard series of diatribes.  Wood provides no new insights, but merely repeats Fawn Brodie's outdated and questionable citations to the 19th-century equivalents of National Enquirer sources.    Wood's fiery accusations provide dim light, at best 
 This book confirms something which should have been obvious to most people years and years ago: Sontag's work has always been all about style.  This is a woman who has modeled her life and work on the image of the Central European intellectual.  Her productions are one long affectation of Mitteleuropa world-weariness.  Take a look at her "Elegy for Europe".  She praises the "ethical seriousness" of European intellectual life, but the only thing of substance she's ever taken away from 20th-century European intellectuals is their political nihilism.  In that context, there is nothing surprising about her inhumane ramblings on the "courage" of Mohammed Atta & Co., just a couple of days after the worst terrorist attack in history, or her denunciation of the "disconnect" between the American reaction to the events and their true significance.  The *real* disconnect, and the source of all of the pretentious buffoonery we've had to put up with for so long, is Sontag's own alienation from her country.  It is in times like these that we find ourselves wishing that Susan Sontag had never returned from her Parisian garret 
 I thought the information in this book was not usefull to me in any way. I was really disapointed 
 I found this book to be lacking.  In character development, plot, etc.  It just never really went anywhere - not that it needed to but it just didn't grab me as her other novels have.  I found it to be very underdeveloped.  Perhaps, as one other reviewer wrote, this was before she hit her stride?  That's what I think 
 this movie is such a rip-off of every sci-fi/horror movies that have come before it that i just couldn't enjoy it! a waste of my time and money and i'll not waste any more time on this stinker or it's review!! 
 This review is for the 156 minute version.  I rented this thinking it was the one with the bees in the Superdome, but no that was THE SAVAGE BEES.  Instead I got 2 1/2 hours of Michael Caine looking like he wanted to kill himself for taking this movie.  It really is that bad.  My eyes were sore from rolling them so much.  How exactly do you assemble such an impressive cast and still make an epically bad film?  Answer: you give them a script that is so horrible it would make Ed Wood's head spin.  Don't believe me? This movie features not one but two separate scenes were it instantly switches from day to night.  How about hanging plants on the outside of a skyscraper?  Or a guy in a wheelchair kicking open a door?  The pain begins with the Army finding civilian Michael Caine inside a locked underground military facility.  He's alive and everybody else is dead of invisible bee stings.  Why he's alive and how he got there is never explained.  The President decides that since Caine just happens to be a bee expert to put him in charge of the Army's campaign to destroy the killer bees.  Around 40,000 deaths later (I'm not joking) the Army takes control and they attack the billions of bees - that have now taken over Houston - with flamethrowers!  Somebody got paid to write this?!  Fred MacMurray and Richard Chamberlain were the only ones that walked away from this wreck unscathed.  Everybody else, even the great Henry Fonda should be embarrassed.   
 Disc Picture: As intended by the filmmakers, the stylized VC-1-encoded 1.85:1 HD DVD picture features differing color schemes depending on the location. The entire presentation is void of highly resolved fine details.  Soundtrack: The Dolby® Digital Plus 5.1-channel soundtrack is not overly exciting, although bass is delivered well through each of the channels, although the noise floor is low, dialogue and effects are generally well recorded, and the sound matches the storytelling nicely. 
  think Janov's book The Primal Scream is too full of unscientific jumps of logic. His assertion that it is only logical to pursue pain to reverse the effects of pain is simplistic. Even if it is true that in the forward direction, trauma causes psychological problems (true I think, and important), it does not neccessarily mean the reverse is obviously true - that to reexperience pain will lead to a joyful existence that resembles the joy of young children. In my experience, the results from primal therapy also shine doubt on Janov's assertions. It is a pity, because so much of the book is valuable and important, for example the emphasis of love, and the criticisms of robotically extinguishing behaviors with behaviorism (not all behaviorism is bad though) are all good. But Janov's theory is taken to the extremes in his books, and by his followers, spoiling the valid points that they make. For example, gentle births and avoiding birth traumas are noble and correct causes. However, claiming that ALL psychological problems may have birth trauma as the underlying cause is pushing it too far. Suggesting reliving birth over and over again will reverse the effects of birth is also getting wacky. (this is found more in Janovs books after 1971). Janovs works have a tendency to draw you in with true and emotional themes, but they take you too far into his single deterministic model, and get you beleiving in things that are not proven, and actually unlikely. His model of understanding fails in some circumstances (as do all the grand theories), and in some cases evidence exists that contradicts some of the theory (for example modern research on surgery suggested mammals do better WITH pain medication, in the Primal Scream Janov suggested avoiding pain meds wherever possible, something I thing he may now disagree with, but has made no formal retraction).  I would recommend learning about all the models in psychology to put this work in context, and look at all the recent data in the field 1990 to 2006. Despite Janov's attack on Freud, Primal is a derivative of Freudian work, with some of the similar problems and benefits that come from that model. The worst thing you could do is wrap yourself in a primal blanket, and think psychology's rejection of this work is somehow repressed or a conspiracy. Mainstream psychology would correctly argue that the evidence is mostly case study from a specific skewed population of Janov followers, at a specific time in their optimism and therapy cycle. Similar miraculous reports are found in spiritual healing practices, again with believer's testimony being emphasised and published when it is positive.  In addition, rememeber this work was written a long time ago, and the diatribe against other psychological treatments is out of date (and in part unfair even at the time). However some of the criticisms of other treatments were valid, and important.  Use scientific and critical thinking to make your own decisions about this work. It's not all wrong, if you have your wits about you and you filter the information, it could help fill your life with love and improve the life of your children. Janov is right, love is the most important thing is raising children, and he does a good job of defining love between an parent and child.  On the other hand, if you take all of it to heart, and to the extreme, and then go on to destroy all relations with your family, create false memories, and spend decades trying to cry, scream and holding your breath in birth primals, it might just spoil your life.  It could go either way, so think independently for yourself.  Consider too, I may be wrong, so look at all the data with a critical eye, and draw on all areas of psychological research for clues.  
 I was disappointed by "Beautiful Evidence". It seems to me to be a medium primarily for the reproduction of many gorgeous drawings, graphs, and tables done by others and the author, and an opportunity to make a rant on PowerPoint. Yes, many bad figures have been created and Dr. Tufte has made valid points and good suggestions, but they are not as densely presented as one would expect from his own words.  One of Dr. Tufte's main theses is a good figure has high information density, yet his text descriptions do not measure up to this standard. They are regularly repetitive or shallow. He even misses an opportunity to take his own advice when he presents the cancer rate data on p. 174 and then re-presents it as a new table on p. 176 in a better format. If he had used the concept he presented through the Bumps chart on p. 56, allowing lines for the cancer types to cross according to the values of the rates so each column is correctly ordered, relationships would have been even clearer.  Although tables can be dense with information, it is the very density that makes them difficult to interpret and understand. A beautiful, but very complex, figure created from all of complex table is not necessarily better at communication even if it is interesting or pleasing to look at. This is why so often figures are made from subsets of tables. The challenge to the presenter is to find what is important in the data and clearly present it.  I often felt attempts were made to find something auspicious to say about a well executed figure when nothing more than the "beauty is apparent" is needed.  Although I don't malign PowerPoint as Dr. Tufte does, I am not enamored of it either. However, faulting the program as he does seems to me akin to faulting a hammer for the bent over nails driven into wood. A better hammer might drive nails more easily, but it is the person wielding the hammer who has the primary controlling effect. Handing out a copy of "The Table of Casualties" to an audience would certainly put more information into their hands, but it will get little into their minds. It is up to the presenter to find a means of communicating the meaningful information to those who couldn't be bothered to study such data. Whether PowerPoint slides or Word reports are used, the presenter must consider the audience and how to get important details into their heads.   Spend time enjoying the figures and know good data presentation is hard 
 First let me say that I am a huge fan of Martha Grimes--both the Richard Jury mysteries and her other novels.  I love the characters she has constructed in the Jury series.  But this was just plain awful.  The writing style could almost be described as meandering and disjointed--not good in a mystery with a complicated plot.  There are passages that I have read over and over again, and about the meaning of which I still remain confused.  I agree with other reviewers that while certain elements of the story --investments, horse racing, premarin production, etc.--were intriguing, they involved too many events that defied credibility.  I also found it disturbing and incredible that every male in this novel seemed to be obsessed, sexually, with a seventeen year old female.  All but one of these male characters was old enough to be her father or grandfather.  It almost seems as if this was a first draft that needed re-working and polishing.  Disappointing 
 I am glad to see I am not the only one who thought this book was bad. I listened to it on audio cassette and kept waiting for a plot to come along. I can't even imagine the author finding it at all interesting.  I was expecting at least something of entertainment value having read a couple of her other books that were good 
 The concept of the title sounded great since, like most golfers, I tend to think too much. But actually the book gives you very little more than it's title. Basically, it's message is "forget about it' AND GO SEE A PGA PRO. There is really no substance here 
 Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments.  Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date.  The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world.  This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of.  The story never generates tension, and there is no climax.  McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough.  There must be some story.  To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written.  I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one 
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 When I read Potatoes Not Prozac, I thought, "at last, a book on diet that doesn't focus on losing weight!" After all, food acts in the body in a much more complex way than simply making you lose or gain weight. Apparently DesMaisons decided to pick up on the weight-loss market and rewrite PnP for losing weight. I felt her style of explaining how I feel now and how I'm going to feel after doing her plan, little more than the common weight-loss testamonials you see in every second-rate diet advertisement. By the way, I have eliminated sugar from my diet and it has not "changed my life" or solved all my problems. The 4 billion dollar diet industry, which DesMaisons has become a part of with this book, banks on those types of claims.  
 Very very small......cute,but it should have been bigger so a child could actually play with it and get the feeling of a tackle box -- WAY TO SMALL! 
 I fell in love with the Boccherini piece when I heard it in the movie, and bought the soundtrack mainly for it, but what you get on the CD is a very short arrangement and not very satisfying.  It was also a disappointment to find that the soundtrack doesn't include the end titles music from the movie, which I enjoyed.  It's still a good CD for listening, just not what I hoped for 
 Tom Berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film.  It has the feel and tone of  the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a Sunday afternoon when you're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen.  The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film (when most of the musical scenes occur) are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.  Worse yet, the sets do not look like 1963.  This is very clearly a cheap production, doomed from the start by an awful script, terrible acting, and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era.  Here's the premise of the film: years after Eddie, the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the Cruisers, has disappeared (he died in a car accident, but his body was never recovered), a reporter decides to write a story about the band.  She has a theory that Eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance, if the missing final recordings, named A Season in Hell, can be located.  She forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members, who are, by the way, dull as dirt, to piece together the band's history.  The reporter is so creepy and annoying that she'd probably have a restraining order slapped on her, nowadays.  Ironically enough, A Season in Hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience 
 The prose is outdated and verbose, seemingly put together by a jobless college professor.  The information is not at all what I was looking for. The author discusses at length the religious/spiritual aspects of masonry. I do not recommend and won't even resell my copy - straight to the trash can! 
 It is unfortunate this book didn't come out better. Some glaring problems with it include: - has no concept of energy physics to begin with - does not understand "hydrogen economy" (hydrogen's an expensive storage, not a source of energy) - downplays geological data of oil discovery (or doesn't understand it), although Hubbert is covered briefly - believes or disseminates half-baked unproven ideas from the research sector: scientifically not valid energy sources are brought forward as alternative fuels - does not deal with the net energy concept (EROEI) or even refer to it  With these fundamental oversights it's really difficult to recommend the book.  It's not completely without merit as it does tell some of the basics right, but mostly it's pathologically impartial journalistic fluff, without looking at the hard facts as a good researcher should.   It's too much about how we are miraculously going to replace oil, gas and coal with tar sands, nuclear power, hydrogen and live happily ever after.  To those readers who want to believe this, this might be a good book. People looking for valid and scientifically solid reasoning on the subject will be sorely disappointed.  I'd recommend books by Deffeyes, Simmons, Heinberg, Campbell and many others before this (all on peak oil) 
 Just do a search on the internet for underground railroad quilts and you will find many web sites that debunk the myths set forth in this book. Although the concept is appealing, there is absolutely no evidence other than one woman's story to back it up. Almost all underground railroad historians and quilt historians label this book as FICTION, not fact! There is so much factual material to learn about the Underground Railroad - it is an insult to the history of black Americans to perpetuate a myth 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 I'm a design professional and rely on books as resources for insight to the work being produced out there. But when I got this book and opened it, I could hardly find a page or spread that had anything decent on it. This book reminds me of some of the resource books I used in college 8+ years ago. This book's content is very poor quality and very dated material. It's the only book I've ever purchased online and been highly dissappointed about its content. I'd trade this book for a yo-yo at this point. Trust me, DO NOT purchase this book 
 This was my first Balzac, and I was very disappointed. The story line was both thin and unconvincing, and I felt Balzac struggled in vain to make it interesting. Much of the novel was a brave attempt by the author to pad out the story to make up for the inadequacies of the plot. The introduction stated that Balzac was influenced by Sir Walter Scott - this explains a lot, as this novel belongs to the same sorry collection as Scott's worst 
 First of all, consider the question that Lewis is trying to ask. What went wrong with the 'Middle East' and their 'failure' to modernize? And now think about how big this book is, about 150 pages. The 'Middle East' is a huge area extending from Morocco to Iran and he attempts to explain their 'failure' to modernize by reviewing the last years of the Ottoman Empire. That is just plain lazy work on the part of a historian who is supposed to be revered in his field.   Another issue is that he constantly refers to the 'Middle East' as 'Islam' as though Islam is homogenous or even centered in the Ottoman Empire. Granted the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire was also the Caliph but the Twelver Shi'is don't consider him to be legitimate anyway. To consider Islam to have some kind of collective thought process when encountering the 'West' is reprehensible. Consider now the fact that the majority of Muslims don't even live in the Middle East or the Ottoman Empire. How can Lewis truthfully use the term 'Islam' in his book to refer to the entity that 'went wrong' when the area he's speaking about doesn't even constitute the majority of Muslims in the world!?   This book is a quick read for people who aren't in the field to think that they're informed about what is going on in the scary area known as the 'Middle East'. The worst part is that the only people who would know that this is full of holes and lacking greatly in background and professionalism are the people who wouldn't normally read it anyway. This is a dangerous book because the name Bernard Lewis is synonymous with Expert in Middle East affairs. This was a lazy, half hearted attempt to cash in on people's ignorance and only perpetuates the wrong ideas in people's minds. Bad Lewis, very very bad. Any 'liberal historian' who suggests this book should be beaten with this book, unfortunately for us the book is very thin so it will take a while to bring him down with it.  If you want better sources, look to John Esposito, Albert Hourani and Nikki Keddie. All of them have published widely and lack the obvious political biases of Bernard Lewis. Check them out. 
 The tables and diagrams are confusing and too busy. The pyramid concept (having an objective in mind and actually assembling a document to support the objective) could have been written by a college sophomore. The advice given is so basic; I wondered why anyone would even bother to reduce it to writing 
 Judge Pressler's views in "A Hill On Which to Die..." though may be sincere, lacks the breadth of theological understanding of the various expressions of Christianity. Pressler, like many Fundamentalists, fail to accept that much of our understanding of scripture and theological concepts are interpretations and very few of the arguments that he is willing to die for would effect salvific truth. Every sincere believer and every denomination thinks in one way or another they have the "correct" view and interpretation. The problem is not believing. Pressler is correct in his argument that one must stand firm in one's belief. However, his failure in the book is the adequate display of the fact that Christianity, even among  faithful Southern Baptists, is broader than the narrow views which he holds. His concepts of Christianity would undoubtedly reject the Christianity of C. S. Lewis (Anglican), J. I. Packer (Anglican), Eugene Peterson (Presbyterian), Mother Theresa (Roman Catholic), and the vast majority of both main line and evangelical Christianity. For these reasons and others, I would not recommend this book 
 This text provides a simple, elementary introduction to the subject of TP therapy, but falls far short of providing a truly useful guide for massage therapists wanting to become skilled in effectively applying these techniques on their clients. This is a large book with very little important information about the nature of TPs pathologies, comprised mostly of body mappings of probable TP locations within muscle groups that are grossly generalized and of little real use in TP palpation. The Davies wookbook is not an expensive guide for understanding the basic concepts, but the serious bodyworker will find little meat to the material before soon needing a much more in-depth guide to go further 
 This monitor is awful. I have had it for 5 months and it has only worked properly for 1. It makes loud beeping noises at the oddest times, like 2 am!!! Do not buy this monitor. The onlt thing it has going is it is nice looking!!! 
 I used to have a Graco Metrolite stroller, and I really liked it. However, I gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system. I bought a used Jeep Liberty Stroller, thinking it would be an upgrade, and boy was I wrong.   I will simply list the things I do not like: 1) It is quite bulky when folded, especially compared to other strollers I've had. 2) It is heavy, awkward to carry, and there's nowhere apparent to grab it. Handles? I don't see any. 3) All 3 tires went flat. My local bike shop charged about $30 to replace them all (your mileage may vary). 4) My daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded, the sounds didn't work so I can't comment on those. 5) It CREAKS when you push it. I'm not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks. 6) The MP3 player, which is the "cool factor" and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller, has these small speakers near the baby's head, so in order to really hear the music if you're playing music YOU like, you have to turn it up. And the volume doesn't go very high. For the same money, you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller. 
 PROS- Quick reference guide with two sample exam and solved solutions  CONS- 1. This is the THIRD printing of this book and it is still chalk full of errors. If you go to the website www.ppi2pass.com to look at the errata they only have it for the first printing so all those errors were alraedy picked up. THE LAST TIME THEY UPDATED THAT WAS IN 2003!!  2. The solutions to the problems are meger at best. Problems are solved out but nothing in depthly. This book is good for a quick reference guide but DO NOT USE IT AS YOUR MAIN STUDY BOOK!  3. THERE IS STILL ERRORS IN A THIRD EDITION 
 and that's what we got....the bird again.  Slowly paced, this story is mildly entertaining. I expected a bigger bang than what was given at the end...instead we see a blurred mythical big bird through water... It will keep your interest...but you will feel cheated by the end for wasting your time.   Rent, don't buy 
 The biggest problem I have with this book is the problem I have with just about every Pat Conroy book...especially the Great Santini: the experience of one particular generation of military brats is taken to be the experience of ALL military brats. Even worse, when many civilians read books like this, it only reinforces the negative perceptions and stereotypes they already have. Books like this, unfortunately, become gospel to all the nay-sayers out there.  I have done a great deal of academic research on American military families since the end of World War II. My entire master's degree program was devoted to this subject. I'm a military brat myself. Thirteen of the first 16 years of my life were spent overseas. So, I like to believe that I'm an expert on the issue. To put things into further perspective, though, both Wertsch and Conroy are closer to my PARENTS' age (Baby Boomers) than MY age. This is my point of departure.  I was born in the mid-'70s. Hence, I'm every bit a child of the '80s. While there were many things I can identify with--the lack of a "home", the constant need to change, adapting, etc.--there were many things that I didn't necessarily relate to. Without going into detail, I know that a lot of this stems from the fact that I grew up in a different point in history than Wertsch and Conroy (the "late" Cold War period rather than the "early" period). I grew up during the age of the All-Volunteer force, when the U.S. military was at its greatest size, when there was the greatest system of support for military families, particularly overseas. On more than one occasion while I was reading this book, I found myself thinking, "That wasn't MY experience." And I know it wasn't the experience of most of the brats I grew up with. By the same token, current post-Cold War, post-9-11 brats probably have experienced things very different from what I experienced.  I don't want to say that there is no value in this book; on the contrary there is a GREAT DEAL of value. However, I believe this is only PART of the story. The sad part is that too many people are taking books like this to be the be-all, end-all in terms of the military brat experience. For me, personally, growing up a brat is the best thing that ever happened to me. It's made me who I am, and if I could do it all over again, Iw wouldn't do anything differently.   
 I was interested in learning more about Savonarola because "The Palace" by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro is set in Renaissance Florence at the time of Savonarola, who plays a part in the novel. Now I love history and read a lot of history books, unfortunately, this book was a big dissapointment. Contrary to the blurb on the back cover this book is hardly riveting nor is it much of a thriller. It only covers the last few years of Savonarola's life but it is more about the political history of Florence than on Savonarola himself. Actually the book does not really seem to have a direction or a point and I could not figure out why the author wrote this.   I would suggest that if you are interested in this book that you find a copy in a book store and read it before you buy otherwise you risk being dissapointed 
 Here are some of the "features" of Herbert Gans's DEMOCRACY AND THE NEWS:  -- Dozens if not hundreds of sentences with such subject phrases as many people, some organizations, most editors, a significant number of elected officials, much of the audience, and some observers.  -- Dozens if not hundreds of sentences containing such qualifiers as perhaps, sometimes, many times, often, may be, could be, might be, probably, may yet be, could in theory be, is difficult to say, and virtually any other squishy generalizer the author could conjure.  -- Repeated assertions that questions deserve to be asked, no one has charted the processes, has not received sufficient consideration, deserves more legwork than it receives, needs discussion, and no one has ever tried to measure.  -- A plethora of vague generalities, occasionally interrupted by such revealing specifics as the fact that "60 Minutes" focuses on watchdog news, that the Florida voting count investigations did not reverse the 2000 Presidential election, that government officials use press leaks as trial balloons, that young people "apparently" obtain their news from "Comedy Central," and that Rush Limbaugh is currently the most famous of radio hosts who draw audiences by being as argumentative as possible.   -- A set of recommendations that would have big city newspapers reporting on which DMV office had the shortest lines, how rising oil prices are affecting Mr. Johnson's body shop, society news written by journalists from "low income backgrounds," reports written in non-standard English, and stories written by teen reporters aabout how new legislation will affect their peers (Beavis and Butthead do Washington). As if American mass culture doesn't already bottom feed enough, Gans would have the mass media dumbing down even further in the name of "localization."  -- An astounding 380 footnotes for 125 pages of text, occupying nearly 20% of the page count and frequently adding further generalizations and loose conjecture on top of the already vague sentences from which they were generated.  -- Possibly the Hope Diamond of meaningless academic writing (referring to a Pew Center study that half the respondents only follow the news wnen something important or interesting is happening): "Whether yet more members of the news audience will adopt this pattern remains to be seen, for it depends on what happens in and to the country." And the stock market will fluctuate and the seasons will change. So sayeth Chauncey Gardener.   Professor Gans manages to insult his readers' intelligence with the astoundingly obvious. At the same time, he barely mentions independent Internet websites and weblogs (Slate, Matt Drudge, Wonkette, etc.), word-of-mouth via multiply-forwarded email, Fox News and MSNBC, talking head programs like Crossfire, current events books focusing on politics, Bill Maher and Jon Stewart, MTV, and almost any other new technology or non-traditional news source. He also completely ignores European news institutions such as BBC News, despite the fact that Europeans frequently know and understand American economic and foreign policy better than most Americans.   If you are looking for a book that deals in critical and specific detail with the roles and issues of the news media in the American democratic system, please look elsewhere. DEMOCRACY AND THE NEWS provides strong evidence that even full professors at Columbia University are not immune from writing 125 pages of heavily footnoted drivel. If this is what "publish or perish" is all about, then please, by all means, perish.  
 This booklet is not worth the money. There was nothing helpful beyond common sense. Save your dollars for a box of bisquits 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I heard this book was great.  No.  I learned nothing new.  I'll have to go to library and see what is really helpful.  
 Keep your kids away from this sewage.  This book should banned from schools. 
 I was quite disappointed in this book.  Cahill has written outstanding material but this collection seems to be a gathering of miscellaneous leftovers.  I was led to this book after reading A Walk in the Woods by Bryson - and it was a false lead. The quality is not there 
 this was the same literature but not the book that was pictured on amazon website.  very old version and took forever to get here 
 Yeah, that's how I felt when I noticed the lack of gore and the lack of development in the characters.  Even the zombies are the same thoughout the picture.  How can a zombie go from one part of town to the next in what would take a serious muscle car at least an hour?    Regardless, it's worth owning to have the scene where they rise out of the cemetery.  The kid is downright annoying but, when I was a kid I liked him!  Suppose it's not time to have kids yet, aye?  Regardless it could have been better.  Flawed  but, if you viewed this before the first one... don't let it stop you from getting the first!  The first one rocked.  I thought the 3rd one was produced much better than this as well... but they just keep killing this series as part 4 and 5 I once again heard were terrible 
 It sure sucks everything up including carpet itself.  I'm concerned that my carpet will be paper thin in few years.  Long cord is good, but both body and wind tunnel part are so heavy to carry around the house and it is not made for wood floor at all.  I don't think it's worth the money and I don't recommend anyone to buy it 
 I remember seeing this film as a kid and thinking to myself, maybe when I'm older I'll understand the signifigance of this movie. But 29 years later I'm even more confused as to why this film was made.   "King of Marvin Gardens" took me a record-breaking four sittings to watch because I kept falling asleep. Don't get me wrong. I appreciate a thoughtful, well-written, well-acted human interest story--but where was the human interest in this flick?? Why am I supposed to be interested in these characters?? Interesting characters don't have to be nice and heroic, but they certainly have to be compelling!   I think after the tremendous success of "Five Easy Pieces" (deservedly so), that genre of anti-story must have been all the vogue in cinema during the mid-1970s. With the exception of the last 10 minutes you have an absolutely flatliner of a film here.  Movies of that period, like "Fat City" and "Scarecrow" do a much more effective job of conveying the dire banality of real life.  Although the packaging and  presentation for the "King of Marvin Garden" DVD was flawless 
 This book is probably not helpful to anyone seeking more than VERY basic social skills.  I did not find anything particularly informative.  The writing is long-winded, is generally an midly annoying, boring lecturing style.  At many points, it actually seemed as if the author was not a man, but rather, someone's wife carrying on about the commonplace, stale female gripes and frustrations about how filthy are their men. Where's the male backbone? Not here. The male author seemed to cowtow to the female of the house; it actually looks like he mirrored the concerns of various women consulted and then determined that essential manners require full male compliance.    Also, the title of the book seems misleading due to the very obvious matters discussed.  I thought this book would build an intermediate or advanced level of male manners, but most of the information is irrelevant or too basic to be helpful.   Sorry for the negative report; it was a let-down, but then again I only paid $5 for it. 
 Perhaps I didn't read the description closely enough.  This book is a historical text, not applicable to today's surveying. 
 This book was horrible....as a practicing Pagan for 11 years now I found it's information both inaccurate and contradicting.  I want to stress something to everyone...not every human being with a Ph.D beside their name know's what the hell they are talking about. More than likely many of you are Pagans and know how to go with your gut feeling. After much research and reading I only read books by D.J. Conway or Edain McCo 
 I work as an editor on high-end projects (mostly commercials and music video's with a couple of well regarded concert DVD's and award winning short film work to my credit) and I have to say that the editing on this disc (and the previous 2, to a lesser extent) demonstrates a real lack of sensitivity to the material.  There is an epic quality to U2 in concert. Each song is its own experience... its own mini event; and instead of letting the power of that experience unfold naturally and organically... letting the music/performance tell its own story (and what a story it is!) the editing imposes itself on the music and the performance(s) and the effect is that you are taken out of (or at least not fully drawn into) the marvelous natural flow of power that is U2 live.  All 3 of these DVD's are worth having simply because the band's brilliance in concert mostly transcends the poor editing but these discs COULD have been truly amazing documentations of almost religious experiences had the director/editor gotten out of their own way and really understood and felt into the event(s).  What a shame 
 Let me give you the scoop on Thisbe Nissan.  I am a student of the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa.  Before I came I made it  apoint to read everyone's books.  I have not had Thisbe Nissan as a teacher and I have not even seen her around except just at a reading.  But this is what I think.  Good People of NYC is a novel of adolescence.  The character's are well formed, but they are characters that no one would want to ever know.  They are childish and it shows just how little this writer knows about the real world.  This book is not worth buying.  Don't even borrow it from a library.  Nissan's first collection suggested that there might be something interesting to come from this writer., but with this work she has failed 
 This book is full of typos; what happened to proofreading...is that a lost art/job?  This book is also a good example of what Andy Rooney spoke of; authors making thousands on the backs of others.  Nothing is original by the author in this book; it is merely a compliation of the works of others.  You would think at least, since the author did have to compose anything, she could have at least proofread it 
 "Wild at Heart" is flawed at heart. It is about the heart of man - not the heart of God.   "Have you got what it takes?" is the recurrent humanistic theme.  The author's psychological analysis of the male psyche is interesting, but its message of "validation" puts man firmly on the throne, and there is no room for that if God is to be King in His kingdom.  It espouses no Christian distinctives whatsoever even though it frequently and selectively misquotes scripture 
 After reading this book, it was apparent to me that the author was implying that Nixon was a dark and grumpy man who needed his image repackaged.  McGinnis boasts of Nixon and his PR teams ability to hide the "true" Nixon and to trick the public into voting for his image.  He proclaims that the real Nixon was the one that the country saw debating Kennedy on TV in 1960.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  First off, Nixon won the 1960 election but did not contest the results for the good of the nation.  All historians admit that JFK had help from Daily in Illinois and LBJ in Texas.  Furthermore, in the 1960 debates, Nixon had a high fever and was recently out of the hospitable and JFK's staff broke into the basement of the studio and turned up the heat to make him sweat! If anyone decieved the voters with his image, it was JFK using his dramatic but bubbly rhetoric and not backing it up and JFK the family man and the idealist.  JFK exploited the Missile Gap, had numerous affairs, assassinated Ngo Dihn Diem, wire tapped Martin Luther King, screwed up the Bay of Pigs, and had ties to the Mafia!  Now, I could be wrong, but JFK's campaign sounds like a true selling of the President.  'Selling of the President' has little credible content but infact is a good historical document that portrays Left Wing propaganda of the 1960s 
 I enjoyed The Gospel According to Larry and the thought provoking topics.  It even had suspense and mystery involved in it.  Vote for Larry was forced, and a rehashing of the same ideas in Gospel.  The plot, what there was of it, was so unbelievable and made the activism of young people seem easy--no hard-work needed.  The struggles young adults would really have experienced were not included, and it made add Constitutional Amendments look like a breeze. Also, the likelihood of an 18 year old getting so much of the Presidential vote in the November election.  I wish the author would have made it more believable and more like the Gospel--that might really incite youth activism 
 PRODUCT IN GENERAL WORKS AS DESCRIBED AND BENEFITS ARE VISIBLE WHEN USED AS DIRECTED. Unfortunately, product failed after 8 months of daily use. The email address and toll free number for customer service for CLARISONIC is completely useless and dead. After my brush became defective, I contacted Clarisonic Customer Service for repair/exchange. Sent five emails over a a two month period, left message on answer machine at Clarisonic customer service and absolutely no answer. The warranty of one year is completely useless at this point. A wise consumer and purchaser should be given a reliable customer service when purchasing this product at this price. USE THE PRODUCT WHILE IT WORKS. When it stops, THROW IT AWAY because you WILL NOT get a response from Clarisonic directly 
 This is a big disappointment! Pictures are not all on one page. The animals are split in half because of this. What a dumb idea!! Save your money. This book isn't worth half of what I paid 
 Requirements for buying this album:  Poor decision making skills, nothing is ever your fault, your genetic destiny is to become a broke and miserable unwed parent with 2 failed marriages before age 30 or your parents took the car keys away because you got a bad report card which makes you want to fantasize fake suicide in your bedroom by landing on top of your Playstation where your cell phone breaks your hip...then yeah, get this album.  Also, you "memorial tattoo" trailer park/apartment complex living mouth breathers might like this one after you've digested Godsmack's first CD 900 times since it's release might want to pick this up as well.  Now...if your mother has crispy 80's hair and goes to tanning beds where your stepsister lives in your basement with her boyfriend and their 2 year old son who wears baby sized basketball jerseys, then Hybrid Theory is a MUST for your collection.  Goes right next to Toby Keith's Shock N Ya'll and the latest from P. Diddy in your assembly-required-particle-board CD storage.  
 How is it possible that the Molly Maguires could be made boring!  It's about real life and real people! History is exciting. This book is a cold and lifeless list-the way many of us were taught history in school. I  wanted to learn about the Molly Maguires but this book was a disaster. The  print was very small-get a magnifying glass-I'm serious.Were I taking a  course in school and this was one of the textbooks and I had a decent  professor then thats ok. This reads like some long boring detailed  document.There should be some sort of warning. I'm not blaming any one but  somewhere there should be an explanation about not just if a given reader  liked a book but what kind of book it is 
 The labels are sticky on one side, and printable on the other, but that's about all this product has going for it.  The software is a nightmare.  The print previews only vaguely represent the finished product, and the program frequently and randomly alters your image.  I wound up using the labels, but creating the documents in MS publisher.  what a shame 
 Huge Camouflage fan!  So, needless to say, I was very excited to learn that there was a best of cd/dvd compination available.  I have been into the group from the very beginning, but unfortunately, had never seen many of their videos.  Thanks MTV.  Anyway, I ordered Rewind-The Best of 95-87 to catch up on all the videos that I had never seen.  I received the disc and promptly placed it into my dvd player (Panasonic).  It would not play the disc, "unable to read format".  OK, I tried my second dvd/vcr combo, it will play anything.....no, not this time.  "Format: Unrecognizable".  I tried the disc on three other players (Samsung, Hitachi, and a portable Sony), all to no avail.  I finally placed it in my iMac, my last hope.  It said that it would not read as a dvd, but it could play it in another format.  Meaning, it will play the disc, but as a computer image, not as a true dvd.  The picture was very small and quite grainy.  So I still got to see the videos, but not in the format that I had hoped.  I just wanted to pass this information on to other fans of the band.  It is a risky purchase, and a pricey one at that 
 Gives basic overview of exercises with mini-weights that probably won't get you the beach body you want.   There are better, more realistic books out there (ie: Body-for-LIFE, Sculpting Her Body Perfect). If you're the type who reads Shape magazine, you may like it. If you're a Muscle & Fitness Hers or FitnessRX reader, you will think it's lame 
 Anytime anyone stands up and writes logically about abortion, the people who want to change the laws based on their religious beliefs start  slandering both the facts and the character of the writers. Read this book for yourself, then check out the historical facts.  Abortion is not for everyone. Banning abortion is not for everyone. Each religious organization should set standards for their own adherants. The rest of us do not have to follow them. 
 Hey, congratulate me; I made it through 90 pages.  My main complaint is the swearing.  Good grief, once it started it was non-stop (I only checked the first five or so pages when I picked it up in the bookstore).  I would never be friends with such a foul-mouthed toad.  It should have been an enjoyable book, but it went nowhere.  The uncomplicated development took place in maybe the first ten pages and then the story should have gotten underway, but didn't.  It never started, never went anywhere.  Let's hope Anne Tyler can keep being entertaining.  Or try a children's book.  Saffy's Angel by Hilary McKay is funny 
 steer clear.  This movie suffers from terminal SCS... Shaky Camera Syndrome, the latest thing nowadays to make a movie look cool.  Not only does that leave you disturbed physically, but it distracts you from what could be crucial elements of the story, such as Giovanni Ribisi's family history, which they also manage to screw up, leaving you really not caring if he wins or loses in the end.  Pile on top of that the awful acting and the extremely poor casting choices of Ben Affleck and Vin Diesel, and you have a waste of time.  As for Giovanni Ribisi, he's ok in this movie, but go buy/rent Heaven with him and Cate Blanchett 
 I dont know how many people are aware of this but Betty Buckley played the girlfriend of Robert Redford's character. This was during her run on Broadway of Sunset Boulevard.  Because of the length of the film, all her scenes were cut. I would love to see the deleted scenes of those on a DVD. Then maybe I would buy it. 
 We use Gallup at my workplace.  Gallup is an excellent organization and we're better for working with them.  However, this was too much.  It's not a book.  It's a brochure.  Their Engagement Index is brilliant, but you can skim the other 260 pages without missing anything important.    
 This book is totally outdated, not detailed enough, and completely vague. I had to refer to other advertising books when I read this book because it was so BAD! Everthing in this book was really vague and the authors contradict themselves. One minute they reccommend a particular stragety--the next minute they say the strategy doesn't work--therefore it becomes confusing and not detailed enough. Do not buy this book because it is a waste of money and it is completely outdated--old school information, which is useless 
 You really can't drink coffee from the mugs which come with this coffeemaker, unless the lids are off the mug... a definite design defect which defeats the purpose of a travel mug.  It is a very simple oversight: there is no "vent" hole in the mug's lid, so that coffee barely dribbles out of the sipping hole, even when the mug is full, and even if you tilt the mug as high as if you were drinking the last drops from the bottom of the mug.  It is a very frustrating experience.  Please also consider that the two cups may not fill up evenly as the coffee brews; one may slightly overflow while the other mug is not full.  Then there is the instruction book.  The English is fine, but does it really make sense to instruct the user to heat up the mugs first with hot water, and then to instruct the user to measure cold water into the same mug to fill the reservoir?  Of course, the user can figure his way around that, but the only way to use these mugs would be to drill an extra pinhole in each mug's lid for venting, or just use the mug around the house, without the lid.  The mug is comfortable to hold, but the thermal value is not too good, even when preheated with boiling water. I regret having made this purchase 
 The studio should have invested more in the film to dvd transfer, the colors are a real disaster especially in "The Gang's All here". I whish I could ask for a refund. You know now what to expect.. 
 Geeeez, I picked up a couple of books by Ms Miles and looked through them today.  I was going to buy my wife some reading material that was both infomative and entertaining.  Not this woman. I'd like to keep my wife sane, happy, and not a man hater.   Actually, I do feel sorry for the far left radical feminist extremists who see the world through man-hating scenarios.  They must be very miserable.  They are mean. 
 As other reviewers have noted, this book is not exactly what you may be expecting.  Don't expect to see concrete suggestions on how to clear clutter, or perhaps ways of staying organized.  This book is really a strange new age religious book.  It will briefly touch upon reality, such as: junk in a corner will distract us when we walk into a room.  Yes, this makes sense.  Or perhaps that cleaning up clutter will improve your mood in your home.  This also makes sense.  However, then we enter "Crazy Karen" land.  Karen can smell the taint of clutter when she enters a house.  In fact, she can tell if your house is cluttered by smelling you.  Yes, outside of your home, she can sense the clutter.  That is how in-tune she is with the spirit world.  Instead of just cleaning up the clutter, you probably should get out some sacred candles, walk the mystic circle 4 times, and use a special clutter clearing chant to get rid of the negative vibes which will cause clutter to appear.  Over all, I don't think the chants are necessary to clean a house, nor that mystical spirits are causing me to drop my clothes in a pile near my closet.  It just happens.  In either case, if you believe her, or think she's a nutcase, I still think the book won't be all that inspiring.  It very rarely touches on concrete suggestions, and then moves onto the next topic without giving you a real answer.  It is a "feel good" book, but not one which should be relied upon to help you solve a problem 
 I believe this book  makes a valid point for the pularity of companies today.  There are just enough tidbits to make the read worthwhile.  However,  I found the book frustrating.  The author suffers from disclipine.  He makes poor use of analogies and the book, while chock full of examples, could many times be examples of the contra opionion: diversification.  The author would benifit from application of scientific rigor that would add depth and credibility to his copious but superficial use of examples. Perhaps exploring a corporate strategy of diversification would of given him the credibility I needed to swallow all his claims.  Without it he comes off as someone who makes up his mind what position he wants and then grasps anything possible to support his ideal. For those interested in the subject I relay the maxim, "Concentrate when in control otherwise diversify.&quot 
 This book is trash written by a man with no faculty for research and no clear understanding of the subject. First define eccentric people as unconventional  types who are healthy, happy and functional (unhappy, nonfunctional types are after all neurotic- not eccentric).  Then make the astounding discovery that eccentrics are happier,healthier and more functional than the average.  If this sounds like science to you then you might enjoy the book.    The author fails to distinguish between eccentrics who  don't care about conformity , and those unfortunates who are grossly deluded or constitutionally incapable of conformity.  The author fails to recognise cold-blooded social sarcasm as oppposed to eccentricity.    As an experienced eccentric I  found the book  poorly thought out, self contradictory, and somewhat patronizing 
 I suppose this book is valuable if you are in Public Relations, or want to learn more about that field. However, I was looking for something more related to the Internet and CRM, and this is not it 
 We got this for our shower. Our son is now 2 and the only thing we've used is the nail clippers. Which I actually really like the shape of them cause they are a lot easier to hold then just the tiny clippers, especially if baby starts to squirm a little. I couldn't even tell you where the rest of it is. The spoon thing and dropper for the medicine is cheap and useless. Any baby medication you buy you'll get a dropper for which works way better. The bulb didn't work well at all, just keep the one you get in the hospital, those work best! And if my little guy was sick he didnt appreciate having to sit still while I tried to take his temp. I recomend a therma scan for that. Just a quick beep in the ear and your good to go.  So basicly, I would recommend to pass on this item and just get a pair of nail clippers. 
 For me, this encyclopedia has a  misleading title in that most of the entries deal with vampires or vampire-like creatures. There is some material on werewolves & other shapeshifters and skinwalkers, but I found myself wondering where those 'Other Monsters' were. The author dedicated several pages to the 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' television series and the author Anne Rice while only giving a nod to classics such as 'Carmilla' and not even a mention of the 'Creature from the Black Lagoon' - and the only mention of Dr. Frankenstein or his monster is an entry for 'Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman'. There are also entries for Dion Fortune and Aleister Crowley - people who may have been involved in the occult but who were hardly monsters. Noticeably absent, especially in the presence of vampire and monster -portraying actors, is Vincent Price. Overall, I can only recommend this book in good conscience if you're a vampire fan. Otherwise, it will only disappoint 
 I agree with the first reviewer,"Cindy"--I love the concept, but the proportions on this swaddler just aren't right, unless you have a really tiny baby or one that doesn't kick his/her legs much (my one-month old boy weighs 11 lbs and is 23 inches long.).  The velcro doesn't hold because the patches are too small, and the knit fabric is too stretchy.  However, I put him in the larger size SwaddleMe today, and it fits much better 
 The plot is ridiculous. The characters make absurd decisions that have me screaming at the book and teeming with anger. We are supposed to believe that Hank is a "normal, good" person who commits evil acts out of necessity, but really there are many other more logical, non-criminal steps that could be taken. He continually chooses the immoral path. I totally hate this book and the only reason I gave it two stars is because I am still reading it. Obviously if I hate it, but continue to read it, there is something in it that won't let me put it down. Maybe that was Smith's objective all along. 
 I would like to believe that this hub works well- but I wouldn't know.  I bought it to reduce clutter on my desk from all my devices hooking into my powermac.  I hooked up my printer, ipod and digital camera and nothing happened.  I called Targus and they said I needed an a/c adaptor.  It doesn't come with one and doesn't say anything about one in the manual or instructions, or their website.  They said I could get it at radio shack and gave me the info (5 volt, 2.1 amp, center positive).  I've been to two radio shacks and online- they don't carry it.  I'm upset.  Any advice 
 This book is not clearly written.  Many terms are used incorrectly or in a very questionable manner.  The answers in the back of the book for all odd-numbered "homework" problems and all test questions is very helpful and convenient.  If I were chosing a textbook, it would not be this 
 This book is for those pastors who are wanting new insights and resources for ministering to a postmodern society.  The strength of these authors' writing is their dedication to ministering to the postmodern concept of family.  However, they state, "Our definition of family is more empirical than ideological.  It takes `what is' seriously before affirming `what should be.'" I am saddened that these authors have acquiesced to the social norm and are suggesting that the church do the same.    These authors suggest divorce rituals in which religious communities gather around the divorcing member or member couple and offer a public and spiritual occasion for "redefining" their relationship. As if divorce isn't easy enough, now the church can simply redefine things.  What kind of message does this send to our youth, as well as to other people who are struggling to keep their marriages together?   They also fall into the trap of defining family as "anything anyone wants to make it."  Yes, this is the "way it is" in society but we will fall into complete familial anarchy if the church abandons what God has established for the family.  They state, "It's a social fact that lesbian and gay couples establish enduring partnerships as stable and long lived as many marriages.  What is most congruent with Gospel values - to ignore such life-giving faithful commitments or to offer recognition, blessing, and the support of the wider Christian family?"    They even give instruction to the church for dealing with cohabitating couples.  They propose that choosing to live together even without a wedding is a commitment and that the church should welcome them as members, but they suggest caution in putting these folks in "role model" positions such as teachers of children or advisors of youth groups; as if one has to be a teacher or advisor to be a role model.  We are all role models, regardless of our position or function in the body.  It may be a new day for family ministry, but it is a sad day for the church if we allow society to define us.      
 Self proclamation does not a doctor make.  Dr Laura's credential's are not within the field of psychotherapy-she who preaches so loudly from her pulpit about family ties and togetherness, has been estranged from her own family for years.  She who points the finger---has also had the finger pointed at her.  Posing nude, living with a man without the benefit of marriage, having an affair, becoming pregnant without the benefit of marriage, have all been written about Dr. Laura Schlessinger and made public.  Noone willingly takes the advice of a hypocrite, unless of course, they hide behind a syndicated radio show and a willing agent 
 I agree with David Thomson when he says few audiences in the West would be content to view an American epic composed solely of battles and their contexts. Kurosawa was a keen businessman and his reputation in the West was entrenched with "Kagemusha" and "Ran", he knew what (American) audiences think of as heroic and mystical about "historical" Japan: Kurosawa's art takes a great deal on its impetus from what Americans (or Westerners) imagine about Japan. He was not popular in Japan (where they thought his stuff was particularly hokey and outmoded, hence the suicide attempt). I am not saying that the work is rubbish - there is no "ugly" shot in either "Ran" or "Kag" - merely that there are more "authentically Japanese" films out there to choose from.   
 This is a badly written, repetitive and self-serving account, largely, of the foolishness of "portflio insurance." That things which are "just like" something else may not be so in reality, and that  magic fixes in the market (which after all fly in the face of the  rational-expectations/efficient-market hypotheses which often are built  into the view of the market being relied on) I guess needs to be pointed  out regularly, since hope of quick, uninformed, and painless fixes seem to  reoccur with each new wave of financial charlatans and the greed they feed  on. Jacobs does point out such problems for a particular, rather bizarre  episode, and suggests, not too coherently, that such "scams" are  still prevalent. However, He does this in a horribly repetitive and  self-laudatory way that is not really very clearly argued 
 Jones has the kind of cheek to make almost anything medieval seem fresh and exciting - however, for truly incisive, biting and dead-on accurate contemporary political and cultural commentary read Christopher Hitchens. If we could find a way to weaponize Hitchen's intellectual and verbal firepower within a missile system there would be no more to fear from Hamas, Hezbollah, Al Quaeda, the Baathists, Syrian and Iranian insurgents, or any other group only too happy to strap bombs onto their children and send them into a crowd of civilians.   Read Hitchens, period, literally for anything!    
 Words need not even be wasted on this product. Besides each character having a different voice than that in the movie, the audio effects are terrible, as well as the actors and script. The one good thing about this product is its availability is limited. Save your time, save your money. Don't let Lucas put his hand in your pocket 
 This book was recommended for me by Amazon and I am glad I took it out from the library instead of buying it. It took me a long time to get through the book and I found that I forced myself to finish reading it. The main character is hard to relate to or even sympathize with. And at the end of the book I feel that nothing has been resolved. I would not recommend this book. 
 It just seemed like someone opened an encyclopedia and started copying from it. The book was also too "one sided", I think it is ok to talk about the not so positive aspects of a company without making the company out to be a villain. It felt like a 329 page "feel good" ad 
 I came to this book very interested in knowing more about Ho and to see this period of history told from the perspective of a figure not normally viewed as a major player.  Having previously read Paul Preston's biography of Franco (a long book), I was hoping this would be of similar quality (see my review of Preston's book).  It's not.  This book is very detailed.  As one of the other reviewers notes, there are specifics about all sorts of travels and meetings with all sorts of names, places, and times.  But, nothing really ties these things together to make a story.  It's so bad that I haven't finished the book and probably never will.  So, why 2 stars instead of a total blast of 0 or 1 star?  Because I do believe the author has been thorough and so this deserves some respect.  I just wish there had been an editor or someone to help turn this into a story.  And the final plug:  Preston's book about Franco is really good 
 It arrived in a timely manner in excellent condition. I would not hesitate to use this vendor again.   
 Why will I give generously only 2 stars ? Because this book is an exact copy of the beautiful book on Architecture from Ron von der Meer. Same size, same model. Of course different pop-ups, but badly made, opening with a too much easy and wellknown pop-up of a Pyramid. I agree with M. Langton about the very bad Chrysler Building. All around the book, ridiculous thin paper folding without any interest. At the end of the book, there is a thick box with no use. Where von der Meer in the same kind of box did put a lot of nice things to use in it. No, this book does absolutly not deserve it's extremly high expensive price, compare to the quality and low price of the last Sabuda's book. One must say that the chinese are actually the best pop-up maker regarding quality.   
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 First Edition of this book is a 40+ year old publication that first sold for $3.95 in 1964, now the current edition goes for $75?  Why?  Because it is still used in college classes.  This is really dated material. HOWEVER, because the newest Edition (6th - 2003) costs up to $75 new, some clowns here through  Amazon.com are trying to sell you an older Edition for prices ranging from $25 to $65 making it look like you are getting a "good deal" on the more expensive 6th Edition.  The problem is that they then send you a 1st , 2nd or 3rd Edition, all of which are only worth between $5-10 each!   Buyer BEWARE here!  If you are paying $25 or more for this 6th Edition, MAKE SURE THAT YOU GET A 6th EDITION!  Inform Amazon.com ASAP if they send you something else 
 Kevin Trudeau leads his readers into believing they will get the solutions they are looking for but when the time for presenting them comes, he sends his readers to his website where they have to pay an outrageous membership fee. He condemns those who are out to make money at our expense then turns around does the same thing.  I give it two stars because there is some knowledge to be gained but no solution unless you are willing to pay.  A big disappointment 
 I purchased this book excitedly, because of the paucity of reading material directed at someone like me- a 43 year old, first time mother via infertility treatments, with a long and successful professional career.  Then I started reading, and my excitement deflated.   I don't think she was really committed to anything other than publishing a compilation of forced hilarity sit-com entries.   I thought her style was trying to emulate Ann Lamott....but with the cynical, savvy-New York City angle (Sex-In-the-City with babies and their poo), and without the heart or introspection that make Lamotts "Operating Instructions" so precious.   How does this book represent good writing?   She has not communicated so much to us... her motivation to get pregnant without the support of her husband, the complicated reasons why she has a very unconventional life, why she accepts incompetence from her contractor, why she is cowed by a Nanny.  I suspect it could be more interesting if we, again, got a peak at some real heart here.  Instead we get to read about how much money she can spend (except...well..not on a CRIB or DIAPERS...her friends/family have to come up with that for her after the babies are born), Manalo Blahnick shoes and exquisite catering...its often a very superficial and disappointing read that I basically slogged through. I have no doubt Ms. Newman is a wonderful mother and partner who deeply loves her children and husband...and I would have liked to read about that side of her, and that can be done with humor interfaced with self exploration.   If she had gone just a few shades deeper she could have made a very engaging book for many of us, especially if she was less enamored with her fabulous lifestyle and more committed to an internal journey.   But hey, this is 2005.  We don't ask for depth and character anymore. We're satisfied with a yuk.  
 Read this book first, and then read "For your own good:  Hidden Cruelty in Child-Rearing and the Roots of Violence" by Alice Miller.  In it she describes what happens when you follow the advice described in "The Strong-Willed Child".  She describes the child-rearing methods in place in Germany at the turn of the last century.    The similarities of those methods with the ones described in this book (focus on absolute obedience by use of force) are chilling.  I know from my German background the fruits of child-rearing methods that use violent methods to ensure obedience to authority.  Especially when coupled with an available scape-goated minority already disliked by a majority of the population.  Yes, pain and humiliation will create a child submissive to your authority in the here and now.  But do you want that for your child, or for your society?    And most importantly, for the Christian parent, get a red-letter Bible and read the words of Jesus.  Read Matthew chapters 5 - 7.  
 After consuming everything Hillerman has written, and learning something new about Native American culture from each book, and after Hillerman's squib on the Dust jacket, my expectations were set so far above what this trite book delivered that even two stars seems kind... As a 1/8 Arapaho [& 1/8 Blackfoot] i had hoped to learn something about their life.  The characterizations were also paper thin, including both the male and female protagonists... and the denouement was telegraphed for miles... ergo, even as a mystery/suspense novel, this one flunked 
 While this book is a decent size for a graphic novel , the scenes are rushed, just as something is heating up , it moves on. The artwork,  although color, is just average for detail, try Paris Quinn or Duvet if you're looking for something a little more exciting 
 I was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in 2004.  I was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie, but it was really lackluster.    The acting is wooden, the script is very lame, and worst of all, the action isn't very exciting.  I expected a much better movie from director Richard Donner.  There is a battle scene, and there are action scenes, but they just aren't exciting.  When the action isn't exciting, you better have a good story.  The story here is alright, but certainly not enough to save the movie.  I don't hate any of the actors, they are decent when they have something to work with.  Here they had nothing to work with, so they obviously didn't do too well this time.  This really isn't worth your time.  I gave this to the thrift shop after I got it, and I feel sorry for the person who bought it there 
 Quite bluntly, "Chasing Amy" is a terrible movie; one I never would have gotten through had I not decided to drink a beer. I'm only giving it a generous two stars because as a NJ ex-pat myself, I could take a certain pleasure in the feeling that I've "escaped". Escaped from the crudeness, hostility, shallowness, insensitivity, provincialism and faux-hipness that that part of the country represents to me, among other things. Never mind the seriously flawed-&-full-of holes plot; these characters have some severe anger & hatred issues, especially the "Banky" person, (not to mention the twisted "Jay" creature).   I pity anyone for whom the ambience of "Chasing Amy" reflects reality as they know it and live it 
 A mediocre, intellectually lazy piece of work that will be of moderate value to beginners. Its basic points are valuable to those who have not been exposed to this structure, but it sorely lacks depth, committment to its subject, or the information value to hold the interest of a reader of above average mental capacity.  
 We've used this rice cooker not more than 3 times. It was put away and we forgot about it for a few months and then realized that we were eating lots of rice, why not cook in the rice cooker. When we took it out to use it, it was dead. Does not work at all. I've had good experiences with Black & Decker before, but this one sure wasn't. Would not buy this or any other B&D rice cooker again 
 I was expecting something positive, since I have enjoyed several of John Edward's other books; but this was so bad I was disheartened that he went through with having it published at all.  The characters are not well developed, the plot is uninspired and the massive intervention from the "other side" is so deus ex machina that it isn't even believable as fiction 
 Save your money on this one. They ALWAYS seem to skirt the issue as to HOW right now. I'd recommend getting Personal Power II by Anthony Robbins - they both teach relatively the same work, but with diff. words - semantics  some would say 
 All of these books that keep popping up saying you can do the math in your mind in seconds, are correct in one way.  Yes, you can do it...in fact you can do pretty massive equations using #'s in the millions or below, (or higher).  The thing that is terrible about all of these books is they sound like a modern day memory book or such.  They are ALL based upon what is called Vedic math.  It was the math form used thousands of years ago...generally dating around the Summerian culture.   Vedic math really does work...in fact it's quite mind-blowing to put out answers to a large group of #'s just as someone finishes reading the problem! : )  Check out websites based upon Vedic math, or buy books directly relating to Vedic math...there's more to it than just putting it in print 
 I was disappointed with this DVD. Other reviewers made it out to be an amazing performance, but I have a feeling they're just sending underseved praise to their favorite band. The performance is mediocre, at best. As a matter of fact, it's clear that the band is holding back, A LOT. Perhaps the guys knew they were being filmed for a live DVD, and took extra care not to mess up any of the songs, but the performance suffers as a result. There's far less intensity in this performance than in other live performances, or even in the CD recordings. Dan doesn't even bother attempting some of the more difficult licks in a lot of the songs. The lighting is also another sore spot on this performance. There's a crazy red tinge to everything that makes it difficult to see the band and almost hurts your eyes after a while.  That said, this DVD does have a lot of nice extras if you're a big fan of the band. There's interviews, music videos, photos, and the sound quality is excellent, but the performance itself is severely lacking in intensity and quality. If you're crazy into the Black Keys you'll probably want to pick this up, but if you're just the average fan, pass this one by 
 The book is an absolute disgust. Has NOTHING to do with the reality,  misrepresents facts in every single chapter. Not worth reading, just a waste of time. Author should familiarize himself with the basic facts before writing on the subject. Very unprofessional and poorly written 
 It's not just that this film is a bloated remake of a quick, clean, near-perfect minimalist thriller. It's not that much of the added material (particularly the internal affairs sub-plot) feels tacked-on and unnecessary. It's not even that Pacino's character is a toned-down shell of the dangerously off-kilter detective of the original, that one of the more complicated characters (Frya Selmer/Tanya Francke) has been reduced down to set dressing, or that the ending ruins the film's moral atmosphere. It's the fact that Nolan, a sublimely talented director, is unable to coax a believable performance from any of his leads. Pacino does the method-acting bit again, taking it over the top in every single scene; Hilary Swank plays a pale imitation of her better roles as the down-to-earth hometown girl; and Robin Williams--well, he's Robin Williams. The kids in this film, Katharine Isabelle and Jonathan Jackson, turn in fine performances that, while hardly career-makers (which they couldn't be, considering how far their roles have been pared down), are a refreshing change of pace from their adult contemporaries' mugging. See the film for their far-too-short performances, but make sure you rent it, and don't pay too much to do so 
 Unfortunately I cannot join the chorus of admiration for this episode since the premise and execution is so one-dimensional. Perhaps the tragic element to the fate of Robert Culp's character, a scientist picked out of a hat to undergo a surgical transformation into an alien for the world to unite in defense against, might have had more resonance for me if the performance of his wife by Geraldine Brooks wasn't so Joan Crawford-ish. As it is their scenes together, particularly one where she cradles his head, have an odd mother-son tone, which is funny since the idea of her being pregant is repeatedly raised. Calling the shop they visit From Here to Maternity is a nice touch. What isn't considered is that if Culp had impregnated Brooks after begininng the transformation procedures, wouldn't that have an effect on her unborn child? Based on how Culp turns out as the alien, at least we know the kid will be damn tall. It's a pity actually that we're never given a clear view of Culp's alien get-up, since it looks quite remarkeable, and an improvement after the ludicruous amphibian of Tourist Attraction. This episode has a major plot hole, which is probably more obvious since the material is so shallow - why do the scientists need to duplicate the alien when they already have one captured which everyone seems to be terrified of, though it looks as threatening as a stuffed toy monkey? I suppose we're to think these architects are limited both by their fear, and their lack of expertise since their alien is downed so easily. Except for his awful over-acting in the "schizophrenic episode" scene, where he performs a dazzling jump into a wall shelf and seems to discover the method ramble simultaneously, Culp underplays and even gets a laugh when asked how he feels after surgery, and he responds depressed. There are some camp touches as well - Brooks hit with a symbiotic feeling of pain, when she is walking in the street, the stock footage of crowds running in the street in the opening movie, the way the trio of backwood hunters are framed together a la Ingmar Bergman, and the intense performance of Leonard Stone. Re the symbiotic thing, I liked a cut from panic in surgery when breathing stops, to Brooks head-tossed-back crying as she clears out Culp's office 
 its a waste of money. i own several celtic mythology books. this one is poorly organized and only gives summaries of the myths. not good. would not buy again. there are better books out there.. oh and comparing it to the Egyptian Book of the Dead is just misleading. One thing good about it is the pictures are very pretty. kids will love that part. 
 A Perfect Spy is a complex novel, very difficult to film because it is essentially a psychological exploration rather than any sort of conventional narrative, much less a spy story. What one makes of the film will depend largely on how one reacts to Peter Egan as Magnus Pym. For my taste, he was absolutely awful, and he was hardly helped by the plodding direction. The only way Egan seemed capable of displaying the character's inner life (what the film is really about)was to grin throughout like a demented hyena, which was then forced upon the viewer in suffocating close-ups, a sure sign of a hack director. The script is intelligent, and the rest of the cast is first-rate, but hardly helped by a director who insists upon the sort of pretentious "pregnant pauses" that destroy all sense of natural pacing. The middle episodes are the best. The last two are interminable. There is no suspense really about the ultimate outcome, but what should be an intense and riveting experience leading up to the inevitable denoument instead becomes a boring caricature of psychological disintegration. I was seriously disappointed in this work 
 Someone named "NDB" (and I'm willing to bet a princely sum of money that he goes by "NDBoston" in certain other online venues...ahem) hit it right on the head.  There is no curse.  There never was.  Glad that the phantasm of a curse managed to put Dan Shaughnessy's kids through college OK, but the Red Sox have had damned good reasons why they've lost over the years, and none of them has to do with ghosts, specters, curses or other figments of the imagination.  None of which takes away from the unbridled joy that we all feel in Red Sox Nation at this wonderful, beautiful championship.    (By the way, NDB, Shank is still gonna prime that pump.  Check this site for enthralling details of the windy-titled "Legend of the Curse of the Bambino," due to hit stores in May, and deep-discount racks in July or August at the latest.)  
 In this instance the author peppers the book with snide asides about Christianity and Catholicism,politics,the Communists were "never a threat," and, of course, Ronald Reagan made bad deals for his Screen Actors Guild.  If they were so bad, why was he elected president of the SAG twice? Overall the book is well written, but there are enough errors I am aware of to make me wonder about the validity of the purported facts outside of my limited knowledge of Jimmy Stewart.  Politics is fine except when it is unsubstantiated conjecture 
 In spite of all the moralizing, the whining, and the handwringing, he just keeps doing it. . . and doing it . . . and doing it . . . for the money!  The historical record is really valuable, though disgusting, and I actually recommend reading it for that purpose.  But the gorge rises in your throat about the human being.  I'd encountered John Perkins in his persona as "shuar shaman," actually once attended an all-day seminar of his in the nineties, and wondered where he got the money to live that life style.  Well, now we know 
 I thought this would be just the ticket for my 6 year old crafter. Wrong! I spent 15 minutes trying different angles, pressures, speeds, nothing helped. Still popped out looking like I tore it out of the paper. Stylus button must be pushed hard and long to do anything. Must be used under adult supervision as the point could be very dangerous. It is a very fine metal point that could just as easily perforate skin. Both of my daughters tried it. The six year old spent about 10 minutes, with me assisting her every other minute because she got so frustrated with it trying to get it to work "right". She is no longer interested in using it. My 14 year old tried it, had the same problems that I did. She is no longer interested. I would give this item ZERO stars if I could. I doubt this item will be on the market very long 
 I hate lawyers.  What is a lawyer, anyway? Basically: it's a telemarketer in a decent suit, a guy who would be hawking the latest Ronco Hair-in-a-Can super-duper late night special to folks in Akron over his plantronic headset, only he won the genetic lottery and got shot out of an upper-middle class womb.   Shakespeare said it first and best: "First, let's kill all the lawyers!". Former Enron uber-dealmaker John Wing put a little fast-times Houston spin on that one: "get all the lawyers in a room---and shoot 'em!---in the mouth, so you *can't* miss!"   Exactly. Anyway, "The Firm" is a flick that purports to make the world of high-priced yappers jaw-rippingly exciting, so I was probably all amped up to despise it.   But not really: back before I dug into a gig with the Dark Side in high finance, back when I was hefting a backpack over the sodden campus of my old alma mater, I briefly considered going into law: briefly, for about an hour. It was a desperate time, and I needed money.   Why did I consider walking Hell's Highway, if only for an instant? Because John Grisham, boring lawyer-turned-ripping-potboiler-writer-turned-back-into-boring-lawyer, a kind of Tom Clancy for the paper-pusher and green-eyeshade set, made it all sound pretty damned funky (and lucrative! Hey, dig that BMW 7 series, baby, beep beep!) in his engrossing little novel "The Firm": granted, I've read better prose on the backs of cereal boxes, but it held my attention.   I mean, seriously: you're 19, and the whole flying out on the corporate Lear to Grand Cayman and switching out briefcases full of cash sounds kinda cool. And strippers, man, plenty of strippers. Oh, and did someone mention a BMW?  What's the difference between a lawyer and a snake? The snake at least has the decency to hiss before it sinks its fangs into your a**.   Now it's true: Grisham writes like Kim Jong Il sings, but---in "The Firm", anyway---he was a master craftsman at moving things along at a bristling pace, from the pedestrian---hotshot Law School whiz kid gets picked up by a Memphis white-shoe law firm---to the Pretty Damned Atrocious, all while keeping the pressure ratcheted up with a dense, suffocating sense of malice.   Grisham, like Michael Crichton, isn't a prose genius: he's not even mediocre. But he writes for film, and "The Firm" cried out for cinematic treatment.   So it's baffling that, with all the right Stuff---Tom Cruise as winsome lead Mitch McDeere, Gene Hackman doing his chain-drinking Gene Hackman thang as the corrupt (but ultimately worn-out and pathetic) senior partner, and Sydney Pollack helming it up---that the big-screen treatment of "The Firm" is such a yawner.   Talk about contempt of court.  Pollack takes all that intricately woven little Grisham-plot and barfs big ugly chunks of it up on the screen. At its guts, really, "The Firm" was really nothing more than the Big Career Nightmare: I've bet the farm on this gig, I'm getting big money, I'm working like a fiend, my wife is having trouble remembering my name, and evidently I'm not doing tax-deals for loaded clients---I'm doing money laundering for The Mob.   Pollack just mangles the whole thing, convolutes the simple, and renders up a flick that will have you checking your watch and yawning. Casting is part of the problem: Cruise does his thing, running around Memphis with his briefcase. Hackman drinks a lot and exudes pure Armani-clad sleaze: "The Firm" is all funny-wrinkles when he's onscreen, but hey, a man can only do so much.   Jeanne Tripplehorn (Cruise's squeeze), who plays Lara San Giacomo when she's not playing Tripplehorn (seriously, google the two of 'em: astounding!) is a bitter old battleaxe who made me want to stick forks in my eyes. Wilford Brimley is just plain wrong as The Firm's security chief: too bald, too cracker, too rotund, too silly, too low-end, to do the role justice.   Holly Hunter is even worse: Hunter is one of those eighties thangs who got pumped up as Something Sexy, which is baffling, given that she's about 3'8, and has all the sex appeal of an Oompah-Loompah. It doesn't help that she's a big, ugly Southern stereotype, the caricature most denizens of dumpy Michigan towns imagine Southerners to be. You want her to die: she doesn't. Pollack wants us to think she's clever and funny. She isn't.   Ed Harris, I think, is in this movie. So is Hal Holbrook, which kinda ruins everything, because everytime Hal Holbrook is in a movie you know you're dealing with a bunch of friggin' crooks.    Anyway, the coup de grace to the stupidity is the entrance, Deus Ex Machina, of Paul Sorvino (Don Morolto---what kind of Goombah name is dat, anyway? Somebody call Tony Soprano!), who takes this juggernaut of boredom from the merely stupid to the totally ridiculous.   If you wanna see Tom Cruise running around Memphis with his briefcase for two hours, by all means belly up to the bar.   Otherwise, case dismissed.   JS 
 This 1987 thriller focuses on Norman Johnson, a psychologist who specializes in large disasters like plane crashes.  As the novel opens he is being taken to an undisclosed site by the US Navy.  Johnson learns that the crash site is located 1000 feet under the South Pacific and the craft is some sort of a space craft.  He was been included because of work he did sometime before organizing a first contact team for a previous administration, an assignment that Johnson would just as soon forget.  Once the team is taken to the Navy deep sea facility and begins to study the craft Johnson begins to find disturbing circumstances - that the Navy commander has been less than honest with both the team and his superiors and that the craft itself bears a remarkable similiarity to current human technology, labels and directions are even written in English, leading the team to question just how alien this technology really is.  The suspense continues to build as the undersea facility loses their support ships above due to inclement weather and then conditions in the facility itself begins to turn hostile.  This novel is quite predictable, just a few pages into the story it is obvious to anyone who has ever seen a disaster movie that there will be no comforting support ships nearby, that the undersea environment will become threatening, there will be many deaths, there will be sexual tension between the hero and someone else and so on.  While there is some slight redemption in the last few pages this book is a big disappointment, Crichton is capable of so much more.  If you are a fan read it but be forewarned, if you are unfamiliar with his work begin with anything but this.  
 Our microwave went out and this was the replacement. It is just what we wanted and needed. The company was excellent to deal with 
 1. Watch the movie "Hustle & Flow." The handful of songs that are played all the way through sound good, especially the catchy and smooth "It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp" and "Hustle and Flow."  2. Get CD soundtrack to film. Discover to unpleasant surprise that virtually all of the songs on it are operating on the mental level of "Whoop That Trick." (That is to say, a very low IQ level, with endlessly repetitive choruses that aren't catchy.)  3. Realize that amongst the professional rappers on the soundtrack, the best one is professional actor Terrence Howard.  4. Smile bemusedly. Sell used CD 
 There are great songs here, but you're better off hearing the live versions on Songs In The Attic, or any of his other live discs. The problem here is the sound quality (probably of the original recordings) is very poor. Clearly, you can tell that great things were ahead for the relative unknown singer-songwriter 
 This movie is the worst ever it has nothing to do with shaolin stuff, it's a story about a cop who got stuck with a ghost and it has bad acting,stupid story and not funny at all, so it's nothing at all like shaolin soccer so you better save your money 
 While I've seen worse films, few films that I have ever seen combine action, comedy, and dialog as sloppy as this overlong, over-loud, over-stupid, over-profanic, and over-offensive piece. The editing on the action scenes, which are frequent, is undiniably bad, making them frustrating and nausiating to watch. The movie's comedy all falls flat, and is often offensive and mean spirited. The dialog is incomprehesibly bad; I don't mind that there's a lot of profanity, I mind that profanity is used to be sick, mean, and stupid. The plot from the begining is just a throwaway. From the beginging with, of all things, a drug bust on a KKK group, with frequent use of the N word to try to be funny, and an action scene like all the preceding others that half the time one can't tell where another person is shooting, I knew it was bad. Why, oh why, does this movie clog over two hours? It should have been 90 minutes max, but even if it had been I'd still be saying the same things. Terrible film. 
 Yes, this quote is actually a subheading on page 23 (it's true! I'm not creative enough to make this stuff up).  Needless to say, "Knights & Castles" is so politically correct and anti-Christian that it boggles the mind that it could get published.  Still wondering? Here are some random quotes to help you decide if your child is ready for his ideological cleansing:   "Have you ever noticed TV ads for boys' and girls' toys? Do they make boys seem macho and girls seem weak and frilly? Is a girl less feminine if she is strong? Is a boy less masculine if he shows he cares?" (p23)  " As you know, the middle ages was a time of great intolerance." (p54)  "Males and females are more alike than different...Women were supposed to be tender...If a woman felt strong and powerful, she was expected to hide those feelings."  (p23)  "Religion was a way to stay safe in the Middle Ages. Some young nobles probably became monks to avoid a life of endless battles." (p57)  "...some noble women and working women managed to gain power. That shows that with determined men and women, civilization can move forward even in the most oppressive times." (p22)  "The old tribal ways were seen as inferior by...church officials of the Middle Ages. In many places, tribal people are still treated with disrespect. But...Some modern scientists try to learn from native peoples...To find out more about this modern day struggle, contact: Cultural Survival 96, Mount Auburn St., etc." (p57)    That should be enough to get the flavor.  It saddens me that authors like Avery Hart (and publishers like Williamson) can't let kids be kids anymore; No! we must mold and bend their little minds to our will [insert cackling witch laughter]...hmm, maybe there was something to that burning-witches-at-the-stake tradition...    
 please, editors, tell the new writer that a given plot must be cohesive.  A friend of Qwill's is killed in an accident, a friend who is the significant other of a fellow whom Qwill has known since he, the fellow, was a youngster, and Qwill does----NOTHING!!???  Get out of town!  Also, why was that hunting accident/murder thrown in?  Where did it go?  Nowhere!  Get the new author, or authors, up to speed 
 Lahaye once again showed his weak eschatology and also shows he rehashes the poor "research" done by other bible "teachers".  While I know the pre tribulation rapture is proved in the bible, very few pre-tribulation "teachers" have studied for themselves and do not see what is clearly taught in the bible.  Instead of doing their own research, they rehash and regurgitate the poorly researched articles and books written by extremely poor researchers.  Lahaye is guilty of rehashing poor research taught by other "teachers".  Lahaye is also guilty of changing what the bible clearly teaches and has deceived millions.  One example of his false teaching is that someone can take the mark of the beast and still be saved and go to heaven.  This DOWNRIGHT LIE has deceived people into thinking that 'taking the mark' is 'no big deal'.  All his books show the tribulation is "no big deal" and people can go on living fairly normally while judgements are happening (seems he doesn't think antichrist will turn off cell phones, electricity, or internet if they refuse his mark)  I will restate that the bible clearly teaches a pretribulation rapture - only none of the 'POPULAR' bible "teachers" do their own research so they never publish the clear teachings of a pre tribulation rapture.  Lahaye has done more to deceive the world than most people do - and he will be rewarded severely for his works.  Remember - Jesus said if the world loves someone, they are not His - because the world will hate those that are His as they hate Him.  Popularity of ANY bible "teacher" should be suspect because of what Jesus said.  Lahaye is a false teacher teaching deception that closely mimics the truth (just enough to be believed by most 
 I paid $100.00 for a tube of Hylexin because I have serious dark circles.  Unfortunately, I fell for the hype because I would have tried anything that says, "Significantly reduces dark circles!"  I followed the directions and waited....NOTHING!  I teach Business Ehtics at a University.  Part of the course involves ethics in advertising.  I use the Hylexin example of how people are duped by the wording, the packaging, etc. Please take my word for it and save yourself some money 
 This novel was required for an English Writing class, and I must say that the novel serves no practical purpose what-so-ever.   By the novels end I was left wondering to what intention the author had in mind, but more-so to what reason did readers have to keep reading?  Life is short and time is valuable, and so I only choose to read novels in which something can be gained. Okay, life is not always fair, yet the show must go on...got it.  But this novel's all-too-obvious moral comes at a painfully high price; one must leave their common sense on page nineteen, only to find the storyline to be too dark, too dramatic, and a tad too driven by blind faith.   The absurd storyline is only surpassed by the countless missed opportunities to offer readers something real, something tangible, something useful.  Basically anybody can write a piece of nonsensical overkill, but who has the want or the time to read it? So Far From God, more like So Far From Good 
 There's a reason Oar flopped when it was released back in 1969: it sucks.  Thirty eight years later, with Skip Spence safely in his grave, some now give this pitiful mess *five* stars.  Since you can't give more than five stars here, they're saying Oar is on a level with masterpieces like Sergeant Pepper... Dark Side of the Moon... Led Zeppelin 4....!  Just between you and me, I think the government is still secretly drugging people.    With all due respect to Skip's venerable memory, Oar is a painful aural experience.  The first two tracks, Little Hands and Cripple Creek, are halfway good, and show some production values; but things quickly deteriorate from there.  One gets the impression the rest of Oar was cobbled together in the recording studio just prior to taping - then put in the can after only one or two takes.  Lastly, the bass playing and drumming are just awful.  Yes, it's too bad that things ended up like they did for Skip. And it's hard not to sympathize with him - he flew high only to crash hard.  But let's keep a sense of perspective: His tragedy did not translate into good music.  One extra star in his memory. 
 This book was very boring. Details in a book make it interesting but the extended details in this book made it nausiating.  This book had a very interesting plot and many good ideas but the way it was writen didnt appeal to most of the students in my school that read it. A poll was taken and about 73% of the students in the school liked this book. What does that show about the book? 
 It's probably been 15 years since I read it, and EVERY person in the years since with whom I have discussed this book has said the same thing.  It was literally a book that kept me up until 3 a.m. - and THAT is how it ends?  I'm hoping Dr. Crichton had a publishing deadline or something.  
 I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE CAST OF THIS MOVIE DRESSED UP AS HOT DOGS AND THROWN INTO A CAGE WITH STAR JONES AND MARV ALBERT. (... 
 If you're looking for a book that will give you a concise and easy to remember strategy for integrating work and fun--FISH! is the one I'd recommend.  In FUN Works, the author presents ELEVEN principles that are supposed to help us "understand the importance of the Fun/Work Fusion."  With eleven principles, this book is all over the place, and somehow misses the mark. I fervently believe that work should be FUN, but I didn't find this book particularly helpful in understanding how to make it that way 
 Here is another example of a good Commodities writer attempting to write about Day Trading Stocks. No only does he fail in this attempt but he has the nerve to criticize other writers. It is clear from the time periods of the charts (ten minuets) and the lack of discussion of NASDAQ level 2 that Jake is way out of his field. When will the pure commodity writers learn not to try and cash in on the interest in stocks? Fools rush in. Save your money.I returned the book 
 I received this as a gift because I am a huge JA fan. I read it through to the end because I read all books related to JA. I cannot believe this book has a rating of 3/5 stars. The plot, as continued by Barrett is absurd in the extreme, and, as others have pointed out, inconsistent and capricious. There is almost no dialogue, a distinct departure from Austen's usual style. A smarmy, confused, verbose narrator conveys most of the "story line." Adding insult to injury is the unnatural and awkward writing style. Barring a few grammatical constructions and vocabulary changes, Austen's language is not so different from our own. Barrett would have us believe that people, in truth, fly everywhere and use the conditional every other word. Would that eager JA readers could but be warned away from this unhappy collection of words 
 The characters are uninteresting and 2-dimensional, the dialog hackneyed. I have no idea why it's on the New York Times Bestseller list. It was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else. Don't waste your money 
 I've dared to challenge my cinema-going art student friends and uni-mates, amid heated discussions about David Lynch, Akira Kurosawa and such, by confessing that I really didn't like Magnolia at all.  I feel that PT Anderson does indeed create well-rounded characters, compelling dialogue and stuff like that.  The actors cast in his movies always deliver brilliant performances - but in the end, I really felt Magnolia fell short of something more substantial.  It dragged on way too long, the extensive scenes never really seemed to go anywhere and I felt that some serious revisions and editing would have been most beneficial.  There were twists and diversions that didn't really add anything and overall I felt like it was a waste of time which is a shame because some of the scenes featured some great and inspiring acting but maybe they were misplaced.  It didn't really have the sort of message that I couldn't have gotten from a song or another movie in less time and all the symbollic, arty stuff came across as pretentious film-student stuff.  I think PT Anderson is highly overrated as a director and his films are way too self-indulgent.  I don't think he's very good at telling a story without going overboard and sending the viewer astray.  With the exception of the performances by Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise, I thought this film was terrible 
 I read this book for school, and  we went over all the good points of this book and its literary merit, etc.  The writing style is smooth and descriptive, but I find the plot dull and trite.  She is a teen searching for love and her voice, and the story is her traveling from husband to husband and her not being satisfied.  The idea of her finding her voice is inconsistent and unfounded.  If you want to read a book about a silly girl who doesn't know what to do with herself, and if you want to be bombarded with overused symbolism, be my guest and read "Their Eyes Were Watching God" by Zora Neale Hurston.  Only read it if you are looking at the writing style, do not read it for the plot. 
 I love Ricky and I think he is great at what he does. However, this album did not meet my expectations at all. I only like 1 or 2 songs. I think Ricky could have done way better. If i could return my cd and get my money back I would. There go 15 bucks I'll never see again 
 No wonder Stephen King did not want this to be released. This movie is stupid. The original did not need a sequel at all. We all expected better, considering this was made by Mary Mambert, who made the original Pet Sematary. This is crap, so do not buy it 
 The summer of 1999, aged 15, was the day I felt my innocence shattered. I had so greatly been looking forward to this film and was so excited to have a Star Wars I could call my own (as in made in my generation) only to find out that it was a piece of garbage full of bad/flat, lifeless acting, a story full of plotholes and inconsistencies with the original trilogy and enough CGI to make your eyes bleed.  The actors, including heavy weights like Liam Neeson and Samuel L. Jackson, up and comers Natalie Portman, and gradually progressing into leading man status Ewan McGregor, are all wasted here. Neeson, McGregor and Jackson are OK but OK is all they are, but they don't stand out at all, nor does Portman. All I can say of Jake Lloyd is that he looks like he's having fun. Then there's Jar Jar Binks, ARGH. What was Lucas thinking? And poor Darth Maul got killed before we had a chance to get to know him.  But what's most offensive of all, aside from the lifeless/passionless acting, are the continuity errors. All these years we were led to believe that Obi-Wan (McGregor) risked a lot to make Anakin a Jedi Knight, but here Obi-Wan's little more than a 2nd banana lurking in the background, while Qui-Gon Jinn (Neeson) is at the front line doing what he can to get Anakin ahead, and it's just wrong. That was what hurt me the most, the fact that the film wasn't about Obi-Wan, that it didn't adhere to previous Star Wars history.  And Episode 2, alas, isn't that big of an improvement 
 Patrick Dempsey had an usual niche in the 80s teen comedy, as did the characters he played.  He was the lovable loser who just wanted to fit in, somehow ends up getting caught up in some smutty encounter or another on his quest for acceptance, but is well liked and tended to have everything mostly work out for him in the end.  Here was no acception.  He plays the lovable loser once again, this time he was an arrogant, cocky kid who blew his education by doing nothing but partying at college.  Disappointed and angry at his failing grades, his parents decide to stop supporting him and he is forced into the minimum wage workforce at a pizza place.  While Patrick is thoughly miserable working for slave labor, he encounters a beautiful, mysterious stranger who (like the plot to a bad porn movie) makes his job worth while with no strings attached.  While this fleeting encounter might have ended there, the mysterious stranger talked with her women friends about this, and soon Patrick is working as a gigalo under the guise of a pizza delivery guy.  The smutty adventures and hilarity ensue after that.  Long before Desperate Housewives he was their Afternoon Delight.  What was amazing to me in watching this movie is that Patrick didn't have sex with all the women clients he eventually aquires.  He is simply a friend, a companion, someone to talk with.  I guess I just don't understand why some of the women he was servicing didn't try talking with their husbands about what was bothering them rather than letting this situation come to a head.  Of course, as infidelity is an ugly thing no matter how many screwball slapstick antics you apply to it like this movie did, it all comes crashing down on him when his mother rings up for some loving.  That's an urban ledgend if there ever was one.    I gave this only 2 stars because the happily ever after ending was too hoaky for words.  Still, it is a commentary on the world being full of lonely people 
 The story was slow, predictable and boring. I am still amazed I hung in there and finished reading it.  It's a dud in my opinion 
 This book started off slow with the formation of the Hawaiian islands and just continued from there.  The second chapter was more insightful and interesting but it seemed to drag.  Several pages could have been cut or edited out.  It would have been better if this book moved through the years a little more swiftly, than dragging to each persons life.  It was very difficult to finish and this is one book I will not re-read again.  It was about as interesting as a school text book, without a teacher to bring out the lesson 
 I see several previous reviews that acknowledge the fact that this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like "straw" yet say that is because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean!  Are you kidding me?  If having "clean" hair means having my hair feel like straw and it does literally feel like straw, then I'll happily return to having "dirty" hair...seriously, I've had smoother, softer hair from drugstore shampoos that cost .99 than this 20 dollar shampoo and conditioner!  I could not even run a comb through my hair while it was wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough! I have rather dry hair, and I merely tried this product on a lark, just to see if it was any good because I am a fan of Jonathan and his show, so I will return to my drugstore shampoo, Dove and Pantene which have always worked well for my dry hair.  
 Breath-taking! I have worked and traveled in  Russia  and the CIS over  the past ten years and I am reminded of the story of the two scientists who went to the seashore to discover what a beach was. The first scientist observed the waves and tides pounding the rocks and said, "Aha! Big rocks grind together to make smaller and smaller rocks until we get some pretty grains of sand!"   The second scientist went to the beach with a pair of tweezers and a magnifying glass, and spent all day selecting grains of sand according to his preference of shape, size, weight and color. Then he hauled his sand collection to his laboratory and began to categorize and cross-compare each grain of sand with the grains of sand from foreign country's  beaches until he felt he had enough data to write a book about how large Russian rocks preyed on small Russian rocks and how pretty pieces of Russian sand were rare; and that the pretty pieces were always buried in the mud of a Gulag and how all the rest of the sand grains had to hide the audacity to strive to be beautiful - which could somehow provoked the envy of the big rocks into oppressing the sand grains.   In the end, his book was full of clever sophistry and cynical blame for the majority of the Russian sand grains wanting to be beautiful. He concocted his own "Cosmic Law" which stated that Russian sand grains were either content to live in dreary, collective layers because they did not want to be envied by other Russian sand grains who were afraid of the bigger rocks -or that all Russian sand grains should strive to rise to the top where they could hide under new "Laws" which would protect them from learning responsibility and from thinking for themselves; thus keeping all the grains of sand under "soft" control and diverted from trying to be better sand-grain souls.  I hesitate to use a four letter word to describe the author's covertly angry, bitter and abusive criticism of the evolving and talented  Russian people who have, after several hundred years only just begun experiencing the decency of a leader from their very own country. (Even Stalin was Georgian), but so, for the opportunity for the discerning sociologist to experience and study a stunning and ingenious example of "Sophistry",  I shall give this book one star. The thundering silence of any encouraging word and the breathtaking jealousy of the re-emerging, responsible podvig of the Russian people will become self evident to students of ignorance versus spirited elan 
 The wireless connection on this mouse and keyboard is absolutely horrible.  With fresh batteries (changed several times) and having the pod close or far from the keyboard or mouse doesn't make any difference. The mouse is jittery and jumping right and left because of bad connection, even resetting it doesn't work.  The keyboard has the same problems, with a message popping up on the screen continually.   Avoid this product 
 This map is meant to be an accompaniment to the DK Eyewitness Travel Guide to Paris, and it may be that it works well in that role. (I enjoy the books; I think the series is terrific.) But as a standalone product, I found it an unsatisfactory compromise between the Streetwise series and a "real" Michelin city map. It is larger than the Streetwise series, and shows a bit more of the city, but it is seriously lacking in the detail that comes with the Michelin city map. And if you want to go anywhere beyond the central arrondissments, you're out of luck.  The good aspect of the map is that it is laminated and folds easily, but it's a little too big to carry in a jacket pocket. If you're just looking to guide yourself around the center of town, you're better off with the Streetwise guide, which is of a more convenient size. If you really need to find a particular street, and/or you want to explore beyond the tourist areas, stick with the big Michelin or equivalent. They may be clumsy to handle, but the big maps have the best detail.  PS: I agree with the other review regarding the Metro map. It lacks route numbers and it is awfully small 
 Another money making scheme dreamed up by the marketing department.  This is not how D&D is supposed to be played 
 Nothing. Not even a trailer. What a wasted opportunity for a commentary by West (who does do them -- he did one for When A Stranger Calls) or a retrospective featurette.  All you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between Cusack's character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger, footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie 
 I got about 40% through it, but couldn't make myself finish this one, since I just couldn't care about the protagonist. Grace Archer is a control freak. That causes her to make foolish decisions. She has trouble accepting help when she's in over her head. If she were family, you'd stick by her. If she's only a character in a book, you might just close the book and say, "Enough!" I did 
 There is no doubt that both of them are well-educated gentlemen. This destory the whole purpose of the book - they are too polite to have any confrontation. Throughout the whole book, they are just presenting each other their own views. They actually haven't met each other to have a discussion and in fact, the title of the book misled me. It should be called "Belief or Non-Belief: Some Correspondences 
 I was not expecting the book to be so sports oriented.  I guess I need to go back and look at the description.  I have only made if through the first few chapters and it is b-o-r-i-n-g!!!!  It is rare that I don't finish a book I start, but I think I'm done with this one 
 The characters in this book are forever taking showers.  When they're not taking showers, they are either planning to take a shower, wishing they could take a shower, or telling each other to take a shower.    Why in the world does she make the main character, Kate, a scant *29* years old??  It's ridiculous.  Not only does she have an MD, she has at least one PhD.  And she has managed to reach the top of her field by 29.  But wait, there's more!  She also, during all this achievement, managed to squeeze out a baby at the tender age of TWENTY, and then raise it.  Uh huh.  Why does Johansen not just make Kate 39, and be a bit more realistic on all counts?  There is a hint early on when Kate muses that Benny, her ex-husband's new girlfriend, is only 23, which makes her so much more attractive than elderly Kate.  ARGH! Clearly, Johansen does not think a woman can be attractive at the advanced age of 39.  *snore*  How ridiculous 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 Some of you guys must have some crummy soundcards installed on your machines if this widget sounds better than your stock unit.  In theory of course, the AA micro should be the business. It's a dedicated D/A or D/D unit as far as I can tell. But the transients are terribly produced - No solid sound stage, I'm also hearing added noise. And I'm not expecting audiophile quality either! I'm using a mid range pair of Sennheisers on my IBM X40 Thinkpad. Seriously, the installed sound card is quieter and does a far better job. I tried a variety of apps (musicmatch, mediaplayer, audition) with the same results. The noise is not constant, so must be in the conversion stages, instead of interference.  Wanted to love this - but it's rubbish 
 The fact that Mr. Churchill is a phoney should discredit anything he writes.  If Churchill identifies himself as non-indian, then, perhaps what he writes could be credible.  But to masquerade as something other than what he is, is so disingenuous that nothing he writes should or can be taken seriously 
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 I'm so sick of Rapist Kelly. First he records himself raping a 14 year old girl and every one of his songs is about sex. All of his songs have clues that makes him pratically tell on hismself on just how much he likes 14 year old girls. It can be in his lyrics. Sometimes, the song titles say it all. 1. "Your Body's Callin'" lyric : "your body's callin me" Yeah and that 14 year old Mommy's calling her. 2. "Bump N' Grind" lyric : "I don't see nothing wrong witta liitle Bump N' Grind" I saw the tape. I BET YOU DON'T. 3. "Homie Lover Friend" LYRIC : "Homieee lover friend is what I'm looking for, Some one who can relate to what I have in store" what you have in store can cost you a prision sentence 4. "It Seems Like You're Ready" : I doubt it. She was 14. You Probably forced her 5. "Freak Dat Body" Freak a body that can legally buy cigarrates. 6. "I Like The Crotch On You" BET YOU DID 7. "summer bunnies" Lyric : "It's summertime so it's time to get a summer bunny" Again, get one that can legally buy cigarattes 8. "For You" lyric : "You need a man who's (honest) and (understanding)" I bet his wife wasn't understand when she saw that tape. I bet he was dishonest and deined it to his wife too. I hope she turned him in 9. "Back To The Hood Of Things" are those 'things' 14 year old girls? 10. "Sadie" is that the 14 old girl's name? 11. "Sex me 1 and 2" he'll get sexed alot when they lock his A$$ UP. 12. "12 Inch Play" Is her refering to a vinyl record or the legnth of his magic stick? It's hard to tell because it saw so far inside that 14 year old girl I'm suprised he was able to take it out See, this is what disgusts me about Rapist Kelly. In every one of his songs, he either tells on himself, has a sexual reference, or has clues in them. All of his songs have double meaning to them now. Even songs that he writes for other musicians have clues in them : Examples : Aaliyah (RIP) "Age ain't nothin but a number" That is exactly what Rapist kelly was thinking when he was doin that 14 year old girl. He wrote Toni Braxton's "I don't want to". He's going to be saying that when some guy tries to rape him in jail and they probably won't take no for an answer. He also wrote Syleena Johnson's "I am your woman". Once he's raped in jail, he's going to be going around singing "I am your woman". Rapist kelly disgusts m 
 only 5 songs worth anything the rest is all noise.  2 of them are well knowns played millions of times, Walk Away, funk #49  The REAL burners on is this are, Laguna Salada, Country Fever, and the best song of all is "You're going to need me, Live"  oh man!  if your only going to buy one song, this is it!!    
 I bought this book with the intention of learning the JAI API for dealing with imagery.  I have read the book from cover to cover three times, and all I have learned is how wonderful a developer the author believes he is.  This book does not go into enough detail on any of the API's, but it is especially lacking with regards to JAI.  He has some sample code in the book, but all of the sample code is wrappers he has written around the Sun API's.  Instead of explaining the API's one would like to learn, we are given a full detailed explanation of the wrapper code he has written, and leaves the API explanation details to the reader to figure out for themselves.  This book is a complete waste of time, and has to be the worst book I have ever read relating to Java.  Next time, save your development skill advertising to your resume. 
 After watching the 1 Ultimate Avengers I was expecting a another action packed romp through the park, but I realized this was truly anti-climatic. The HULK make the 1st movie extremely appealing with his rip-roaring rampage while decimating everything. I expected to see even more of the HULK this time and pretty much got nothing. Yuk for the sidekicks (No offense all the other hero's are just sidekicks to the HULK) blah, blah. While the Black Panther was cooler than I thought he would be, This was boring. WHERE WAS THE HULK???? Marvel, can you please do an American Icon like the HULK some love and give him some air time? HULK MUST SMASH and I cheered when he did (finally) show up but sorry this movie was mostly lame. Well, I bought it and I am stuck with it. I am feinding for the HULK to take it somebody (Villan or Hero) and open up a can o whup- @zzz. Please Marvel enough with the Aliens, there are some really cook villians in the Marvel Universe (Really Cool) and I have been a fan of the Avengers for decades but as much as I like Indepence Day The Movie, this Avengers seemed more like a knock off. Do yourself a favor wait until it comes on Cartoon Network or something, this was truly mediocre. HULK SMASH!!!! 
 I bought this with high hopes, but the nauseating in between song banter had me reaching for the sick bag. i know there are only two reviewers who think this album stinks (me being one of them) but for me this album came across as the worst sort of bible belt music; a happy clappy, feel good sort of affair but totally failing to uplift. The songs are all over the place and inconsistent in quality. I found this record dull in the extreme, so tedious my eyes shut long before  each side had completed. A cure for insomnia. Sorry James, I know you suffered for your art as a young man, unfortunately as an older man its me doing the suffering. 
 "High Intensity" is the continuation of the lives first introduced in "High Energy". The simple fact that there is a continuation struck me as odd. I won't give away the ending of HE, but I could have swore their story was finished. As we discover in HI this simply isn't the case. Once again this book is a testimony that sex scenes do not make the romance. Everything about this story was absolutely ridiculous. I won't go into detail about the story because I am sure there are plenty of other reviews doing that. I will say, however, that this booked surpassed kooky and entered into the realm of silly. I got bored real quick with the antics of Zanita and Tyber by the 3rd chapter. The crazy thing is it got worse and I!!!! kept reading. I can only say that I was hoping for something better from one of my favorite authors. Considering this is the fourth sub-par performance from DJ, I am skeptical of buying any of her other books that DO NOT DEAL WITH THE MATRIX OF DESTINY. If I could give this book a 1/2 a star I would. It was that bad! If you are dying to read it for yourself. I would suggest taking a trip to the library and saving yourself a few bucks for something else more worth your time 
 To let you know where I am coming from, I am out of shape and fat. I wanted a primer to increase flexibility before starting into more serious exercise. I would have thought that a video which had both stretching and flexibility in the title would have systematically and progressively worked on each major group of muscles - this one doesn't. Session one has breathing instructions while session two doesn't. As a beginner, it helps to be reminded to breathe. Rodney Yee's videos seem to be better at involving the whole body and the exercises flow together 
 I have used this _RW with my Sanyo DVD recorder. The result is that I cound not play the recording. It wil freeze up. and some times they can not be formatted. They will not function well if they are used for the VR mode. I have used other brands such as TDK or Fuji. they are OK. 
 A music on this disc is very good and can be a good introduction into Tatum's world. It's also not too complicated. Bad news is quite poor sound quality. Good for listenign through PC speakers but decent Hi-Fi system reveals all recording's shortcomings and make it quite disapointing 
 Williamson does a great job describing the goddess and valuing our feminity. Readers will get that usual warm fuzzy feeling that Marianne is so good at evoking. In the dozen plus years since writing this book it seems that her own advice just doesn't cut it anymore than weekly psychotherapy sessions do for others. Perhaps the "imbalance of male/female energies" in the world is to blame. Williamson's lectures or "ministry" seem to reflect a segment of the female population that are highly intelligent, well-educated, articulate, charismatic, attractive, and a basket of neurotic therapy junkies. There is a distinction between maintaining well-being and indulging in self-help addiction at the expense of your life. Williamson's Woman's Worth appeals to an audience of modern women seeking solace or hiding their desire for an M.R.S. degree. Jean Shinoda Bolen's "Goddesses in Everywoman" is a real classic from the early 1990's. If you're looking to have Jungian archetypes on a feminine divine force empower you woman-ness ... pick up Bolen's books instead. For all Marianne's mantra of women power ... she still grips in her latest book about turning 50, having no man in her life, and the other usual complainsts since her lectures on metaphysics began in 1983 ... mainly about men leaving her for someone they love enough to marry. Williamson's "student of life" content, heavily borrowed from all sorts of Bay Area New Age "stuff", is great for anyone who wants to scratch the surface of spirituality rather than deepen into it. My humble advice: take-up Buddhism, see a real therapist, and listen to women who are living the life YOU want in different areas (love, career, health, etc).   As for metaphysics  ... better off reading grounded lessons from Lynn Robinson, Penney Pierce, Sonia Choquette, Cheryl Richardson, and Julia Cameron. No one has a perfect life, but do look at how they strive to live their life in daily actions (remember - we all make mistakes, at times quite foolish) ... and consider it in selecting an informal guide and wise woman 
 This camera takes virtually worthless pictures and the camera settings are very difficult to change/adjust.  The included instructions are a joke.  Save you money to buy something else 
 This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring. I will not read another one. I love murder/mystery books and this was not a page turner. The ending was very disappointing 
  Before you buy into the hype and purchase an item you'll eventually discard (if you love your dog, that is) you should know that dogs hate this device. It feels totally unnatural to them. Its so-called "scientific" design is based on the way a supposed alpha wolf enforces his authority by aggressively gripping a subordinate around the muzzle with his teeth. (Nice, huh?) Since we now know that the alpha theory is false, the rationale behind this torture device for dogs is equally bogus. (Wild wolf packs do not form dominance hierarchies or spend time trying to show each other who's boss by grabbing each other around the snout; such behaviors are only produced when wolves are forced to form unnatural packs while living in captivity.) A device that mimics a totally unnatural act of aggression cannot be considered positive.   As a dog trainer, and just as a human being who loves dogs and hates to see them being mistreated, I cannot stress strongly enough that this device should not be used on any dog, ever.   So what do you do to keep your dog from pulling? Dogs don't really pull on the leash so much as they get pulled on by things in the environment that stimulate and attract their instincts. So the trick to training a dog NOT to pull is to play games that will make YOU more interesting and more appealing to his instincts than the things in the environment are.  
 I think producer Mo Ramchandani should be commended for his integrity in honestly reviewing his own film.  This is rare in an industry that is proliferated with bald old men who are more interested in turning a profit than producing a good film.  This was by far the worst film i have ever seen, i urge anybody on this page not to waste their time.  Director Sean Mcginly should have been fired on the first day of shooting and replaced with anyone, even a farm animal, and then maybe the psycholgical complexities of suicide would have been better explored.  I look forward to more from producer Mo Ramchandani, its clear he's not going to make teh smae mistake twice!!!! 
 I bought one of these pepper mills at Cost Plus with the intent of replacing our current pepper mill which ground the pepper very finely and wasn't adjustable.  I am sorry to say it didn't live up to my expectations.  The courseness of the pepper was too my liking but the handles lacked the ridgidness I expected and always felt like they would break instead of just flex.    Another problem was the inconsistency with the amount of pepper that would come out with each squeeze.  Sometimes you would get an adequate amount and other times hardly any pepper at all.  This was the biggest drawback for me since I love pepper in my cooking and at the table.  My wife was even more unhappy with it and recently it disappearred so I am looking to buy another one 
 I love vampire/werewolf/paranormal stories as a rule, but just couldn't get through this one.  I thought it was annoyingly over-written.  The author spends so much time telling us what's going on inside Nick's head that the story itself suffers.  And the jumping back and forth in time is distracting.  I was only able to get through one-quarter of the book before I put it down.    The author obviously has talent, but this book could have used some serious editing.  
 John Dunning's "Booked to Die" was a New York Times best seller, and also won the prestigious Nero Wolfe Award.  It is one in his series of Denver police procedurals featuring homicide detective Cliff Janeway.  Dunning, who lives in Denver, Colorado,owned the Old Algonquin Bookstore in Denver for many years, and "Booked to Die," (duh!) is set in the world of rare and collectible books.  I really found it an interesting world to enter, and learned quite a bit about it before the book was done.  But do I believe the designated villain, a book dealer, really would have killed?  Not on your life.  And do I believe anyone would kill over some valuable books?  Not on your life.  Of course, I realize that in the current world, it must require great imagination to write a mystery that doesn't feature as villain a ruthless drug dealer with friends in high places; still, one of the first requirements of a mystery, for me at least, is at least temporary believability.  Dunning writes well, he does well by Denver, and, as previously noted, the book trade. He's a thorough-going professional, and the story keeps trucking along, rented U-Haul and all.  As, "I drove south, into the coming snowstorm.  I thought about the U-Haul truck and the mileage that Bobby Westfall had racked up.  I thought about Greenwald and the screwed-up Ballards and the turtle-faced man.  Snow began to crust around the edges of my windshield.  The road was getting slick."  Still, the book has a paint by numbers feel to me, or rather it has no feeling, to me.  Supporting characters are cut from the finest cardboard. I'd say the book didn't touch my emotions, but that wouldn't be entirely true.  It left me with a bad feeling.  Consider: the first love interest deserts Janeway without a word when he leaves the police force.  A woman who's met up with the book's actual designated bad guy in an unpleasant way is a total senseless irrational coward, keeping herself and everybody else in continuous jeopardy.  Suspicion is cast on the book's later love interest, a ploy that's been used untold times by writers better than Dunning.  And a 19-year old female character, introduced only to be killed shortly, is made a Glaswegian Scot, no less, and stuck with the given name of Elspeth Pride, known as"Pinky" by her friends. For heaven's sake, if you're giving a character only 30 pages to live, at least give her a humane name.  My yiddische grandmother, whom I loved, used to say of someone she disliked," he should live and be well."  After that came an unpoken sentence: "But not in my vicinity."  Dunning should write and be well, but not in my vicinity.    
 I am not too thrilled with this cookbook.  Many of the ingredients are not items that you would have readily available in your cabinets or refrigerator.  Also, it seems like the preparation and cooking of these recipes would definitely take more than 15 minutes 
 I don't know why this book is a classic.  Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother.  He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all.  He then takes their ways back home with him.  marries his cousin and gets everyone to wear clothes like the foreigners.  This is a nightmare, not a children's book 
 Regarding the intent of the American Idol competition, Simon Cowell has put it nicely and correctly on numerous occasions.  He constantly reminds, "This is a singing competition.  Not a dancing competition.  Not a beauty pageant.  Not an acting contest!"  Pretty correct if you ask me.  Along comes DREAM GIRLS and it seems high time that the Academy Awards heeded Cowell's astute advice in the reverse.  Someone at the Oscars needs to wake up and realize that the Academy Awards is not a singing competition.  Instead it's all about the acting and, arguably, DREAM GIRLS offers the definitive case in point.  To put it bluntly, Jennifer Hudson's acting performance was, for lack of a better description, hilarious.  The girl can't act and yet she toted away one of the preeminent Oscars of the year.  But don't take my word for it.  Virtually every serious movie critic, when considering DREAM GIRLS, noted what I have already stated.  They all agreed that Hudson's performance was amateurish at best and that she would, nonetheless, win because of her singing.  Think about it.  The movie was nominated for more awards than any other film and came away virtually empty-handed.  Now why is that?  Quite simply it's because the movie fell flat and considerably short of the movies that ultimately won.  Most honest critics, as well, were quick to note that, had things gone the way they should have, Eddie Murphy would have won and not Hudson.  Some have even been so bold as to note that Murphy's singing is nearly as good as Hudson's.  I heartily agree.  But, then, the Academy Awards continue their downhill slide toward being totally hilarious in their own right.  Anymore, movies seem to win more on the basis of PR and marketing campaigns than on actual merit.  And, as DREAM GIRLS and Hudson illustrate, sometimes it seems the Academy likes to promote a controversy as much as an actual success.  Watch this one if you want a good laugh.  Other than that don't waste the time or the money.  THE HORSEMAN 
 I read the book to find a new gems of wisdom from the prophet.  It became clear that the book is full of virtues that very few would quibble with.  However, you would think that a modern prophet would give at least one quote from the Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or Pearl of Great Price. But there is not a singe one.  Upon reading the book, everyone will see that we believe in the Bible, since it is quoted every few pages. The book stands for everything Christian that everyone will agree with, and stands for nothing that is uniquely Mormon.  No mention of the restoration of the gospel, Joseph Smith, eternal families, or any of our beliefs from the plan of salvation.  More and more, we seem to downplay who we are, a part of mainstreaming which all members should objectively admit is occurring.  
 Simon Winchester's journey up the Yangtze river is often poetic and overruns with historical detail every eddie of the way up the river. If anything, this is an incredible historical text of China. The author's research is impeccable and undeniable. However, every word of the way through this book I couldn't help but feel a profound disappointment in what could have been, but clearly is not, one of the the most epic journeys of our time. Mr. Winchester's timing was perfect, a trip up the Yangtze before the Three Gorges dam would change it forever and as the country is experiencing a rebirth that will soon make it the largest economic superpower in the world where it is destined to stay for the next century.  Yet with all his research, all the planning, and all the help he received along the way, we're left with only a few hundred pages of text. Where are the thousands of pictures? Where are the video clips of his journey? Where is the interactive website? He mentions in the opening pages that he packed a Leica M6 camera but, at least in the paperback edition, there is not a single picture in the book. From a man who successfully sued the Defense Department over the Freedom of Information Action in order to get the Pentagon's most detailed maps of the river, I expected more. Instead, we are left with a very long-winded account of the author's journey, but not a deserving account of China's journey 
 As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.  When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.  I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to.  I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.  I feel like I wasted money.  I feel robbed 
 The story of Inanna can only be described as wierd. Yes, we all know that the story is from the Middle East and comes from a time when literature was completely different from how it is today. Although it was fun to sing the songs of the characters within a group in a high school class, the story didn't strike me as a personal favorite. I believe that it is a story not particulary written for high school students as we sometimes get lost in the humorous hints of sexuality and the numerous accounts of repetition. However, the story does contain good story line about a character known as Inanna who is the goddess of love. It enlightens certain decisions that she must make in her journey that will make her a woman. From Enki, her father, giving her all of his "me" because he was so drunk to Inanna's journey in the underworld, the story is rather entertaining if you are attentive.  From my experience of the book, its not a story that I would pull out of a bookshelf and just begin to read. When laid in front of me as an example of a different writing style from the past, I took it what it was and made the most of it.      
 I'm a huge Bone fan and I expected a great DVD and it has many performances but the catch is that THEY LIP SING on all there performances.  So when they perform on stage they basically sound the same as our CD's we have of them.  The only performance that they actually rap in this DVD is the 1996 MTV Awards and you can clearly tell the difference.  But to Bone's credit that performance was hot because they actually did rap.  If it wasn't for that great performance this would've got 1 star.  And the backstage seens were short and worthless basically.  So even if your a huge Bone fan its not really worth it cause of the reasons mentioned... 
 I have long considered myself a Christian with moderate theological views, standing between the extremes of both right wing fundamentalism and liberalism.  So when I saw this book on the shelf I looked forward to reading it.  Unfortunately Bawer's idea of a "fundamentalist" is anyone to the right of the notorious Bishop Spong.  Time and again he employs the "either/or" fallacy: either one is an enlightened, left-wing, revisonist, touchy-feely, creed-hating "Christian" or a naive, dim-witted Bible thumper.  Nowhere in Bawer's prejudice is there any sign of the tolerance he lambasts others for lacking.  Nor is there any mention of believers such as Tony Campolo, Jim Wallis, Luke Timothy Johnson or Ron Sider, who stand in the center of many political and theological issues. According to Bawer such individuals simply don't exist.  In addition he makes numerous false statments.  A glaring example in on page 40, where he claims that the doctrine of the substitutionary atonement was invented by Augustine in the fifth century.  He ignores Jesus' own statements  throughout the four gospels on the meaning of his death.    In fact he shamelessly employs a pick and choose approach to Christ which ignores anything the Lord said that doesn't fit his politically correct conception of the Saviour.  The result is a Jesus that resembles Alan Alda far more than the character portrayed in Scripture.  I could go into detail about these weaknesses, but to do so would simply be a repetition of prior reviewers.  Suffice it to say that those looking for a balanced treatment of Christian fundamentalism should look elsewhere.    
 Bio-identical hormones are not all they are cracked up to be.  They have serious, dangerous impacts on the human body.  Please, if you are going to try these, do your homework first.  A growing number of women are experiencing lethal side effects.  Some don't make it out the other side.  I am one of the lucky ones - I survived the blood clots in my legs and two near-fatal, year-long illnesses connected with use of "natural" progesterone.  Since that time, I have been contacted by scores of women who have suffered due to use of these hormones.  I hope this information will be helpful to someone else, too.  Please, safeguard your health - no one else is going to do it for you 
 this book is not good.  It is the reason why men are so frustrated with much of the womyn's literature that is coming out.  If you hate men and like womyn and are a womyn...read this book.  If you are human and do not hate people...stay away...it is toxic.. 
 Moved into a new home. Wanted a brand new vacuum for my brand new carpets, decided to try a bagless model. This thing is a total waste of money. It has barely any suction whatsoever, especially when trying to use the hose, so for now after running this thing I have resorted to getting down on my hands and knees and raking my hand in a circular motion one square foot at a time across the carpets, to pick up lint and people hairs and fuzz from a brand new carpet that this thing just couldn't suck up. It's ridiculous,it's a brand new vacuum! I have never had to do this with any other vacuum. I had my husband make sure it was working right and it is, it just has a very weak suction. This thing is going back to the store and I am getting my money back and using it to buy a better vacuum. DON"T WASTE YOUR MONEY! Also, I have always vacuumed my bare floors instead of sweeping, and this thing is supposed to work on bare floors (well, they all pretty much do that job, but for some reason this has a bare floor setting, whoop de do!)it wont even pick up a little dust on my bathroom floor, nor can it suck up a cobweb! DON'T BUY 
 The phone seemed to work ok with SkypeOut calls.  However leave the phone unattended for a few mins and the phone times out, and will not receive SkypeIn calls. It did not have a reliable connection either.  I am using WPA-PSK, and the phone would often drop the connection. If your looking to receive incoming calls use a landline, or Vonage 
 I don't suppose you can expect anything else from a book by an art critic, but the prose in "Italian Painters" was at times childish and sneering and at others the most insufferable fustian.  Here's an example of BB getting off before one of Raphael's paintings: "In presence of young Sanzio's picture you feel a poignant thrill of transfiguring sensation, as if, on a morning early, the air cool and dustless, you suddenly found yourself in presence of a fairer world, where lovely people were taking part in a gracious ceremony, while beyond them stretched harmonious distances line on line to the horizon's edge."  The scary thing is I simply had to open the book at random to find such a quote.  This alone makes it not worth reading, but the most frustratingly awful part is that the book is NOT AT ALL INFORMATIVE.  It is simply too short to give adequate treatment to the painters involved.  Leonardo and Michelangelo get about 3 pages each, less than half of which devoted to their actual works, while lesser artists like Fra Bartolomeo and Domenico Venziano get about a paragraph.  He also frequently interrupts his sometimes singing praise, sometimes shrill disdain to hastily expound fragments of an at times crack-philosophy.  His reasoning for why "Space-Composition" inspires the highest religious sentiments is truly laughable.  But even still: instead of getting a feel and grasp for each painter we are more familiarized with BB's unarticulated judgements.  We know that Luca Signorelli's colors are "sometimes not what they should be" but we are provided no example even in the paltry appendix.  It is clear that BB feels and looks very deeply into his paintings, but this is about the only clarification this book provides 
 Standard Heinlein Disclaimer: Heinlein is a frequently-polarizing figure in American literature. The people who dislike his work (e.g., A. Panshin) seem to *really* dislike his work, and often for reasons that seem to me spurious. The people who like his work are in many cases blind or too forgiving of Heinlein's problems as a writer. I like Heinlein's work quite a bit, and find all but two of his novels consistently enjoyable, but I would not rate any but one or possibly two of his books as being the "best of the SF genre." They are for me, however, always enjoyable, and that is no small thing to find in an author.   And as you may have guessed, this is one of the two.  (The other is "Rocketship Galileo" which, in my opinion, only suffers from the mistakes of a person new to writing novels, and a hoary "Nazis on the Moon!" plotline that, to put it mildly, has not worn well with time.)  The story behind this book is, apparently, that Heinlein was ill as he was finishing it, and it was published without the traditional editing cycle that he usually employed.  Could be.  Frankly, it's hard for me to imagine editing making this novel more readable.  This is a relatively interesting idea (a man's brain transplanted into a woman's body), but as many others have pointed out, the execution is poor.  Frankly, there's not much story here at all, aside from a man exploring what it's like being in a woman's body.  But the exploration is by turns dull and absurd.  Man in woman's body has many sexual flings!  Man in woman's body poses nude for a painter!  Man in woman's body cooks dinner for widower husband!  Man in woman's body finds that piano lessons he took as a boy are now useless, but he can run secretarial equipment!  The thrills never stop.  There are any number of other irritating things about this book (personally, I find being forced to try to pronounce "Joan" as "Joanne" really irritating, but that's probably just me [If you want it pronounced "Joanne", spell it that way, Bob!]), but I'll let you read the other reviews.  The summation is, for this lover of Heinlein, who has read almost everything he wrote, I can't reread this novel.  And for me, folks, that's really saying something 
 This is one of my favorite romantic comedies.  It is funny, touching, and has some of my favorite actors in it.  And it doesn't only center around the main characters but has a great ensemble cast of very interesting people! 
 Anyone with educational experience knows that good teachers try to make lessons engaging and meaningful. All this program does (if your district uses it) is create more work for educators with no real support or help, just a lot of demands in time and paper work. If you don't or didn't share and get help from your colleges before this program shame on you! How did you get through your Collage of Education?  Anyone with business experience knows this is just a great example of marketing; it plays on the notion of helping and lets administrators look like they have a plan to the public. If your district administrators needed this program they should have resigned their positions. After a few years of experience you should not have to invest the kind of money and resources this program requires. Who is making the money?  Who gets the kick backs? Not the classroom teacher who works longer hours than paid for already. Don't fall for the hype; this is just the latest educational reform gimmick. Making someone rich? Mark Twain had it figured out when it came to school boards.  Look it up. 
 I was really looking forward to both the book and the movie. Unfortunately I think both are very much overrated. Character development is non-existent. We're supposed to believe that the haunted, passive, timid character Dave was an all-star shortstop in high school? The book had a great premise and good beginning, but went nowhere interesting. The handling of Dave's character relies on cliche and we never really get insight into the book's most intriguing character. 
 Al Franken is an individual who has been mediocre at everything, this book is his attempt to take on radio giant, rush limbaugh.  All I can say is; it is a good thing Mr Franken used Rush's name on the title, otherwise this book would have been like every other Franken project: an abject failure.  If you are easily entertained by shrill, and hysterical name calling this book is for you.  I found it sophmoric, and superficial, pretty much like Al 
 My first adventure in investigative journalism, I was immediately captivated by the beginning: cast of characters, general overviews, and the excitement that, based on the overview of how the book was to go, it was  worth reading. The material was well written in that Mr. Moldea went into  fine and captivating detail asto what the investigators were thinking, what  EVERYONE was thinking. I was a little suspicious of the passage where he  describes visiting with Sirhan Sirhan, and given the result of the  encounter, maybe made the author a little biased asto how his investigation  would lead to. The ending left me in a completely different place, where I  believe the author's evidence lead me to. His conclusions were not anything  I had agreed with. I feel he made the evidence ultimately fit the official  version of the tragic downfall of RFK that fateful June evening in 1968 
 This book was so full of a trying-to-hard Austen language that  it was very annoying.  I didn't get past the first chapter.  The development of Margaret seemed fake and not in a way Austen had her heading in her novel.  Margaret desired to travel, but nothing is said of this.  Something like this would not disappear in three years.  Authors shouldn't stray from the original author's intention 
 The Good Girl is a Horror of a film. It imagines itself as an ode to the everyman, trapped in a humdrum existence. What it becomes on film is an insulting example of Hollywood filmmaking at its worst. I use the word insulting because that is what I felt as I watched this movie. Aniston, Nelson, Gyllenhaal, all are trying so hard to be average that they seem on the verge of a "Forrest Gump" imitation.  Gyllenhaal and Aniston in particular seem to be doing a caricature of working folk. The way they slump around and furrow their brows as they trudge thru the tired dialog, it's as though each is fighting to understand what the other is saying.   The film itself is grey and dull. The other characters in the film flat and stereotypical (i.e. the coworker who invites her to bible study).   Overall this movie isn't worth the time or effort it took to transfer it to DVD. In another era it probably would have never made it to the screen. Oh how I miss that era..... 
 The content is full of valuable information on selling. But this Audio CD is not my favourite.   Ziglar speaks so rapidly and non-stop! I guess nobody speaks in this mannner.  I mean, if you want listeners to enjoy your speech, it is better to  speak in a more natural pace, occassionally there should be a pause.    Ziglar is rushing the scripts when you listen to this CD. Choking the brain of the listeners with no respite whatsoever! Slow down Slow down......... Ziglar!  Give me some space to absorb your message!   I wish I can listen to your CD comfortably, but I can't.  You Read the scripts in such a rapid manner that it does not help your listeners to relax and enjoy your works. Ziglar!   I am sorry, I have to give you 2 stars based on your unsatisfactory presentation in this CD 
 I'm a retired Drama Coach, now a Life Coach.  Always looking for new techniques with which to help my clients, I bought (and read) The Sedona Method.  It can be summed up in less than one page.  The "Method" is basic NLP -- very simple, basic NLP.   But the book goes on and on and on.  The author stirs a little philosophy in with a lot of rhetoric, primarily telling the reader what he/she is going to learn.  Over and over and over.  One long pep talk/sales pitch.  There is also a multitude of disclaimers that if the reader does not have success with the "Method," it is the fault of the reader rather than any failing on the part of the "Method."  Towards the end of the book, the chapter titles begin to sound enticing, as if the reader is actually going to be told how to create this wonderful life of perfection which has been promised for the last two days worth of reading.  But the author fails again, giving very weak little techniques, again couched in rhetoric.  I get the feeling this very naive author learned a little about NLP, took an incomplete in Philosophy 101, and decided to make a "Method" out of it.  He also seems to have some doubts about his capabilities, because there are very tired "testimonials" highlighted about every other page.  I'm returning my copy of the ridiculous book, but feel sorry for those who think they're actually learning something when, in reality, they're just brainwashed into thinking it's all going to happen like magic.  Let's get real.  Healing (financial, physical, emotional, or of any other kind) doesn't happen like magic.  Yes, truths can be simple.  Yes, NLP works.  No, this book doesn't give the reader enough real information to make things happen.    I managed to get in touch with three people who went all the way with The Sedona Method.  One attended a very pricey seminar.  The other two bought the entire audio course for two hundred and fifty dollars.  All three agree that they learned something.  Here's how to do it:  Get "in touch" with (feel)what you are feeling right now, and ask yourself the following . . . .  1.   Could you allow yourself to let this feeling go? 2.   Would you let it go? 3.   When?  If you answer "no," you need to keep working or try again later.  If you said "yes," well, just release it.  Picture it bursting like a bubble, or feel it leaving your body.   That's it.   There are some wonderful techniques out there that actually produce results.  Unfortunately, this isn't one of them.    
 MUST READ REVIEW: The Free Speech Haters (lefties) have deleted this review Twice.  Robert Reich, was Bill Clintons scariest appointment. His ideology, ergo his politics has been the of the most extreme left of any Bill Clinton's appointments. And some may argue that he some of the most extreme viewpoints of ANY high level appointment.   Robert Reich and his ilk were very happy when from the 1940's - 1980, radical lefties was setting the public agenda. All items were in play, courts were stacked and extremist's legislatures abdicated their law making ability to the courts. The executive branch simply turned a blind eye when radical lefties created a false impression that they were supporting the constitution when in fact they were and still are systematically undermining it. Left-Wing views that were on the fringe of the Democratic Party in the Sixties and Seventies are now center stage. These views, being forwarded by people like Reich, Dean, Kerry and Feingold, seem accepted as normal.   Left Wingers - control the media, academia, the sciences, think-tanks, and for most of the last century the executive, judicial and legislative branch. Republicans were demoralized, but the pendulum has finally begun to swing the other way. People are finally getting fed up with the extremist left who is arrogantly opposed to honest intellectual debate for they are fervently certain that they are correct in all matters. Their disdain for discourse and for anybody who challenges them is extant.  But the worst part is that radical lefties are uncivil to the extreme. They fill the public airwaves and bookstores with nastiness. Listen to Air America or watch a Michael Moore DVD. Read their editorials and you will find vicious vituperative attacks. Open a leftist political best-seller and you find more mean spirited screeds. Extremist lefties, RAD-COMS (Radical Communists) typically reduce political debate to nonsensical statements that seem to be making point but are nothing but vague and angry assertions, unsupported by facts.  But what we're now witnessing is something far more corrosive of civic life than normal political vitriol: It's viciousness directed toward anyone holding a view other than the prevailing elitist left-wing propaganda. Insults also calculated to belittle and ridicule entire groups or judged to be different are part of the divisive wedge that lefties like to play in hurting the cohesiveness of the nation.  The Conservative tradition values free speech and debate. No one should be deterred from speaking his or her mind for fear of offending some group. Lefties are opposed to this idea, the shouting down of Ann Coulter the attacks on Christians, etc, etc. Are all handiworks of the left. It is their mean-spirited trash talk that fills their protge's with this HATE and ANGER of anybody not like them.  I'm sorry Mr. Reich, I used to be one of these lefties, and I know the condescension with which I was taught to look at people on the right. The attacking of American Citizens rather than ideas, the smearing of whole segments of society for some perceived ills against our ideology. This is leftism at its base. Fear and Hate driven. No. Mr. Reich it will be a sad day when you and your type WIN America. People are waking up, they are realizing that the great Democratic Party of yesteryear has been hijacked by Radicals.   Your book speaks about morals but you never discuss where the morals come from. Conservative position comes from a bedrock of factual and historical facts. They are a clear-eyed view of where America is and where we need to go. Your left wing morals come from a modernist philosophy, blown by the wind and proven to be a disaster. You biggest moral imperative is to BLAME others but that is what happens when you are ideologically based rather than historically and fact based.  I could go on and on, but MR. Reich, I used to be on the left. But the divisiveness, hate, anger, name-calling, utter compliance with leadership, no dissention, no debate, and supreme arrogance drove me away. Once one is away and in the middle you look at the two competing political thoughts and it is scary, very scary to see what you once were.   Mr. Reich, I am not an automaton, and that is what you need to usher in your America. What the conservatives need, is open honest debate, free speech, and equal time. You have a fight on your hands, one that I am hoping for my children's sake that you lose.

 I was dazed and confused reading this book.   NOt only do you need to go out and BUY a whole new set of toys ( a doll that can go to the potty)  but you also need to lock you and your child in a bathroom all day and have him/her eat salty food in order to induce drinking.   Bribing a child to do something that should be normal and natural does not feel right to me either   I guess the whole thing sounds like brainwashing to me and I was very disapointed by the concept.  I found it quite barbaric.  Sorry Teri. 
 This band has had some interesting moments over the years, particularly their seminal release, "Up In It", which featured alt.punk classics like, "retarded."  THey made an MTV worthy breakthrough with "Gentleman" but after that their legacy just sort of trailed off... This album yearns to be a come back album, along the lines of "Gentleman" but it comes up short in every way.   The main plus to this album is the funky, groovy drum beats and guitar hooks, but they sound dry and uninspired compared to earlier whigs efforts. Also, the lyrics are grating and monotonous.... you'd think he'd find something else to sing about after all these years, right!? If you are a die hard fan, then of course you'll want this album for your colleciton, but if you're new to the whigs, start with Gentleman 
 As time goes by, I have less and less respect for anything Milton Friedman has to say.  We should all remember that Enron is the desired Republican result of Friedman's "Structured Finance" - what others would call Organized Crime-style bust-outs and other scams. And we should all remember that the freedom to choose among consumer goods is NOT something the Founders considered important enough to enshrine in the Bill of Rights.  It is also important to note, as does Barry Schwartz, in his "The Paradox of Choice", that "constantly being asked to make choices, even about the simplest things, forces us to 'invest time, energy, and no small amount of self-doubt, and dread.' There comes a point, he contends, at which choice becomes debilitating rather than liberating. Did I make the right choice? Can I ever make the right choice?"  We normally assume in America that more options ("easy fit" or "relaxed fit"?) will make us happier, but Schwartz shows the opposite is true, arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well-being.  Many of Friedman's "suggestions for reform" are GOP platform line-items that serve the hidden agenda of gutting America's national security interests. This is especially true of his "school voucher" program that will deprive America the Nation of millions of intelligent citizens of the Republic who are qualified to vote based on an understanding of national issues that goes beyond the superficial jingoism doled out at "voucher schools", which are, in reality, nothing more than the segregation academies of the Massive Resisters.  So, as globalization (i.e. transnational corporatism) subsumes democracy, it becomes clear that Friedman is more of an apologist for profiteers and criminals than a major economic thinker 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 I would like to cordially invite Dr. John Gray to visit and work in the public school system, of which many campuses are run exclusively by women. These women can be very matter-of-fact, get-down-to-business and get-the-job-done.  Those gals are there to work.  Some of them try to bond emotionally and some do not.  But they get their jobs done.  They often have to do things they don't "feel" like doing, but they do it and they do it darned well.    I think the best cross-gender communication, whether at work or socially, can be as follows;  1.  Listen as well as talk. 2.  Respect the other person's views. 3.  Don't try to make a psychological statement about another person's style, whether male or female. 4.  Don't hog the limelight. 5.  Respond with empathy. 6.  Park your ego outside the door.  In other words, practice GOOD MANNERS!  It works every time 
  I think my title says it all, but I'll add a few reasons why. Bad writing, unappealing characters with no characterization at all (actually, that's a bit of a feat - how did Woods manage that?)trite dialogue, idiotic plot. Need I say more? I guess I'm especially bitter because I was trapped on a five hour flight, had already seen the movie being shown and all I had to read was this book. I wanted to parachute out of the plane. I see that used copies of this book are available for one cent. Save your penny 
 This product is routine Yoga and is not something unique. It is exactly which you can find in other Yoga classes 
 I read it so long ago that I actually forgot why I was not so impressed and I already gave the book away to my grandkids so I actually can't peek at it again. I think I recall not caring for the pictures. The choice of animals  were not friendly or pleasant. I usually love Richard's books 
 The book starts off on an interesting story - the real life capture of Crassus' Roman legions.  As soon as they hit the desert, the book goes down hill fast.  The overall plot is the stock story of a confrontation between good and evil, with a hero who must learn his supernatural powers.   If the story isn't to be banal, the author has to bring the world and the characters to life, to make them so involving that reader finds them compelling and urgent, not just a rehash of a cliche.  Except for Quintus, most of the characters didn't interest me.   There isn't enough character development to engage my sympathies.   The allies that he meets up with are rather boring people, given to gnomic sayings.  Drapaudi postures rather than lives, and she and Quintus have no chemistry.  Norton and Shwartz have turned to Hindu myth and legend, the Mahabarrata, which ought to be a refreshing change.  Unfortunately, they don't use it very well.  Their allusions to it strike me as rather too elliptical for the presumed audience.   How many Americans or Europeans are truly familiar with the Mahabarrata?   I don't think that the authors can rely on a few words conjuring a lengthy episode for their readers.  It is a vast work, and the authors have not confined themselves to the parts that are more familiar to the West.   It is like listening in on a conversation between two old friends talking about a distant shared past; they may know what they mean, but bystanders who have no context or familiarity with the subjects of the conversation are baffled.  Further, the walk through the desert becomes incredibly boring.  In the first place, it is hard to believe that they decided to cross an uninhabited desert.   The Chinese, who presumably have already made this journey in the opposite direction, certainly didn't plan well; did the commander give no thought to how his troops were to be provisioned?  What is now known as the Silk Road has numerous towns, oases, etc.: it was a major trade route, for heavens sake!  Wouldn't that be the sensible path to travel?   This is rather like describing I-95, the Federal highway that runs across most of the East coast as a animal track through a desolate wilderness.  But having decided to cross Asia the hard way, the story is a monotonous account of the struggle to survive: food, water, exhaustion.  A skilled writer ought to be able to convey the miseries without endless repetition.   Of course it is part of their experience, but this is a novel, it is supposed to have a compelling narrative.   Blinking is certainly an important part of the human condition, but I really don't want to read a chronicle of eyeblinks.  There should be some point to telling this tale. I think that most readers already know that deserts tend to be hot, dry and barren.    A tedious trip for characters and readers alike 
 Marcus loves lists. Give him the slightest pretext, and he's off making a list about something. Sadly, most of these lists don't pertain to Dylan or to the song in question here.  Let me be clear: I'm a Dylan fan and have read several books about him. But this one is a complete waste of time. I suggest this: if you;re interested in it, go find a bookstore and spend 15 minutes reading it. If you are still interested, you'll probably like the rest of the book. But I'll predict you'll put it back on the shelf 
 Except for the song, Mother Mother, I didn't really care for the rest of the cd.  I bought it for Mother, Mother so I guess I got what I wanted.  I had hoped to like other songs as well, but, oh well 
 Nothing like a bunch of multi-millionaires telling the saps who buy their CDs what a sorry state the nation is in. There are a few promising tunes on the CD but it's mostly the usual bilge being spewed by today's wannabe-activist musical acts. Save your money and download the songs you like from iTunes. As for Moveon.org -- their relevance has come and gone. Most of the kids buying this CD probably don't even know the original purpose of this passe, discredited organization. In summary, this is true bleeding heart feel good junk. Shut up and sing 
 "A Walk to Remember, is my favorite book.  I have read it at least three times.  You have all kinds of emotions when you read this book.  First you will smile, then you will find yourself crying.  It almost takes your breath away when you read about the love these two young people share.  Has you read this story, Nicholas Sparks makes you feel like you have know this couple all there lives. I highly recommed this book to anyone that loves romance.  And that believes in fate.  
 Let me start by saying I had no less than 4 books I consulted on a regular basis during my pregnancy and my favorite was the week to week guide.  This book was a huge disappointment. Not only do the weeks not always correspond to the age of the child (weeks vs. months), but I  found that a lot of the milestones were a little ambitious as well.  The book also comes across as very judgemental (baby swings are known as neglect-o-matics & cosutmes can scare a baby so keep him home on halloween) and gives you things to worry about without telling you why (to soothe a baby you can swing them, but don't bounce!).  I think the book should offer advice and then it's up to me to figure out what to do.  At first I thought it was just me being post-partum and sensitive but my baby is 13 weeks old now and I can see, the book is just not helpful.  Buy "What to Expect the First Year".  It gives enough information without making you worry about every little thing and gives you enough information to make an informed desicion without telling you what to do 
 I loved it the first 2 months i had it.  With out notice the cable shredded.  I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me.  It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it.  The customer service is bad and so was the product 
 Once "Let's Get Free" came out, it lauched a revolutionary group that was powerful in their lyrics and made you feel their whole message.  After damn near burning another whole in this disk, I picked up their mixtape.  It was alright but I was waiting for that 2nd full length album continuing from the debut album.  I bought this on the 1st day it was released and was highly disappointed.  Most of the beats sound the same.  The album length is entirely TOO short.  I would have given this 3 stars because the album content is not awful.  But Dead Prez loses a lot of credibility when on the SAME ALBUM you say "turn off the radio" and 5 tracks later you collaberate on a song with Mr. Radio himself, Jay-Z.  That loses a star right there.  Was this an attempt to appeal to the very radio stations that you constantly blast for not playing real hip-hop?  Well, I live in the major city of Philadelphia and I haven't heard about this song burning up the airwaves nor did I hear about it topping the Billboard music charts.  Great job, guys 
   DIS GY IS DA KYING OF DA SOUTH!!!   Give me a f***ing break. When are we going to stop seeing crappy rapper after even crappier rappers that are so full of themselves that they feel the need to plasture their faces all over every one of their crappy unintelligent so called albums!! Nothing descent to say at all, just a bunch of mindless [...]. I bet you they don't even like music, they just want to be a "celebrity"  and be rich for 3 years(till their broke). If they really did geniunly like music, it wouldn't sound that sh**y!!!! GET OVER YOURSELVES!!!  
 I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now 
 One or two errors in  book are not a disaster, but this book has far too many. It's difficult to accept any of the narrative as being true, because of the many blatant fact errors pointed out by other reviewers (which do not have to be rehashed again in this review). The portion about Lennon and McCartney's youth, for example, seems to be made up out of whole cloth. Like the rest of the book, it lacks any basis upon which the reader feels assured that he or she is reading what really happened, rather than some fanciful assumptions that arose strictly from the author's own imagination. Peter Brown's "The Love You Make," for all its faults and gossipiness, is a much more enjoyable read because it at least has the credibility of being told by a semi-insider. Spitz's book strikes out all around, because it does not even have this perspective, at the least, to lend it some credibility. 
 I have used this ice cream maker 4 times and on the 4th time the metal pin that turns the paddle broke. I find that the metal pin only goes into the plastic paddle about 3 inches.  The ice cream froze on the sides of the bucket and the plastic paddle couldn't turn the frozen  cream causing the paddle to crumble.  I would not recommend this to any  one as it is cheaply made 
 What is up with this new Soft = Loud thing? Kind of dull... It's like Lillith Faire for men.  ? I guess... They look mad cool though.  All brown and like Greg Allman circa '72.  Sweet brah... Well...you work hard all your life and then you have to do something...at least they're not killing anyone... Awesome.  
 Since I loved Jurassic Park and The Andromeda Strain (way back in high school) I happily picked up Congo at the airport. What an enormous disappointment - the book has the feel of having been written in an hour and a half. Nonsensical details are never explained (what's with the gray gorillas and the paddles? The gorillas were trained by the Zing-ites, back in the day, to execute people with the paddles and they sort of got into it? This is never made clear), the dramatic arc is entirely hosed up, and the characters are ridiculously one-dimensional. This is one of these books where you get to the last 30 pages and you realize that you're SOL - the plot is not going to come together, and you're not going to be satisfied. That, plus the obsessive detail about boring 1980 technology, left me entirely cold - this book hit the airport trash can the minute I debarked 
 I have ever listen to Final Fantasy 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10 original sound tracks.  I found this CD was really trash in a few second. Because all the tracks on this CD were inferior to original ones in quality.  Never buy this! 
 I've seen this movie. Even with Tom Hanks, Jon Lovitz and Geena Davis staring in it. I just couldn't enjoyed it. I found that both Madonna's character and Rosie O'Donnell's character were just flat awful. It took away from the movie, itself. 
 I've been waiting for this release, as I really liked her first two releases - but am glad I borrowed it first.  I tried to give it a chance but didn't really care for most of the songs - a major change from her first two cd's - too commercial - should sell well with the pre-teen market - those who's parents don't screen the lyrics firs 
 Silone's communist message is outdated. More, he makes the cardinal error to believe that solidarity is a basic human characteristic: 'Bread is made of many grains of corn, wine is made of many grapes, so it means unity. Unity of similar, equal, useful things. Hence truth and fraternity are also things that go well together.' But, man shows only solidarity if there is a 'personal' gain. Pure altruism is absolutely no option in the struggle for survival.  His picture of mankind is static, too rosy and naive. His belief in the proletariat is obsessive: 'the poor are uncontaminated by greed for property.' Hence, he proposes the abolishing of private ownership of land. 'Evil is only everything that prevents millions of people from becoming human.' For Silone, evil is not a basic and intrinsic part of the human character. He doesn't understand that all proletarians want their children to become (not static) doctors, engineers, lawyers, economists ..., in other words 'bourgeois'. In Stalin's Soviet Union, he sees only a fraternity of peasants and workers. The political role of the Catholic Church nowadays is marginalized. In Italy, they even don't have a Christian Party anymore.  Of course, the main character poses certain questions: had that (communist) community not itself become a synagogue? abandoned the critical spirit? the risks of conspirational struggles? His answer is no. He refutes that the communists aspire too to totalitarian power and orthodoxy and that a black inquisition will be followed by a red one. His return to his homeland 'had been basically an attempt to escape that professionalism', and he has the 'hope of one day playing a big role'.  Like a fanatically convinced Christian missionary, he tries desperately to sell his communist gospel to the poor cafoni. Unfortunately, they are terribly conservative ('it has always been so') and his message falls on deaf ears.  What is left in this book are the struggles against a totalitarian (here fascist) regime and against the butchery of war. It is partly very melodramatic (e.g. the confession at the end) and its main symbolism (a marxist apostle disguised as a priest) irrealistic.  I prefer Silone's more direct and less apostolical 'Fontamara' and recommend highly his masterpiece 'Emergency Exit' 
 Another movie using actresses seemingly straight out of soft porn. It's fun to watch them die onscreen sure, but it's redundant. I'm not surprised to read it's by the Shark Attack people. They're terrible too, but of course if they make a #4, I will rent it knowing it will be stupid. <sigh&gt 
 In an attempt to increase the range on my Netgear MR 314 router, I got this WG602 access point but I could not get it to function.  I was told I needed two of them, so I got a second one and I still could not make it work.  I gave up and replace my router with a RangeMax WPN 824 and it is terrific.  Gives me all the range I could want, letting me send and receive at 24 Mbs where the MR 314 would not reach at all. 
 Why in the world would I pay 40 bucks for a cd with oly 5 tracks, let alone 4 of those tracks can be found on your other cd's.(And make a real Xmas cd next). And those of you who bought it and complaint afterward, well you're an IDIOT.  I still love you Enya.  
 Don't waste your time on this thing until they fix the bugs. We bought the Bratz one & it thought it was a Pawz when we took it online. After 10 or so total hours (Yes, I know what I'm doing) fighting it I gave up & took it back. Tech support is a joke. There's NOTHING in the manual or online help, only a link to tech support who sends the exact same auto response every time, and none of those responses addresses the issue. 
 Honestly, I like Tony Brown. I enjoyed his PBS show. I listen to him on the radio when I can (WLS in Chicago). But, his books are not nearly as good as I know they can be!  This book deals with his "Mama", a woman who took him in when he was a baby and his mother was neglecting him. She was not a blood relative, just a woman who saw a baby starving to death due to neglect. He lived with her until her death when he was 12. This book is an attempt on his part to honor her and the simple wisdom she taught him. The Seven Core Values are:  1. Reality: The Value of Being Yourself. 2. Knowledge: The Value of understanding your purpose 3. Race: The Value of honoring your humanity (In this case, the only race his Mama was worried about was worried about was the human race) 4. History: The value of investing in the future 5. Truth: the value of being true to yourself 6. Patience: the value of "Keeping the faith" 7. Love: the value of living joyfully.  As in his other book, Brown repeats himself a lot. He quotes a passage from Hamlet 3 times (part of the "to thine ownself be true" speech) as part of his multiple descriptions of his high school English teacher. He lifts two pages from his other book concerning a story about a YMCA opening in his hometown. He says the same thing, over and over, repitiously, a lot. He repeats himself. Yes, indeed, he seems to say something and then say it again. Repititive, he is.  Like his last book ('Black Lies, White Lies), this book is in serious need of an editor. He seems to have written the chapters seperately, without regard to what he had previously written. I like the sentiments and ideas expressed, but, man, it was sometimes tiring to read them.  
 I have all but 2 books of this series (but not necessarily in chronological order), and at this point, I'm coming to the realization that after awhile, an author has said all there is to be said with a certain character/scenario.  How many times can Eve Dallas be personally targeted? How many victims remind her of her own troubled past? How many times can Roarke save the day? How many times can they have passionant sex that's a metaphor for how much she cares for him but is unable to express in words? After awhile, it seems like everything in Eve Dallas' life is a drama of Soap Opera proportions!   Like most hard-boiled type detectives, the action and adventure is non-stop and you never get the feeling that Eve gets to rest. After awhile, I find myself exhausted FOR the heroine and eventually I lose sympathy and interest. After all, who can identify with someone who is always strong enough to deal with anything that's pitched to her?   When the plot is intriguing, I don't mind the constant drama so much. I've enjoyed many of the other books, particularly Portrait in Death and Rapture in Death. But by this point, the clichs are getting really old, and I wonder if it isn't time for Ms. Robb to start a new series 
 I agree with the first reviewer of this book, this is not hoodoo! The author seems to have created a perfectly silly follow up to her first book. I would say that it's probably wise to avoid most llewyllyn publications all together, they are sad attempts by new age authors to mass market nonsense to eager readers....stick with Hyatt, Yronwode, and Haskin 
 This book read like a cheezy, mystery version of Rubyfruit Jungle--set on the border, Chicana style. It is overflowing with stereotype and is in need of serious editing. Despite its length, I read it in 2 days (for me not always a good sign) and was slightly shocked at how disappointed I felt because I have been a fan of Gaspar de Alba's thoughtful, theoretical work. I wonder what, if anything, this perfectly-resolved tale will do to shed light on the murdered women of Juarez, other than to detail the horror of the killings, which her readers are likely to already know. 
 Cons:  Defect: the backlight does not work.  Shortcoming: has Palm OS 3.1, an early version for Handspring Visors. Neutral:  (expedited) Shipping time: 5 days Pros:  Price  PS: Vendor customer support contacted me and provided a replacement unit with a working backlight, free of additional charge :) 
 Not his best book,I Thought Waldo Lost in New York is more authoritive. I mean who honestly belives that someone who is always lost can be trusted to help other people become self reliant, when he can't even rely on himself 
 Someone should ask the author how much more successful the UN would be in it's role if the US and Israel weren't always vetoing it's resolutions to act. If the single most powerful nation on earth and it's little buddy completely ignore the UN, veto it's every attempt to act, and directly undermine it's authority in the world for 50 years, who's fault is it that the UN is unsuccessful? I firmly believe the US has a moral and ethical obligation to lead the world, and I firmly believe we can do it morally and ethically. However, writing history in such a way that the sins of the US and Israel aren't there won't make that happen. We need to know what once was in order to know what now is, and we need to know what now is in order to lead a better world 
 i just failed to finish it. i rejected it from my dvd player after tormented by this horrible taste movie about 30 minutes. it's not just ridiculous or not funny, it's stupid. 
 The book lacks both technical details and inspirations. Contains several basic boreing projects so meticulously drawn line after line as for to be copied. The "trompe l'oeil" title is too ambitious either. Sorry to admit but very like other books offered 
 Other reviewers of this book have suggested one should not review a book without reading the whole thing.  I love reading, but was unable to finish this one.  The title and cover actually do give reasonable warning about the contents. The title apparently refers to folk wisdom from the continent with the highest child mortality rate in the world - obviously the best place to emulate!  Below the title is a picture of children the author may hope you believe are African, but they do not look like typical Africans to me.  The front inside flap lists her professed qualifications, including the amazing fact that she had parents!  That part of the book that I was able to read continued in this pseudo-scientific vein.  There are interesting ideas, fragments of apparently rational analysis, all embedded in a matrix of platitudes.  Someone who aspires to be President must have an understanding of the potential negative aspects of a proposal, not just the hoped-for positives, and somehow they never make it into this book.  She's obviously a smart lady, quite capable of incisive thinking.  Whether such thinking was left out of this book deliberately, or whether her background did not exercise her ability to see more than one side to a situation, I don't know 
 This book did NOT provide any good information for real business people trying to get money for their business.  Save your money by NOT buying this 
 When I picked up this "new release" up in '74, I couldn't have been a bigger fan of Mountain. Imagine my excitement as I stared at the album cover, with it's promise of big, big things ... Leslie flailing away on his axe, Felix at his side, Corky no doubt pounding away in the background. It couldn't miss! Imagine, then, my dismay and confusion as I plowed through track after track.  All the elements were there, but the magic was missing. Huh? Time gives one perspective. We all know that Mountain went through the familiar arc of rock band rise/success/burnout, with its requisite chemical abuse, ego imbalances, legal/contract hassles, touring fatigue, and general ennui after riding too high for an extended period of time. This band was no exception. AVALANCHE documents a band in the beginning of a death spiral. Sure, there would be more "product" from them under this moniker, with or without any of the original members. But that delicate balance of savagery and poetry that was Leslie and Felix' relationship had soured. After Climbing the Mountain, they tasted too much of the Flowers of Evil ... the Nantucket Sleighride was over 
 I truly wanted to like this book but found it completely self-indulgent and just boring. Navarro tries so hard to come of as an intellectual and really just comes off as a loser with too much time on his hands. I had to force myself to finish it - I'm glad I bought it from bookcloseouts 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 Well, it's a true story of one particular international relationship/marriage, and those are always helpful if you want to get a picture of what it's like. However, the book is not very detailed and poorly written. It will help in the process of educating oneself on the subject, but you will definitely need to read other books 
 The author has her heart in the right place.  She even starts out trying to go step-by-step, but it does not last.  Somewhere into the 3rd or 4th page she starts utilizing advanced jargon to explain her elementary concepts.  She never makes any reference to the 'advanced jargon' before this.  That means that she does not build brick-by-brick.    Also, her references to various charts is confusing and mixed up.  In one chapter where she introduces charting a stock on the monthly, weekly and quarterly charts, she makes conflicting points and ...well...let me not waste more time.  Her language use is not good, therefore, her communication methods leave a person hanging.   Just DO NOT buy this book.  There are other better books out there.  Such as Toni Turner's books.  However, let me just say that she does explain some other overlying economic concepts and global mechanics of wealth building warriors, sitting around the world, very well 
 The other reviewers here that reference their 13 year olds enjoying this book are absolutely right. This book is for 13 year olds. As a 25 year old trying to wrap his mind around programming, it leaves much to be desired.   If all you want is a gloss-over for someone who has no intention to continue in the field of programming, but just wants a non-programmers understanding of programming, this book is for you. If you want something you can take with you on a journey into real programming, you will have to really dig deep to distill the few morsels of theory offered here. In fact I had to reread most paragraphs dozens of times in order to find the underlying concept he was trying to teach; to find something that would still be useful to me after finishing the book.  Bottomline: A waste of time if you are out of high school and attempting to truly learn something about programming. Take a few minutes to skim thru the pictures at your local bookstore, then go buy a real programming book 
 The joke here is that Krugman is convinced he can write.  He ends his little intro with the smug assertion that "maybe economists can write after all," offering himself as proof.  (Krugman cannot write well, but he has mastered the clumsy, undistinguished style of a bad lit professor---the kind of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing---an accomplishment he's very proud of.  To use his own favorite "emphasizing" gimmick: Krugman stinks---full stop.)  The punchline is that shortly afterward, The New York Times hired him.  It was a match made in middlebrow heaven.  (I should add that I do like the substance of Krugman's newspaper articles, if not the style.  An enemy of the current White House is a friend of mine.)  As far as the economics go, he's pro-NAFTA and pro-"free trade" just like all establishment economists, and completely unwilling to critique the real forces at work in international markets.  Don't waste your time 
 Don't pay Amazon $34 for this subscription when you can get it directly from National Geographic for $15 
 After reading the reviews and synopsis here on Amazon (which is the same as on the back of the DVD), I thought that this looked like it would be a very good movie with a promising plot.  Within the first fifteen minutes, however, it was not at all as I expected.  First, the summary stated that Anna Manni (a police investigator played by Asia Argento, daughter of the director and one of the only redeeming features of this movie) was hot on the trail of a serial killer/rapist and would be captured because of an attack of the Stendhal Syndrome.  This is misleading because this actually happens early on in the movie (before any of her tracking him down is shown).  In other words, if you are expecting to see a movie about a beautiful, strong-willed police detective that is trying to capture a serial killer, this is NOT the movie for you.  Instead it is [mostly] a journey into the mind of a greatly disturbed (possibly psychotic) rape victim.  The overall quality of this movie is also not nearly as great as it's director's reputation.  This is my first Dario Argento movie, and it is a grave disappointment.  After hearing of the "Argento Genius," I really expected a movie with great editing, dialogue and at least a decent horror movie style soundtrack.  This movie instead is the opposite on all counts.  Finally, the style presented leaves a lot to be desired.  It is basically a mashing together of sci-fi, horror, drama, and even romance that doesn't quite work (some parts are so outlandish I could not help but laugh).  In short, save your money for a worthier movie that does not follow a flawed script to begin with, and that is not an attempt at such "stylistic" filmmaking. 
 This is at least one book too many for Peter.  Most of the stories are old and too many involve farts.  If you find this funny, your sense of humor has not developed since the second grade.  The book is full of errors.  Peter tells how Riviera is one of his favorite courses and then tells about his hole-in-one on the 15th hole. Sorry, Peter but the 15th hole is a par four.  You made your ace on the 14th hole.  It is evident that Peter not only did not write the book, he didn't even read it.     
 This book is very difficult to understand even with a basic background in finance and economics.  There is no structure, no clear definitions or definitions at all. I do not understand why the majority of instructors chose this text.  There even are errors in the solutions for the practice questions.  
 I bought this after reading reviews on the oxo travel mug.  Many said it kept things very warm for a long period of time.  My experience is to the contrary.  I've sealed the lid as tightly as I can, and I may get a decently warm drink for 30 minutes or so...The only accurate information I did get is that it doesnt spill!!!  Hope this helps 
 SEE THE BOOK BLOOD ON THE ALTAR FOR REASONS TO AVOID 
 I saw it on TV and LOVE that movie. I was so thrilled to get DVD to watch it again BUT the negative thing is there is NO CLOSED CAPTIONED or SUBTITLE for Deaf, Hearing Impaire and Hard of Hearing people. Its too sad. It isnt worth it to buy it. 
 I really feel stupid about ordering this book. Why did i do it?. The story is that Stacey is moving Back to New york 
 The information is not organized in a user-friendly manner.  I bought this guide and the Lonely Planet, and basically did not use the Rough Guide because it's not differentiated by category 
 Great cover, enticing premise. I couldn't wait to read this book...BUT... Every one-star review before mine lays my feelings out perfectly. Let me add a couple more. Frannie grows up, decides to live with a man and writes home to tell her mother what she's going to do. What does her mother say? That's nice, dear. I trust you to make the right decision. Oh please!!! This is the 19th century after all! Then for good measure let's throw this one into the mix. After the indomitable Una shows understanding and makes decisions that earn her the admiration and accolades of every living person, famous or not, that she comes into contact with...she decides to buy into an oil well to help a friend even though everyone agrees that this is throwing money down the rat hole. An oil well! You must be kidding! Of course, she eventually recoups her money plus a bunch.  I could go on and on. I finished every page of this book although I must say I skimmed through the last 100 pages. When I finished and my husband asked how it was, the only way I could think to describe it was SILLY 
 I have waited almost two months and the book still hasnt been shipped. I am still waiting for it to arrive. I hope this book is worth waiting for... 
 I bought this book many years ago and read it through. I was quite disappointed by the treatment of textual criticism given. The book reads like an advertisement for the critical texts that they have put out. It did not provide solid scholarly arguments to support their choice of manuscripts and methodology in making their textual evaluations. Many papyri are listed and classified according to their accuracy but no explanation or justification for the supposed authority of these texts are supplied - apparantly you're just supposed to believe the Alands and not question it any further. This book left me the impression that modern critical textual scholarship is an arbitrary and subjective endeavor lacking firm, testable scientific premises and is driven rather by personal preference and prejudice 
 I bought this on Amazons recomendation & can't stand it. I wanted neuvo Flaminco & this sounnds like Moog synthecizer elevator music I like the earlier work of this Atrist, the neuvo Flaminco.. & of course once you open the package its too  late to return it... so I'm stuck with their recomendation 
 This gun sucks! -it has the worst range out of all the ones I own. When I lob it, I can only shoot twenty feet. -fps sucks. i can shoot my hand two inches from the barrel and it doesn't hurt. -flimsy. no joke, I dropped it when I was playing, and it shattered. -accuracy is a joke. I have a walled backyard, and I was at one end. When I lobbed it, I hit the the wall once (20 ft away.) I fired it again (twice) and I hit 5 and 7 ft away from my mark. -The one "good" thing about this gun is the price. 3 dollars is not bad for this piece of dog feces 
 I only read to p.122, but since there are no negative reviews ...I just did not think Caputo was successful in bringing his characters to life, and thus realizing the potential of his concept.  I stopped reading soon after encountering Nordstrom, a self consciously aspiring Nietzschean "superman".  Yes, I have read and enjoyed Conrad; and Graham Greene 
 Wilkinson used a simple but effective teaching aid - 3 chairs which are used to represent 3 portraits or spiritual states in which everyone in the world can be divided into as illustrated in the diagram below:  CHAIR ONE - commitment, saved, spiritual	       CHAIR TWO - compromise, saved, carnal 	                 CHAIR THREE - conflict, unsaved, natural  His thesis that by identifying which chair we are sitting on at present, we can make a `spiritual breakthoughs' by making a decision to move from one chair to another.   Firstly, in an effort to make the concept relevant, Wilkinson have oversimplified the process of spiritual growth without reference to grace, spiritual formation, character development and development of new worldview. He seems to give the impression that spiritual breakthroughs is easy and achievable by human effort alone.  Secondly, there is weak theological support for his thesis except using Paul's terms (spiritual, carnal and natural man). In his Biblical example, he used Joshua, elders and children of elders. While he made his point of generational slide, the children of elders were disobedient rather than non believers. But it is true that there is a generational slide if each generation do not develop personal faith in Jesus.  Thirdly, Wilkinson meant the three chairs for Christians, backslidden Christians and non-Christian but there is no reference to the work of Jesus Christ on the cross and of the Holy Spirit in spiritual transformation. Wilkinson seems to imply that spiritual growth can take place by decision making alone.  There cannot be movements between the chairs without adequate appropriation of the theology of the cross and inner transformation without the work of the Holy Spirit especially in his examples of Julia, Ernie and Kate.  Finally, while marriage and parenting is important, one wonders whether the three-chairs model is the right approach. Section 3 & 4 sounds like promotions for Walk-Thru-the Bible Ministries programs. Wilkinson's book promises spiritual breakthroughs but one wonders whether it can delivers except for a short time haze of spiritual high.  
 Wolfe hero worships the Irish, and all others rank below them.  The Irish detective Martin, DAs Fitzgibbon and Caughey can do no wrong. The Italians, Jews and Wasps have their good points, but are flawed in one way or another. At the bottom are the "dark people" as Wolfe constantly calls them, who have created a great, dark hole in our once-great society. There is the single exception that proves the rule of the black public defender, though the narrative implies that his legal skills are inferior.  Granted it's an entertaining read, but don't be fooled 
 There are many good things to say about Mr. McWhorter's book. Manty other reviewers have done that.  I want to add a warning.  Mr. McWhorter's book is about the theory of language dynamics.  It is not about any particular language, culture, people, place, or time.  Mr. McWhorter explains the processes that cause languages to change over time.  He does a remarkably good job of this.  However, he makes references to actual languages and actual statements only as they serve to illustrate changes over time.  If you are looking for some understanding of some particular language at some particular time, you will sadly agree with me that this book constantly changes the topic.  If there is a sustained discussion of one language for more than ten pages, then I cannot find it.  I must admit that I could not finish the book, after several tries.  The subtitle should be removed from the book.  This book is not a history of languages.  It is an excellent exposition for the general reader of the dynamic forces behind language change.  However, it contains nothing about any particular language 
 Originally published in 1952, The Courage to Be by Paul Tillich is a compilation of the Terry Lectures delivered by the author in the same year. Tillich is a well known mid-twentieth century German-American liberal theologian. The following comments pertain to the 2000 re-release by Yale University Press  The lectures discuss the issue of courage and, are largely a response to some of the bleak existentialist philosophy prevalent at the time. I found the aspects of the text discussing existentialism to be the most interesting.  To the appropriate liberal academic audience in the early 1950's these lectures might have sounded majestic.  Tillich weaves a broad story touching on a range of philosophical, political, historic and scientific themes.  Fifty years later it feels dated and superficial; some of the themes e.g. existentialism, Freudism and Marxism are now somewhat passé and may be of limited interest to many modern readers.  This is not to say that the work is without value, I find that Tillich is always effective at conveying the majesty of God. Tillich was by all accounts a capable intellect, however, his ability as a communicator is limited; his use of language while occasionally poetic is often wordy and vacuous, while his argumentation can be sublime, it is frequently speculative and specious.  The Courage to Be is probably only of interest to Tillich fans.   
 I found the book annoying.  Why? Because St. James recommends too many times that if you can't "delegate" to someone else Christmas chores associated with upholding certain Christmas traditions, just don't do them.  Lots of contradictions in this book, too.  In the chapter "Remember What You Once Loved About the Holidays," she recalls "The fresh scent of pine when we first brought the Christmas tree into the house."  Later on she devotes an entire chapter to "Twelve Reasons to Skip the Tree."  And then there is the irony of paying money for a book that tells you to cut way back on your Christmas spending. There are a few good tips among the 100 ways St. James offers to "Simplify your Christmas," but they aren't worth the price of this book.  The bottom line is that, for adults, "keeping Christmas" involves a certain amount of money, effort and knowledge about Christmas history and traditions.  St. James seems to want to skip it all 
 The only redeeming point of this book is that I received it as a birthday present, so I didn't waste my own money on it.  I can't explain why I read the entire thing, and its slightly better predecessor The Rising, but I did, and I regret it.   What the novel(s) lack in intelligence, character development, and originality the author attempts to make up by describing the most gruesome methods of death he can think of.  We therefore have numerous penises being shot or bitten off.  After all, there is no worse horror that any boy can imagine than having his manhood chewed off.     I've heard that some (presumably someone who runs a website) have described Keene as the next Stephen King.  I think not.  King, though he may be "the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and Fries", as he describes himself, CAN write.  He knows how to craft a story and develop characters.  Mr. Keene has a lot of work to do, and I wish him well.    I love zombies and post-apocalyptic fiction and film, and I thought this couldn't miss in light of its subject matter and good ratings on Amazon.  Holy Zombie Jesus was I wrong 
 THIS GAME IS EDUCATIONAL BECAUSE U R ASKING QUESTION`S TO OTHER PEOPLEAND IF THIER WRONG THEY HEAR THE ANWSER ANYWAY SO I THINK U SHOULD BUY THIS GAME BECAUSE IT WILL TEACH UR KIDS ALOT.I WISH ALL U PARENTS AND CHILDREN GOOD LUCK 
 "What Is Creation Science?" (1987) by Henry Morris and Gary E. Parker, from the Institute for Creation Research, is intended as an overview of why creation science is more scientific than evolution.    The book is divided into two main parts.  In the life sciences section, Parker reviews homologies, vestigial organs, the fossil record, and biochemical similarities from the creationist viewpoint, carefully avoiding any inconvenient data, such as the detailed fossil record of reptile-mammal evolution and the detailed sequence of gradually increasing cranial capacity in hominid fossils.    In the physical sciences section, Morris reviews the geologic column, radiometric dating, thermodynamics, and the Big Bang theory.  If Parker's section could be characterized as hopelessly biased and incomplete, Morris' section could be characterized as bizarre.  Morris' argument that radiometric dating is invalid because it measures only "apparent age," not actual age, borders on delusional.    Regarding Morris' thermodynamics argument, the simplest response is that two of the greatest thermodynamicists in history, Ludwig Boltzmann (proposed the atomic theory of gases) and Ilya Prigogine (Nobel Prize for work on dissipative structures), were both enthusiastic evolutionists.  I'll take Boltzmann and Prigogine over Morris any day.  Morris' goofy statistical arguments are also fatally flawed, being based on his erroneous belief that evolution is a purely random process.  Apparently, Morris is so clueless that he doesn't understand that survival of the fittest is a NON-random process.  In any case, here too, the simple fact of the matter is that one of the greatest statisticians in modern history, Sir R.A. Fisher, was also one of the most prominent evolutionists in modern history.  I'll take Fisher over Morris any day.  Some specific comments:  1.  Even granting that overviews are necessarily superficial, WICS takes the simplifications way too far.  Page 1 states there is no scientific evidence that cannot be explained as well by creation, but WICS maintains that argument only by ignoring voluminous, contrary evidence, such as the data related to magnetic reversals, the 20 million varves in the Green River Formation, the data related to plate tectonics, data related to population growth, and the fact that the pyramids in Egypt don't show any water damage, even though the oldest pyramids were built before Noah's Flood is alleged to have occurred.  Creation has no explanation at all for any of those data!   2.  In addition to glaring omissions, the book also contains numerous inconsistencies.  For example, page x states that evolution is based on the atheistic belief that there is no god; but page 17 lists 21 separate religions alleged to be structured around evolution.  How can an atheistic theory that denies the existence of god be the basis for 21 separate religions, some of which specifically include a deity?  This sort of illogical inconsistency is repeated several times throughout the book.  (And why a book supposedly intended to show the "scientific" basis for creation science would spend so many pages on religious issues in the first place is a mystery all by itself.)  3.  There are also many, serious, factual errors.  On page 16 WICS says that oil deposits are found indiscriminately (i.e., proportionally) in rocks of all ages.  Well, according to the people I worked with in the land department at Shell Oil, that's simply not true!    4.  Even apart from the repeated religious rants, the book doesn't read like a science book.  On the vast majority of issues, instead of discussing specific pieces of evidence, WICS instead presents quotes from this or that scientist, as if quotes were a substitute for evidence.  What kind of bizarre science book focuses on quotes instead of evidence???    5.  Even worse, it's obvious that some quotes were deliberately chosen for the purpose of misleading readers.  Regarding the evolution of flowering plants, WICS quotes a botanist lamenting the lack of fossil evidence.  But the quote is from 1961!  The explosion of fossil discoveries confirming the predicted evolutionary sequence, didn't occur until the mid-60's.  Since WICS was written 20 years after those discoveries, the choice of quotes can only be characterized as dishonest.    6.  Ironically, Henry Morris complains bitterly throughout the book about how those mean old evos are always unfairly accusing creationists of using misleading quotes.  What a weasel.  7.  Finally, many important arguments were supported by citations to what turned out to be nothing more than books or articles published in the popular press, newspaper articles, etc.  Apparently Morris and Parker are happy to take their "scientific" support from even the most amateurish sources.  One citation, for example, was to Melvin Cook, a creationist bungler who concluded that radiometric dating was unreliable because decay rates were not constant.  Cook based that conclusion on his "detailed" comparison of different radioactive isotopes.  Unfortunately, in his "detailed" analysis, Cook failed to notice that not all of his samples were actually radioactive!!!    So, What Is Creation Science?  Apparently, it's pretty stupid!    WICS was supposed to demonstrate the quality of "scientific" creationism, and indeed I think it does, but not in the manner that Morris and Parker intended.    
 We bought this for my daughter for her birthday.  Like the previous reviewer we also didn't realize we needed to dilute the paint first.  Even with the paint diluted properly it doesn't really work as expected.  You have to wait for the paint to drip down to the bottom of the tube and then turn the spinner on.  Even then only a bit of paint comes out and you have to turn it off and wait for more to drip down.  I plan on returning this toy for a refund as well.  
  I have given Skinner's book I star, because it was required to write a review. I consider its ideas dangerous - for the simple reason that it represents a frontal assault upon our ideas of freedom and human dignity.    　Of course, Skinner doesn't see anything 'sinister' in his ideas. He simply takes it for granted that our notion that we have 'interior selves' and are autonomous (i.e. free agents) - is largely an illusion. In short, Skinner's argument (and it just that, not a statement of fact, as he would have us believe) - is that we are wholly determined in our lives by environmental factors, which is to say - 'conditioned' by forces outside ourselves.    Skinner's argument, then, is that we might as well accept this and make the most of it. Rather than resisting the idea of conditioning, he thinks we should perfect it. In short, if there is nothing more than external conditioning and learned behaviour, then we might as well have social scientists maximising our potential to live with the learned behaviour.    The fallacy of Skinner's argument, is that the notion of human freedom and dignity rests upon scientifically 'unprovable' or 'unverifiable' assertions. When we look, we cannot find a 'ghost in the machine' - and thus, we might as well accept the machine. But it is a facile argument. The fact that we cannot reduce our interior selves to a scientifically quantifiable formula, is the very reason why it remains of vital importance to human life. Its resistence to reductive, strictly empirical formulas, is what makes human nature special. Nobody sensible would deny that childhood experience is highly formative, or that certain genetic determinants are at work, or that empirically speaking, we are conditioned in our external lives. But we have no reason to suppose that these factors are ALL determining.    Needless to say, Skinner's thinking was informed by wholly secular ideas of social and scientific progress - much as if we could get behind everything and 'push.' Paradoxically, Skinner never gave that much thought to who controls the controllers! Skinner wasn't thinking of anything like Soviet style dialectical materialism - but, if we wanted a graphic example of how things go painfully wrong by regimenting human nature and trying to educate people out of the idea that they have 'interior selves' - well, the failures of the Soviet Union (or Communist China) tell us all we need to know.    I don't say this with any illusions that captalism and 'free markets' per se, are intrinsically more respectful of human freedom and dignity. Those values hinge upon something deeper, and without that, there is little to prevent a 'market oriented' society drifting into social controls and abuses of human nature, no less than those which drove the Soviet system.      Ironically, some reviewers have adduced Buddhist teachings(i.e. the doctrine of anatman = no-self) as further confirmation of Skinner's ideas. But Buddhism only denies that there is a permanent self in the skandhas or aggregates - a materialistic self. In fact, the Buddha taught people to take refuge in the 'self' and the Dharma as an inner lamp. Buddhists do have 'interior' lives. Moreover, the Buddha accorded 'dignity' to human nature, or manusya- as the 'most noble of two footed beings.'    It is not anyone else's business to define what we are - in any final or absolute sense. Those who would endeavour to do so are of the same mind as those who would patent the human genome,and plan on engineering an improved version of the human race in their laboratories. The chances are that those who would play 'God' will end up doing the devil (or Mara's) work. As the Rolling Stones song said: - "Hey - you! Get offa maa cloud! "  
 Well, being a great admirer of Spence's courtroom techniques and dramatics (I am a third year law student), I must say that I was profoundly disappointed with this latest book. Spence's radical ideas undermine what America is all about--freedom, opportunity, limited government, and free markets. Ironically, if Spence's ideas were implemented, there would be no liberty in America. The book is laced with brilliantly disguised notions of communism, socialism, statism, fascism, egalatarianism, determinism, and a hodgepodge of other ideas opposed to the American way. Spence would be a great candidate to run on the Nader ticket in 2004. Just for funsies, let's cut to the chase and address his criticism of the "corporation." Ask yourself, what IS a corporation? A corporation is merely a business association that is subject to the laws of the relevant state. Nothing more, nothing less. It's just a business...a business that creates jobs, puts food on the tables of millions, and creates wealth for the economy at large. The vast majority of Americans employed by corporations wouldn't have it any other way. The corporation is American as apple pie, and it creates wealth, and for the millions whose livelihood depends upon the corporation, it creates freedom (dare I say, liberty?) in addition to prosperity. In short, Spence's radical ideas, while creative, do not comport with reality. He should stick with his specialty: courtroom dramatics and six figure jury verdicts 
 I got this film because I'm from Detroit where this takes place. It's a pretty typical revenge flick. Four brothers want to find their adoptive mother's killer. Usual smartass remarks, guys talking BS, fights, shootouts, blah, blah, blah. I guess these kind of movies will always be made and when made well they can be fun to watch. This script was mediocre at best. Give me a Clint Eastwood or Bruce Willis film any day over this tripe.  
 Three problems with this film:  1. PACING - The film's pacing doesn't vary.  It's very boring.  As a matter of fact, this wouldn't be a problem if the film were much more tense (e.g., "Speed"), however this film lacks the high-action intensity to pull off such a slow expository speed.    2. EFFECTS - Too many sequences of this film rely on color and light superimpositions, and there is an overabundance of high-speed imaging.  The scene changes that employ erratic barrages of images desensitize the viewer from the thrilling "horror" scenes.  Furthermore, they fail to make enough sequential sense of the film's plot to really mean much to the film as a greater whole.  The upshot: the film relies too heavily on the art of editing, to the point where plot twists are no longer interesting.    3. TRIVIALITY - The plot's conclusion quails in the face of the "so what?" question.  The viewer is left with a sense of, "I sat through the film for THAT?"  In light of points (1) and (2), this obnoxious bit is the icing on the cake.    Don't waste your life.  ALon 
 Were a plumber or an an auto mechanic to look for supernatural causes behind a pipe clog or engine problem, you might think his skills questionable.  But according to this book, if a biologist is not willing to accept supernatural causes for the origin of species, he is imposing anti-religious views on the rest of us.  As with most conservative thinkers, Johnson seems intent on splitting the country into two halves.  Those who think like him are good and believe in God, those who do not are atheists who believe in evolution.  While this has worked well for conservatives on political issues, it is less effective in this case since it is rather clear that many if not most of the scientists supporting evolution are Christians, not atheists as Johnson insists.  It is one of many lapses in this poorly written and overrated book.  His contention that the US is a Christian country which at best tolerates other religious viewpoints suggests that he looks on the constitutional guarantee of freedom of religion as simply a suggestion.  It also has nothing to do with evolutionary theory and everything to do with the author's own prejudices.  Johnson feels that any unexplained gap in evolution supports the theory of an intelligent designer by default.  For Johnson, if the theory of evolution cannot shed like on everything instantly, it sheds light on nothing.  The author feels that as a Christian it is inappropriate to tolerate any suggestion of a natural explanation for creation of the universe, creation of the earth, or the creation of man.  Johnson's view seems to be that certain things related to Christian theology should be off limits to ANY sort of scientific examination.  In spite of the failings of the author, the publisher has presented the book well.  The physical quality is quite good and belies the sloppiness of the writing.  I am not sure if this is the best place to get an understanding of the thinking behind the anti-evolution movement but I think it is a good place to start.  I suspect the muddled and misguided presentation of the author is endemic to this type of book.  It is also an outgrowth of the book's basic conceit, that a lawyer can provide objective insights into science.  In fact, scientists may pretend to objectivity but lawyers specialize in advocacy and this book presents a lawyer at his worst.  He misreads evolutionary theory as meaningless.  In fact it provides a predictive model.  Organisms are the sum total of both ancestral characteristics and those variations which permit the organism to function and survive within its environment. It is a fundamental point that gives the theory its strength, something which Johnson either does not understand or choses to ignore.  Unfortunately, there is no voice to correct him.  If Johnson proves anything, it is that when he is permitted to provide the defense, he can win any prosecution.  Putting a dead man on trial with no voice raised in his defense: this must be an attorney's dream come true 
 After the 1700s, this play fell into obscurity. It was later revived in the mid 1900s. Its period of obscurity does not surprise me. Believe me, I am a champion for Shakespeare's underrated "Timon of Athens" and "Coriolanus." I honestly TRIED to like this play, but I was forced to concur with the great Isaac Asimov who said: "Though it ends happily and is therefore technically a comedy, it lacks a carefree fun and happiness of the previous comedies. it is, indeed, rather an unpleasant play..." Well, onto the play. We meet the widowed Countess, her son Bertram, and the elder Lafew. We learn that the king is ill and quite possibly terminal. Possibly, Helena's father could have cured the king, but alas, he is dead. The Countess gives Bertram some advice that is not so far from the advice Polonius gave Ophelia. (Though the bumbling Polonius ends up being easier to like!) Helena loves Bertram, but feels beneath him and contemplates virginity. One comical moment is when Parolles reveals that in a way, virginity is a form of vain self love. Later, Helena cures the king, and Helena asks for Bertram as a husband. Now this is where I have a problem. Bertram is made out to be a villain. But how can we possibly not sympathize with him? Maybe Helena deserves something for saving the king, but does she really have the right to impose marriage on someone who doesn't like her? Well, Bertram is forced to go through with the marriage, but he quickly decides to help Florence against Siena. Poor Parolles who knows this forced marriage was unethical is constantly made a subject of ridicule in this play. This is where I have another problem. Rather than the clever misunderstandings of "The Comedy of Errors," the clever marital confrontations and errors in "Midsummer Night's Dream," or the comical and clever passages from Jaques in "As You Like It," the comedy in "All's Well That Ends Well" is reduced to the lowest possible form. (Flat out ridicule! It is interesting that in the word ridicule, we have the letters for cruel, but I am digressing.) In one decent elemenet of comedy, Bertram makes it clear that he would rather go to war than lie with his wife. (And perhaps in time, Bertram can appeal to the king to release him from this marriage. It wouldn't be unheard of.) One interesting thing is that Bertram remains honorable in the sense that he does not 'ravish' Helena. He doesn't love her, and therefore will not engage in sex. It is rather repulsive on his mother's part how she fails to understand the situation. Even if she was on Helena's side, she might AT LEAST understand Bertram's frustration in that he did not consent to the marriage. (And possibly try to at least talk things over in hopes of coming to a peaceful solution.) But no. She just rants and raves. Later the Countess reads a letter from Helena stating that she will leave so Bertram can come home from the war. This throws Bertram's mother into yet another rage on Helena's behalf, and perhaps moves the reader into sympathy with Helena. THAT IS, UNTIL OUR GOOD OLD UNCLE ISAAC ASIMOV points out the hypocrisy of Helena: "Helena is not quite as unselfish as she is presenting herself to be. She does not go to the shrine at all but sneaks off to Florence in disguise as a pilgrim hoping that she may yet return her reluctant husband." Well, onward. In Florence, Helena meets with Diana (whom Bertram loves). And Helena thinks she can trick Bertram into making her pregnant. We then have the cruel practical joke on Parolles where he is blindfolded and threatened to reveal military secrets (to friendly forces of course) or else. Perhaps even Shakespeare felt bad over this scene as he has Parolles say: "Who can not be crushed with a plot?" (4.3.340). We also see Bertram try to win the affections of Diana. Diana of course feels nothing for Bertram. But again, the hypocrisy of the play is prevalent. If we accept the fact that Bertram should respect Diana's wishes that she doesn't love him, how do we account for the fact that Helena imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram? But of course Diana consents to meet Bertram and of course it will really be Helena who meets him. But even tricking Bertram into getting her pregnant is not enough. Helena decides to throw a sympathy party for herself by spreading the word of her death back home. Now in "Much Ado About Nothing," Hero had a valid excuse for staging her death. She was humiliated and disgraced in front of several people for something she was totally innocent of. But Helena was the one who imposed an unwanted marriage on Bertram, and she still wants a sympathy party. One redeeming element of the play is that Lafew shows some sympathy for the disgraced Parolles and offers him a job. And of course, in the end Bertram feels bad over Helena's staged death and is happy to see her alive again. Helena may very well be the Britney Spears of Shakespeare's characters. 
 I thought I was buying a "family organizer"  (i.e, a family calendar).  This book just had a bunch of useless generic lists with a nice cover and fancy tabs 
 I loved the Sunday Wife.  The book had a great concept however we were lead into little clues along the way of different relationships and twists and turns...and yet nothing went further.  The focus ended up on the one SSG who got cancer and died.  The end left me very empty 
 Don't invest your money. The content of this book is very intermittent 
 This book is one of a handful of books on my bookshelf that hardly ever get used. The style of writing and editing, and the contents, lack cohesiveveness and are so convoluted that every time I try to use it I find it severly lacking.  Beginner's books, in my mind, should make it easy to learn from and not interfere with it.  The authors' approach seems to be a long stringing together of paragraph after paragraph that blend together with minimally defined borders.   On page 65 they discuss "Comprehending Shutter Speeds". The first paragraph has the following topics packed into it:    - A cursory definition (by no means definitive)    - Visual display for older and more modern cameras    - The physical components of shutters.    - Description of how to set shutter speeds.    - An extra "note" about limitations of shutter speeds.  All this, if you can believe it, is all rolled into a *small* paragraph that barely touches upon what the importance of shutter speeds are.  I disagree with this approach. Each sentence has scant information, but the remainder of the chapter (and book) is constructed in the same manner. That means that in order to compartmentalize and understand specific components of shutter speeds, you have to grab a sentence here, and a sentence there, and almost act like your own editor of the book.  Later in the chapter is a discussion of "Lens Openings" (wait..isn't this technically "aperatures"?). The chapter inherits the same painful approach. There is a poorly designed chart on page 70 that is a waste of ink and the full page that it was printed on.  To follow up, the authors write: "Confused? Don't worry about it; better mathematicians than we have worked out the f/stop scale number. Just accept it as fact."  "Accept it as fact"?!?! THAT IS EXACTLY WHY I BOUGHT THE BOOK! To learn about photography!  Another example: Depth of Field. Where do you go to find out abou that? Well, if you look in the index, there are a couple of dozen page references, some bold (?), some not. Hmmm, well the biggest page span is 81-87, so let's go there and see.  Flip to page 81 and it jumpstarts you into "Dealing with Depth of Field". Never mind I'd like to know WHAT depth of field is, but the authors believe I should just skip ahead and "deal with" it.  The authors then take a couple paragraphs to discuss it without formally defining it. Again, I hate this approach. It's like a student asking a question in class and the teacher, incapable of answering him, tells him to hold on because they are going to be talking about it and then never answers his question.  On a positive note, I found a book that has a lot of promise. It's called "Understanding Exposure" and is very well written. Their explanation of Depth of Field is the most concise and clear that I have read. In one sentence, the author of Understanding Exposure explained DOF that the authors of The Basic Book of Photography could not do in several paragraphs 
 While the book looks to be filled to the brim with Chicago-lore and information, it is, in fact, quite empty. It tends to gloss over everything, and events, such as the Eastland disaster (worst loss-of-life event in Chicago's history) and the Chicago fire, get only a couple of paragraphs each, and only the barest of facts are given. As someone else noted, the Daileys are only mentioned in passing, in the Mayor section. Considering how much influence Mayors Richard J. and Richard M. have has on the city, this is a huge missing piece of Chicago history. Frankly, without those two mayors, Chicago might well be a different city today. The glossing over of them is a major flaw in this book.  Another complaint I have is that there are hardly any color photographs (although I give that most of the historical photos would be B&W, there are still places where color photos could be used). In fact, there aren't enough photos at all. This is an encyclopedia, after all, and photos tell half the tale for such a book.  Reading about the various suburbs was interesting. I only wish more time had been spent on Chicago herself. If you want a quick fact-book that has timelines and a paragraph or two on each subject, this would be your book. If you are looking for something deeper, keep going 
 Lester Bangs is enormously over-rated. Perhaps among rock critics he was above average, but as a writer he was a hack. His style is one of the most annoying I've ever encountered. The funny thing is, I wrote just like Bangs when I was 14 -- and that's not bragging. Rather, it suggests that Bangs wrote like a whiny, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, neurotic, self-satisfied, egotistical 14-year old who neve grew up. The style is a sort of uninhibited stream-of-consciousness which becomes tiring very quickly. Plus, it's not very funny.   On the other hand, I did appreciate the historical aspect of some of the articles, particularly the perspective they provide on early punk. Ultimately, however, there is, as they say, as little point in reading about music as in tap-dancing about painting 
 Flowery. Verbose. Rambling. Compound sentence upon compound sentence. This book was unreadable for me. I quit 
 I agree with everyone that wants old nick. I remember putting on the TV and watching Legends Of The Hidden Temple,Guts,Are You Afraid Of The Dark? and so on. Put them on dvd. People would SURELY buy it 
 If you want to keep yourself in delusions and in the dark about what's really going on in the world, read this magazine. National Review is for people who sympathize with Christian jihadists and white supremacists. Wouldn't want to be in that camp if I were you.  Read Time, Mother Jones, The Nation, or the American Prospect instead. 
 I'm bemused as to why almost everyone put a good review on this CD. Cristina's vocals are probably the worst I've heard in any other LC album. Most of the time it just sounds like she wants to get the damn CD over with. The lyrics are ridiculous in some spots, such as when Cristina sings the line "I'm a loser" five monontonous times. And the overall album doesn't vary much at all. All the songs sound alike. This album let me down 
 I recently bought this book expecting that it would actually teach you how to code and make something happen, but that was not the case. All this book does is explain parts of directX and then shows you snippets of code that goes along with the explenations. It does come with a CD that has all the source code for examples given in each chapter, but what the book doesn't do is actaully have you make a project so that you can implement the code in the chapter. So really all this book is is just a reference book for coding specific things in dirextX. Another problem with this book is that the CD installation instructions and screenshots didn't even match up with what was really on the CD! (I think this is probably because they changed the CD for the 2nd edition, but didn't bother to change the installation instructions in the book). Another problem with this book is that it doens't come with any compiler (specifically Microsoft Visual C/C++) which is necessary to make a game or compile the exmaples in the book. And it even says in the book that "the DirectX-specific code was targeted for Visual C/C++ version 6.0 or higher". I found this book's poor instructions and examples to be virtually useless, so  unless you already have a fair understanding of C++ and directX, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK 
 Nothing against Ian Fleming. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get into this book. The Bond movies are more exciting than the books 
 The story itself was a good idea. However, it moved a bit slow for my taste. I found myself thinking I would never get to the end. I don't like to give away anything for those who might enjoy it more than I, so I won't go into the details of the storyline. I will wait for the second book to be released in paperback, that is if I decide to give it another try. I like to think the kinks are being worked out in a first book, so I usually read 2 before giving up completely. I think it takes great courage and skill to put a book together, kudos for those brave enough to try.    
 The Dane Cook episode is the same one that it on his "Harmful If Swallowed" c.d. The c.d. also has the uncensored version of this routine that is over 1 hour long. The one star rating is not based on the content. It is based upon Amazon not sharing this fact with customers 
 The book explained the concepts of the subject well enough, but the number of typos in the problems and in the answer key led to many hours of frustration. I was often under the impression I was doing something wrong, only to find out the givens in a problem had incorrect prefixes, or some other error 
 I love the "smoky" piano bar sound of this album.  I picture my best girl having a couple of pops late at nigh 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 I was enjoying this book for the first sixty-seventy pages until I read Mr. Lengel's description of Ft. Ticonderoga. He places the Fort on the Hudson River. (????) Ft. Ticonderoga, so important a location in the French/Indian and Revolutionary wars is, in fact, on Lake Champlain. Mr. Lengel also incorrectly writes that Henry Knox, after retrieving the cannons from Ft. Ticonderoga takes them down the Hudson. This too is incorrect. Knox and his men took the cannons across land to Lake George (which was frozen in winter), down to Lake George village and south to Albany before turning east to Boston. I'm totally shocked that no review of this book mentions these inaccurate statements. Anyway, after about 100 pages I took the book back to the library. I couldn't depend on the rest of his facts-so what's the point of reading it? 
 Of all the Anna Pigion books I have read, this is the worst. The charecters are shallow and stiff, the dialog stillted and meaningless, and the park is not well described and in no way seems like a place one would like to visit. This mystery seems to be a big "so what". Not nearly up to Ms Barr's best efforts 
 this toy is a ripoff for 1/2 yr. olds and you'll get annoyed couase the games are SOOOOOOOOOOO hard even for me a 12 year old and in stead you should try out this game its an internet game its better than fat Tamagotchi and if you drop the tmagotchi in water it dies 4evr 4evr and evr FOREVER DO YOU HEAR ME!!!!!  go to [...] you wont regret it!!  or you can laugh at me i dont car 
 I thought it would be really cool to be part of a society that wore red hats in public.  Being part of a club where one could identify another club member because they are wearing a certain item of clothes while in public, fascinates me.  But then I started reading the book.  I found the characters non-believable.  The rules of the club, do overs and make overs were just too restrictive.  Life is not about squashing dialogue with your friends because you are too uncomfortable or too polite to say what is on your mind.  The scene about catching Harold in the act truly stretched my imagination.  The amounts of money thrown around boggled my mind.  And the ending?  It reminded me of the last episode of Seventh Heaven 
 I purchased this book as a going to bed book for my baby girl.  It puts me to sleep before I can even get halfway through it (so I guess it's effective).  Way too long in my opinion 
 Too much filler, not enough actual content regarding how babies learn and how their brain and minds develop. I found this book boring, repetitive and slow- a  real disappointment 
 quisiera referirme al epilogo la pagina 357 para ser exactos en esta pagina el escritor le llama a mexico un pais que tiene envidia a EEUU por sus logros.... y que por eso los mexicanos traficamos droga. para el escritor: By now everyone has accepted that the fact that as long as there's demand,there will always be supply, and that whenever one supplier goes down, another inevitably rises up to fill the void. SUPPLY AND DEMAND-the bedrock principle of economics- thus ensures that the endless war on drugs will continue until EEUU stop using drugs... si sabes tanto escritor porque  ocultas la verdad?????. benjamin(sinaloense) 
 I thought that this book was o.k. for the most part, but I really didn't like some parts at all. What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great 
 Filled with personal anecdotes, blank pages for note-taking and the all-important several pages of readers' testimonials 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 The film opens with a Vice President spouting hysterical propaganda about handguns in Detroit. When he leaves, an assassination is attempted by killers dressed as motorcycle policemen! [Can you believe this? No explanation follows.] Sent to a new precinct, Boyd attends an anger management class. Leaving early, he gets a chance to manage his anger when he meets strangers admiring his pickup truck. Next there is the comic relief in buying an expensive import car. Boyd encounters a drug sale, busts it up and arrests a drug dealer. But this is an undercover cop, and Boyd finds himself on traffic duty (more laughs). Boyd gets a chance to meet other officers at an intramural event. Later we see a robbery by masked men who steal 50 Kilos of heroin. [Does anyone keep this amount?]  More action occurs at a nightclub. Seagal shows his fighting skills in a choreographed scene. The film continues to develop the story. This film does not have as good a story as his earlier films. Boyd asks a news reporter to gather information on a person with a clean record. But then he is surprised by villains. There is an exciting car chase and crashes, action to pad out this story. Another shooting and car chase in a parking garage adds more action.  It shows why you should always wear a seat belt. There is a final showdown that reveals the last villain. Friendly forces arrive, like the Cavalry in an Old Western. There is a shootout that puts an end to the conspiracy.   A good movie has a good storyline, its not a sequence of violent actions. "Hard to Kill" and "Out for Justice" were better films. Seagal seems to be older, fatter, and slower than in earlier films. John Wayne's films hid his aging well.  
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 Personally, I thought I was buying a book about setting up a web site.  This book gives you endless "steps" on how-to get someone else to setup your site.  It also provides a sickening amount of URLS....  Sorry, I  see everyone else simply LOVED this book, but I must have missed it.  If  you want internet marketing it's a maybe.  If you are a web developer,  certainly NOT.  Sorry  Mr. Kent, but I also got the feeling you encourage  spam....  enough said!  Read "Web Pages that Suck" for a real web  book 
 I was enjoying this book until I reached page 176 and read the foreword to the Haroset recipe: "I suppose it's as well to start with the premise that there is no such thing as Jewish food.  This of course begets the wider political assertion that there is no such thing as a Jewish race.  Faith is not the decider, and culturally, geographically, physically, Jews are too dispersed and just too different to be contained within any one definition.  But perhaps it's simpler to stick with the eating..."  I could not continue reading after I read this passage 
 but I may never know.  I ordered this item on October 27.  When a shipment finally arrived, there was only one container of this inside!  I ordered a four pack I'm sure.  So Amazon offered to try again sending the item, but it's now November 30th.  The item has been in stock the whole time so I'm not sure what has caused the delay.  I'm just thankful I ordered it just to try it out, and that I didn't actually need it by any certain date. 
 I got this book because of the fame of John Gary and the big title of the book. I managed to go through half of the book and finally, I cannot stand it and throw it away.  Basically, this book gives you 9 principles to bring miracles to your life, like eating healthy, love as if it is your first love, blablablah. Yeah, it is true, but it is also totally vain and misleading. For example, everybody knows that if you eat healthy food and work out intensively four times a week, two hours each time, you will definitely be fit as supermodel. But, can anybody really do that if somebody just told you to do so? It has to be tricky to deal with like finding the right and affordable workout program, finding the incentive, etc.  What I found ridiculous is that John kept saying that if you believe in his nine principles, then you can do whatever you want. Even superman cannot do that! Well, John, have you accomplished all of your wishes in your life? Belief is necessary for any success, but it is not a guarantee for all successes.  Also, John made some metaphors to prove his points, but most of them don't make enough or any sense, at least to me. Another reason I hate the book is that it takes the first 1/3 to boast his former achievements, like 12 bestsellers, without touching the core topic of this book.  If you are looking for practical miracles in this book, I assure you that you will be practically disappointed, period 
 The stories that are part of the historical events and those directly coming from either personal experience or from the Guru themselves are great.  The attempt to wander into academic commentary is so incompetent and misguided as to be and insult to those who have waded into the inner waters.  It is pomp and speculation combined with bad grammer.  If you were confused and wishing clarification this is not the place.  This book does not carry the blessing of the living teacher herself, nor is there and acknowledgment of her in the beginning. Look elsewere 
 I started to read this book, but then I thought I'd check Amazon and I saw where it was selling for 29 cents.  That convinced me that here was another boob writing about things he didn't know anything about, so I didn't finish reading it.  Now I see that O'Reilly's on some sort of tear up in Vermont about some Judge or something.....boy he can't have much to do....but then I guess he has to feed his ego... 
 If you admired the young McCourt boy who survived misery and a drunken father in Angela's Ashes (A'sA), this book is sure a huge deception. The first 80 pages are a great continuation to A'SA, but suddenly the rhythm of the book stops, as if McCourt had suffered from a severe drought of ideas. The storyline becomes chaotic, changing the day-today timeline we were used to to a mixture of anecdotes that take place 5 years forward and jump back again, no order or sense whatsoever. What's worse, nice and naive Mccourt transforms into a copy of his drunken father, constant beating up of women included. It's a huge shock (hey this story's REAL, folks!); it's as if Snow White suddenly turned into the role of the Queen.  McCourt won't be the same nice, brave and funny guy for me nevermore. 
 Dragon 9 is supposed to have Vista compatibility, via an update that you can get from Nuance. Unfortunately, the update does not work very well, especially in the area of commands. Imagine opening Outlook and giving Dragon the command for composing new mail or even checking mail, and watching it do nothing but move to another message in the inbox. Then, imagine going to the Nuance site to get support. You have to answer about a half-dozen questions and provide you key, even if you have a registered account that contains that key. Finally, you are told that support will cost you $9.95. Ten bucks to fix broken software?! It's no wonder they don't have a support forum; it would be filled with irate customers. I won't even go into the problems with getting the support person to comprehend the problem, except to say that the software did a better job of understanding me.  I've moved on to using the voice recognition in Vista which, contrary to a popular YouTube video, actually works pretty well. At least when I need help, I can get it for free 
 Well, I had to succumb.  I was attracted to this alleged film by it's notoriety as possibly the worst film ever made and a few of my friends who told me it was not that bad.  My low expectations for it were not only met but were exceeded.  This film reaches new cinematic depths.  It's complete ineptitude lacks even the charm of "Plan 9 from Outer Space."  It's stabs at humor are beyond pathetic they're just desperate.  Tom Green has to rank as the most unappealing screen presence, ever!  I felt sorry momentarily for accomplished actors like Rip Torn and Julie Hagerty who signed onto this dross but, hey, they cashed the checks.  Watching a few minutes of this slop is painful.  Enduring the full length of the film is outright masochistic.  To get the stench of this swill out of my consciousness I'm going to have to watch an actual good movie, like "Showgirls" 
 I PURCHASED THIS SNAKE FOR MY SON'S 6TH BIRTHDAY.  I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED IN THIS ITEM.  FOR STARTERS, THE SNAKE DOES NOT MOVE VERY EASILY.  YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE ONLY ON HARDWOOD, AND EVEN THEN, IT IS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT TO CONTROL. THE REMOTE CONTROL HAS A VERY LONG ANTENNA, WHICH THE KIDS HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH.  IT IS UNUSUALLY LONG FOR SUCH A SMALL REMOTE TOY! ALSO, THE SECOND NIGHT HE HAD IT, THE SNAKE BROKE.  WE ALREADY HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE LAST JOINT OF THE SNAKE COMING OFF.  THAT IS NOT A BIG DEAL, IT SNAPS BACK IN.  BUT AS HE WAS PLAYING WITH THIS SNAKE, IT ACTUALLY CAME APART.  NOW, IT IS ONLY HELD TOGETHER BY THE WIRES.  MY HUSBAND IS TRYING TO REPAIR IT.  I SAW THE TOY BREAK, OUR SON WASN'T BEING ROUGH WITH IT, IT IS JUST VERY VERY POORLY MADE.  IT IS NOT WORTH THE MONEY TO BUY.  I FEEL THAT I SHOULD COME UP WITH ANOTHER BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR OUR SON, SINCE THIS ONE BARELY LASTED PAST HIS SPECIAL DAY!     
 John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.  And certainly, the rewards have come.  But for readers outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying.  John Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by Americans as the lesser canon.  Time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.  If I still have your attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John Cheever.  Updike could only dream of writing prose like that.  
 If it's true that everything is good for something, even if it is a bad example, this book might by used accordingly, otherwise, don't waste your time.  Each chapter of this book is written by a different professional writer, each with a story to tell about her particular life, relationships, etc.  I found it to be a disturbing and even appalling read on many levels.  For one, these women are not "typical" in that they do not represent the rank and file of American women, wives and mothers, at least not the ones that I know!  They are professional writers who are urban, educated, liberal, and comparitively affluent.  These women live and work primarily in academia.  The book is a compilation of chapters in which these writers rant, whine, confess and obsess about their relationships, careers, etc. It misses the point of getting views from women of all walks of life and social status.    I found this book offensive in that because they have, as writers, the platform to flaunt their deviance and dysfunction (sexually, morally, politically, etc. ), they play it off as normal and representative of the rest of us.  Perhaps in their literary or academic worlds, they are the norm, but for the vast majority of us wives and moms out here in the real world, I don't think so!  I got the impression that many of these women thought it was somehow a display of their writing prowess if they divulged more dark, freaky, wacko secrets and shocking confessions than their sister in the previous chapter, be it on their affair with another woman, a married man, or their open marriage.      The Hannah Pine piece is particularly disturbing and I can see why she uses a pseudonym; had her real name been used there would be no reason why this pitiful woman would not be carted off to the mental health ward.  She writes of the affairs she and her husband have had with other people and her obviously unsuccessful, yet frighteningly denied, attempt to justify the affairs as anything negative or unhealthy, even priding herself on chosing to not be angry over her husbands habit of sleeping with other women.   Afterall, that could put a damper on his lust and we wouldn't want to restrict him in such an negative and oppressive manner...  PUH-LEEZE!!!!!    
 This has to be one of the most ridiculous books I have ever read. At one point the authors ask: if money equals security, wouldn't you feel safe walking through a major American city at midnight with a suitcase full of cash handcuffed to your wrist? If money really did equal security, you would! I stopped reading after that.   I will say, however, that this book cured me of all of my bad financial habits. I never want to be so bad off as to look to a book like this for advice again.  
 The Moviegoer is a book about a 30 year, disaffected businessman.  He's successful and liked, from a rich New Orleans family, but bored with life. He doesn't know what he wants, and doesn't know what to do about it.  This description, however, sounds like Binx Bolling, the main character, is actually doing something to figure out what's wrong.  Unfortunately, the book just follows him around through his life over the course of a week and describes his boredom and dissatisfaction with the things around him.  While interesting from a theoretical, philosophical, existential point of view, it makes for boring reading.  In addition, the book, released in 1960 feels badly dated, about a time and place that no longer exists, so while I have experienced my own bouts of existential angst, Binx's problems are not mine and the book is not written in a way to help sympathize with his plight. This is in stark contrast to Kafka, for example, whose stories of frustration and nothingness from 19th century Prague can bring me to tears.    While the novel is set in New Orleans, there is little description to make the unique setting visible other than the names of a few streets. Similarly, Binx remains a faceless everyman, and the women he dates so interchangeable that Binx himself can barely keep them distinct.  The title, too, is misleading.  "The Moviegoer" made me expect a story about a person who lived his life through characters in the movies.  While Binx does attend movies regularly and describes people in terms of long forgotten actors, I have to assume the title refers to Binx's problem of watching life around him without participating the same way as we watch a movie.    Like the existential play "Waiting for Godot" this story is mostly about the lack of a story, and though things happen, there is little sense of suspense or caring to carry the narrative forward.   If you're looking for an existential novel, I'd strongly recommend Kafka's The Castle or The Trial instead.  And if you're looking for an enjoyable novel that truly distills the distinctiveness of New Orleans with a truly memorable set of characters, A Confederacy of Dunces (John Kennedy Toole) (which Walker Percy was instrumental in having published after the suicide of the author) is among the best novels of our times.  But The Moviegoer is a hard slog for little payoff.  
 After my older brother suddenly died of coronary artery disease at age 40 due to genetically high cholesterol, I needed to learn everything possible on the subject so that I could avoid suffering the same fate.  I read all the books on the shelf, among them Dr. Ornish's.  I disliked this book because it is rather narcissistic and is focused more on Dr. Ornish himself than on educating us about how to avoid heart disease.  Take a look at chapter 1 and you'll see what I mean: "I was trained to treat hypertension..."; "I first became interested in conducting research on heart disease in 1975..."; "I began to wonder..."; "I went to the medical library and began reading extensively"; "It seemed like an exciting opportunity, so in 1977 I decided to take a year off..."; "I hadn't had enough clinical experience to be jaded..."; "I was unwittingly giving many of them hope for the first time since their illness had been diagnosed"; "I went back to medical school and graduated in 1980"; "From 1981 to 1984, I completed my internship and medical residency in Boston."; "In July 1984, I moved to San Francisco..."  This is just the tedious first six pages.  Trust me, it goes on and on like this.  Do you want to learn about how the heart works?  You'll finally get a few sentences on that subject when you get to page 42, squeezed in between more "I did this and I did that."  You'll get a little info on LDL and HDL when you get to page 51.  Sure, there is useful information within the 672 pages of this book, but you'll be forced to become an expert on Dr. Ornish and his life story to find it.  And remember, this book is more than 15 years old.  Perhaps back in 1990 he needed to devote 300 pages to convincing people that he was correct in believing that diet, exercise, and stress affect your risk of heart disease, but that that is common knowledge and not controversial now.  The research is far more advanced in today's world.  If you are interested in Dr. Ornish personally and the history of the study of heart disease in the 1970s and 1980s, you'll probably enjoy this book.  But if you are serious about educating yourself on heart disease and how best to avoid it, I would recommend Dr. Robert Superko's "Before the Heart Attacks : A Revolutionary Approach to Detecting, Preventing, and Even Reversing Heart Disease" (2003) or Dr. Harlan M. Krumholz's "The Expert Guide to Beating Heart Disease: What You Absolutely Must Know" (2005).  These books are more up to date and provide far more useful information. 
 ...just like Hollywood and just like the music industry which, I guess, is the point.    John Travolta, playing on his character from Get Shorty (and, to a lesser degree, like his character in Pulp Fiction and Swordfish) is Mr. Cool.  This time he's trying to make it big in the music biz.  He discovers a new talent (artist Christina Milian) and works his way through an assortment of characters that are more types and cliches than real characters.    A brand name cast and yet no one makes any more than a dent on the personality radar.  The dialogue seems forced, funnier on the script than on the screen and most scenes feel posed and sterile.  Most of the actors appeared as bored as many celebrities are outside of their media personae.  Aside from a few interesting moments, only one speech toward the end made by Cedric the Entertainer redeemed the film.    It's like a big commercial (which, I suppose, is any Hollywood film).  Certain musicians get shameless plugs (Steven Tyler and Aerosmith, included in the film), various movies get shameless plugs (including, in a not so disguised fashion, Get Shorty), certain Hollywood landmarks (e.g. the Mann Chinese Theater) are plopped into the film like a tourist video and even the L.A. Lakers and the Staples Center get a plug.    It's an attempt to play on the irony of making a film about making a film or, in this case, making a musician.  So we watch Travolta as Mr. Cool navigating the landscape of the music industry to give Christina Milian her sudden and instantaneous rise to the top of the charts.  The ending is so horribly cheesy I felt as if I was watching American Idol.  Watchable, but barely.  The Player covered this terrain so much better.  
 I do not think this is a very good book for a book report on Rosa Parks.  Despite the fact the title is "Rosa Parks", I received more information on other things that were happening at the time and about other people than you did about Rosa Parks.  However, this is a good book if you are doing a report or want to learn about African American History in the late 1800s and 1900s 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 What an incredible disappointment!! I have to agree with the point of view of one other reader...this book has absolutely nothing new to tell anyone about organizing... the writers try to pretend there is a different spin to their method, but it just ain't true! I read the book hoping that someone would give me some refreshing ideas that would enable me to throw away my daytimer forever. Imagine my suprise when we get down to the nitty-gritty and up pops the picture of a daytimer-type organizer page, as well as other materials taught at Franklin Covey seminars!! Hey, if that had worked I would not have picked up this book! Bottom line I got from the book: creative people have to learn to stop and focus some of the time. Consider yourself right-brained in a left-brained world and do the best you can. There is nothing new under the sun 
 My mother gave us our Rival F69204 Electric White Mountain Ice Cream Freezer, which worked well for three seasons.  Yesterday, I made a batch of frozen custard for company for dinner.  The result was terribly salty and had to be thrown out.  I filled the stainless steel container with water, which seeped out overnight.  Apparently ice cream salt bled into the custard mix while the ice cream was making.  Online, I discovered (1) that Mother paid much too much for this item and (2) there seemed no way to order replacement parts--as in a new tank.  Can you help 
 This version, bears very little resemblance to the book with a confusing story, but at same time seems to expect that you have read the book to fill in the gaps of its story. The book was a simple good story, why did they abandon it  and the characters so completely?  The sets and costumes are great, but can the makers of such a bad film be trusted to have made them authenic for the period?  I have only watched the first disc, but it be a while before I will be able to force myself to watch the others. 
 this tour did nothing for me.  I won't lie when I say the visuals were appealing to look at, with britney in her cute clothes and stage sets, but she TOTALLY rips off janet jackson with her dancing, style of dress and so forth, so I don't understand why little teenagers like her and won't give ms. jackson the time of day when she's the one who did it better than her. I got a sense of deja vu when I watched bits of this show, I felt that she purposely stole elements from the janet, velvet rope and all for you tours such as the costumes! Janet's All For You Tour, Madonna's Drowned World Tour and even Michael Jackson's 30th Anniversary concert were far more entertaining in 2001, and way more superior than this garbage.  This garbage just goes to show that young & pretty stars are given more attention than those who actually have more talent that shines even without all the special effects in the world 
 I usually give books the benefit of the doubt and stick with them even if I don't like the first few chapters.  I think I made it to page 30 on this one before I took it back to the library (so glad I didn't spend $ on this book!).    I just couldn't stand the name dropping and superficial characters.  Their lifestyle is just foreign to me and not something that appeals to me.  Maybe the book would have surprised me but I expect it followed a predictable formula.  Guess I'll never know but I really don't feel like I missed anything very special.  "Revenge of the Middle-Aged Woman" or "The Good Wife Strikes Back" by Elizabeth Buchan are books of the same concept (I assume) and quite enjoyable.  Stick with them instead.   
 My wife and I have a small business and we bought one to use at the office.  It seemed to work fine there (I don't believe I upgrated the firmware at our office), and I decided to get one of the same for our home as well - thinking that would make setting up a VPN easy.  I did upgrade the firmware at home.  Our home network has all kinds of internet connectivity problems now.  These problems don't really manifest themselves when using the Web, but when we get all kinds of disconnect problems when we try to do large downloads, use our Vonage phone, play online games, or access online streaming content like music or videos.  I believe the router is closing our ports and not delivering packets like it should.  This product should be avoided, and if you do get it, don't upgrade the firmware to 1.52.10.  I'm online now to get a different router for our home.  Shame on Linksys 
 I was so excited when a friend (knowing how much I'd loved "The Secret Life of Bees") sent me a copy of "The Mermaid Chair." That excitement was dampened a bit when I read the story synopsis-- as a Catholic, I'm heartily tired of stories involving monks, priests or nuns having illicit affairs. Deciding to give Kidd the benefit of the doubt, however, I plowed ahead and started reading.  My initial opinion of the writing was poor, and it remained as such throughout the tome. In "Bees," Kidd wrote magically-- her words were as almost as sweet as the honey she penned about. This mermaid tale, however, was a completely different animal-- the style was totally altered, almost as though it was written by another (and much less talented) author. Basically, it didn't flow; it moreorless limped from chapter to chapter.  I also found the main character very hard to like or root for. I didn't mind that she was having a midlife crisis-- some people have their most interesting experiences as a result of such inner conflict-- but her reaction to it was childish, petulant and ultimately harmful to her supposed loved ones. For example, instead of telling her husband what's on her mind (a husband who, incidentally, is described as nothing but genial and accommodating), she runs away and has an affair. I would've been much more inspired by this character if she'd channeled her passionate energies into something else, something bold and brave and true-- NOT avoiding her husband (as though he, not she, were the reason her artistic aspirations were frozen) and having sex with a monk.  And yes, my reservations about reading a story involving a religious having sex were not without merit. I was particularly disgusted when, during one of their romps together, she tasted "the wine" in his mouth left over from Mass. Catholics believe that during the course of Mass, the wine changes into Christ's blood, so you can understand why I found that passage really quite offensive and sacriligious. And maybe that's why, when I grimly finished the book shortly thereafter, I deposited it in the wastebasket rather than in a donation pile-- I would hate to pass such a story on.  All in all, I found nothing to praise in this book, nothing that inspired me as "Bees" did, nothing that made me nod and smile and feel enriched afterward. Instead, I was by turns bored, irritated and offended. I didn't expect a "Bees" copycat, but I did expect, when leafing through those pages, to feel the magic again. It just didn't happen 
 Great photos but ponderous writing.  Page 83 excerpt, "The architects clearly enjoyed the possibilities of this experimental architectural archeology whereby a fundamentalist concept of authenticity is replaced by an inclusive and imaginative view of historical processes.&quot 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 This movie is the story of a gay Cuban writer who eventually makes it to the U.S. to escape the persecution he's suffered in Cuba. And that's about all that can be inferred from this movie. There are large chunks that are spoken in a different language. But there are no English subtitles so you have no idea at all what's going on. This disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all. Whatever the message of this movie is, whatever it's trying to convey, it's lost in the plotless story 
 I read this book two months ago and I just woke up now.   Yeah, yeah, I know: 0 out of X people found this review helpful 
 I have always been a big Epson fan.  However, I have been extremely disappointed with this printer.  First of all, it burns through ink cartridges, which gets expensive.  Secondly, I am constantly having to clean the nozzle heads to prevent gaps (which uses even more ink) so that the text on my documents is legible. It's so bad I have to clean them before almost every print job, and even then I rarely get a page to print out cleanly.  Also, the printer has major problems with the paper feed - mostly when trying to print double-sided.  After *every* page I have to push the paper feed button.  Very annoying for large documents.  Finally, when printing photos or anything that has a lot of ink coverage the colors are terrible.  It's been so frustrating I am thinking of forking over for a laser printer.  Avoid buying this printer 
 I bought this book based on customer reviews and was disappointed.  I found not only the look to be dated but the information as well.  He actually reccomends kneeing your dog in the chest to break him of jumping  up.  This is preferable to stepping on his toes because that would be  harder for the owner to maneuver-Too militaristic/barbaric for me 
 Sloppy, trite lyrics, way too much quitar. These guys don't know what their doing. Massively over-rated.  Belle and Sebastian are 100 times better than this crap band 
 I agree with the reviewer who mentioned unfinished subplots and unexplained sequences. I gave this movie a chance because I am a huge john candy fan and had never heard of it, but, I know that often, sleeper movies can be buried gems just waiting to be found (a la benny and joon)but this wasnt one of them im afraid. I found this movie mildly amusing, John Candy does very well but overall, the movie doesnt hold up to his other movies. The ending was dissapointing and there were too many, as above mentioned, unfinished subplots. Was there supposed to be some sort of development with the John Larroquette sequence? that was really a pointless addition other than to give the family somewhere to go while Candy learned his sailing and yeah, what was wrong with the popcorn? I loved you John Candy and i miss you dearly,you'll always have a place in my heart, however, this movie will probably never be watched again. I will see you again, in planes, trains and automobiles.  
 We purchased the combo a year ago. We did it in spite of the mixed reviews on epinions.com, and the negative advice of the sales person. He warned that the product has very bad reputation, that he would not accept returned. We decided to buy it regardless based on the stories from our relatives in China that Haier is very good brand name in China. The company offers excellent services in China. They tried to the extreme to make their Chinese customers happy.       Less than a month after the purchase, the combo broke down. It was a fuse problem, and common one with the machine. The repair personal came to fix it. The machine stopped working roughly a month later that the dryer stops working. The repair personal had to order parts to fix it. He did fix it again. After about a month, the machine's dryer stopped working. This time, the repair personal declared that the machine is beyond repair. He promised to report to Haier America, and request a replacement on our behalf. However, we could not reach the repair personal again.       Ever since that we started long saga of talking Haier's service center in America. They always appeared to be nice and promise to look into what happen to our complains. But they never fulfil their promise.       When the warranty is about to expire, we tried to contact Haier China, they promised again, but to no results.       Finally, our relatives in China had to call Haier China. This time, a reliable manager took action. His staff called us, and arrange the replacement. We just got the replacement machine. But we're still worrying when it will break again.       It seems Haier may be really trying, but their business model, an d volumn in US may not be able sustain the level of quality that they are used to provide in China. It's a challenge to Haier USA to achieve the scale of ecconomy, or invest to provide good services to attract enough customers.       Haier should really appreciate those early adopters and treat them well for their own sake 
 Thank goodness for Apple they made a product designed well enough to get you just past a year (1-year warrenty) and then die. I would hate for them to have to replace all these horribly designed $100 dollar iPods. 
 I love running and I love books about running. I have degrees in the sciences and am a self-confessed nerd, having read about fifty books on training how to run. Of all of these, I found *Better Training for Distance Runners* to be the most frustrating.  There is a degree of scientific complexity matched only by Noakes book *Lore of Running.* Unlike Noakes' book, this one never delivers after slogging through the detailed account of running physiology. There are some isolated bits of information, but the book lacks an integrated perspective on training.   For example, Jack Daniels' book *Daniels' Running Formula* provides a step-by-step development of a training regiment that can be adapted for any competitive runner. In this book, after reading through detailed chapters on physiology I came to the chapter on putting together a training schedule. With great expectation I began to read--only to be severely disappointed. The chapter contained scattered accounts of different types of training, no direction about how much or when such training would be advised, and no guide to practical implementation. Coe's comments often seem to be platitudes or simply recalling what his son did in workouts. I'm not sure the authors really understand the cause and effect relationship between various aspects of training and the resultant changes in running performance.  I guess that this book might be helpful for experts who already know everything about training and can benefit from some of the biological insights. Not being one of those, I found the book both difficult and vague, resulting in a high cost of reading with very low payoff 
 A friend loaned me this book, and I found the premise intriguing and the promise of an escape-read appealing. Maybe you do have to be Southern to "get it," as another reviewer claims.   Though I enjoyed the setting (which was well-described and interesting), a few of the characters (especially the preacher/candidate who gives it all up to God with something bordering right on lunacy), and the consistent battles with hot flashes (a subject I'm learning more about every day), I was brought up short by the offhand racism in both the attitude and characterization of this book. The main character, Lin, considers herself enlightened because she wants to bring water service to the poor black part of her small town, but she makes these kinds of observations: "An Oriental couple--Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese? I could never tell--hovered close to the register...A young black couple with a runny-nosed baby argued in some kind of an indecipherable rap jargon..."  Trust me, there's plenty of this to go around, including a loudly dressed hippy lesbian whose art is all concerned with the organs of reproduction, who (of course) makes Lin very, very nervous.   Yes, maybe you do have to be Southern to find this amusing. I kept trying to like the book, and failing. I guess since I'm divorced, I am also supposed to be amused by Lin's hatred of men. No men are good, no woman has a happy marriage, any woman who is married is just putting a good face on the fact that her husband is messing around. Love does not exist outside the Breedlove family, apparently, and is only seen in self-sacrificing old white women who show Lin the meaning of real love (it involves forgiving a man everything and changing his Depends). Who does this character think she is, I wanted to ask? She hides a bunch of nice furniture paid for by her husband so the IRS won't get it, shoves it into a garage apartment, and thinks it's a triumph?   Add in the mawkish conversations between Lin and her in-recovery brother where they sit on the porch and she says how badly she misjudged him and he tears up and says, "That means a lot coming from you, Lin," (this happens over and over and over again, or at least it feels as if it does) and the talky-talky-talky descriptions of corrupt city politics, and I really had to wonder how on earth I was going to finish it.   Perhaps the most offensive part of the book it is the aborted romp between Grant and Lin. She knows exactly who he is and what he wants, and he goes to a great deal of trouble to treat her with gallantry, even though he is not offering her love. When they FINALLY get to bed, after too many descriptions of his legs and chest and spicy man-tang scent, she keeps laughing at him. When he becomes frustrated and lashes out, she erupts in hatred at the man. "Oh how dare he desire me and not love me! He should be thrashed, the scoundrel! Thank goodness I ate five brownies, got drunk and called a girlfriend rather than have some sex! I am a true Southern lady!" It's baffling, insulting, and representative of the huge ax-to-grind, chip-on-shoulder attitude of this main character.   I finally had to admit that I found her loathsome and the book tedious, and skimmed about a hundred pages, just to say I finished it. No one else needs to bother.   
 The CD doesn't include the software that it says it does.  You have to hunt in the book to find the information that the software included is TRIAL versions only (you can get full versions for a "nominal" fee).  It says it includes excel and excel documents which are simply NOT present on the CD.  DO NOT BUY 
 While the story was nice and the characters interesting.  I really resented the fact that the historical details were really off base.  I study gothic tapestries and have written many papers on them, and I worry that people who read this book might think it was real. 1. the tapestry was woven between 1480 and 1490 which means brussels would not have been the center of tapestry weaving at this time.  The prevailing expert theory is that this tapestry was woven in Arras, which has given its name to big tapestries which is why you sometimes hear them referred to Arras in England.  2. the earliest recorded evidence of a low warp loom was 1501 before that they use high warp looms or Haute Lisse.  Low warp looms were referred to as Basse Lisse.  Which means that the tapestery would have been woven on a high warp loom or vertical loom, not a low warp loom, or horizontal loom.  this means a couple of things.  First there would have been no pedals and second at any time the weaver would have been able to walk around the loom and look at the weaving instead of only seeing 4 inches at a time.  3.  Lisse means warp in french in known of my studies have I ever seen reference to the master weaver as Lisse.  Why would anyone say the master weaver was warped.  The master weaver would have been referred to as a "tapessier" or even a "weaver of arras"  and probably in the shop master.  Though the use of this word did give an exotic flare it was an innappropriate use of the word.  4. the tappesier guild was in full bloom and in all likelihood did object to women working, but they weren't the tyrants that are portrayed in the book until well into the 16th century.    I must commend the author in making up a weaver because at that time the artisan seldom took credit for the work.  The credit was taken by the donor or the one that commissioned the work.  So that was an interesting realistic touch.  I worry about the holes because holes like that have a tendency to become "fact" in the minds of those that read the book.  ONce you are aware of the holes you can enjoy the story and not many people study the creation of Gothic Tapestries.  And the Gothic era is considered the high point of tapestry weaving.  Enjoy the story but don't believe the historical aspects of it.  It just doesn't fit in 
 I thought this book was very outdated and hard to read because of the English accent Willis uses. The research was OK but a little bias against working class ( poor and broke)kids 
 Perhaps I was expecting too much, but I thought this set was a big letdown. In addition to the points brought up by some of the other reviewers (missing tracks, songs out of sequence, etc.), I thought the sound quality was anything but excellent. I could see some of the recordings from the 30s sounding weak, but there is no excuse for those from the 40s and 50s sounding as poor as they do. I have a ton of 40s recordings and very few sound as bad as these do. Hell, I have 78s that sound better. It's a shame as I really like the Sons of the Pioneers, but for good quality cowboy recordings going to have to stick with Riders in the Sky until some one comes up with a better set than this 
 The photo and description do not match for this item.  The photo is for the line that is now retired and unavailable.  The description (Jane Lunger sculptures) refers to a newer release that is totally different from the picture.  Also, Breyer collectors don't want to just GUESS which model they are going to get.  Many of us only collect particular molds and or colors.  Give us some choice--every other Breyer dealer out there realizes this and sells them separately while allowing choice of which model will be received 
 This is the text book that was assigned to my class, and I am taking an at-home course.  I don't know if these guys are covering everything or not, but I can tell you this: they sure don't know how to write clearly.  Sentences are long-winded and convoluted. I read each sentence over and over just trying to figure it out. I am taking notes by re-writing every paragraph. Appraisal school is difficult enough without having to decipher and translate the textbook into plain English.  Today's example:  "The amount of the expected annual 'effective gross income' from the property, estimated by subtracting aniticipated vacancy and collection losses from potential gross income".    I translated that to:   "Effective Gross income equals potential gross income minus (anticipated vacancy + collection losses)."  It makes for very tedious studying.  
 Alright, first off this piece of crap will randomly stop playing. It started off when I'd just walk around that it would turn off, but now sometimes I barely TOUCH IT and tilt it to the side to look at the song and it turns off.  It is NOT easy to use if you're a HOLD button person... if you have it on hold while plugged into your computer, it will not let you delete or add music, which made me panick at first and fear for a permanant playlist. Also, the headphones that come with it are REALLY not worth it, they are really really bad, so go buy some nice Sony ones. AND, the song switcher thinger is a little defective... it's neat, but you can push it down and it'll hit something inside of the MP3 player that makes the songs skip and be all crazy... so it gives me a fear of damaging the insides of my MP3 player whenever its in my pocket or something. I think thats about it... I wouldn't recommend it, unless you want a cheap piece of s*** 
 I was very dissapointed with this read. The tone and diction for the book came across as overly religious, while the grammar is off-key and at times annoying(exclamation points come early and often). I never questioned the author's sincerity or background on the subject, but found myself putting it down after only a few short sessions 
 I bought this book soon after we adopted our daughter.  I found the writing style to be convoluted and precocious, much like the way children speak in contemporary movies (adult words from a child's mouth).  Sorry, not a fan.  We are still looking for a book that addresses an open, domestic adoption that can speak to children, not adults 
 Raised on a farm, I learned to respect pigs and not use this type of information for the ideas in this book. Please don't buy this useless book. It is not about the ethics we need in this country. Thank yo 
 I received the book, but not what I was expecting.   The book was advertised as a hardback, but the book received was paperback.  The book was an international edition, and not for resale in North America 
 We  have one of the softcover books and enjoy it very much and so I thought I would by this for my 4-year-old (who actually acts like Eloise sometimes). BAD CHOICE! I read through it on my own before I read it to her and THANK GOODNESS! Eloise is a back-talking, foul-mouthed terror! I can see how some adults may enjoy this book - maybe they're living vicariously through her antics. But she is no example in this book for small children. I'll be more careful next time - there definitely are cute "Eloise" books out there but this one was dreadful. If you're a big fan, read it through completely first to see it it's a fit. I must say that I was horrified. 
 Dario Argento's "Tenebre" is more of a murder mystery with graphic violence rather than a pure horror movie.  This is not a knock on "Tenebre", but having purchased this movie because it was characterized as a "horror movie", I was a bit disappointed overall.    "Tenebre" is about an author who wrote a book named "Tenebre" which provides details of very graphic images of murder and a killer is using these images verbatim to commit his murders.  What ensues is a pretty good suspense thriller in the mold of a "who dunnit" like murder mystery.  The author begins his own investigation of these crimes and the audience is somewhat prepared for an interesting twist of an ending that is more satisfying to the mystery lover rather than horror movie fanatic.    Clearly, there is very little about "Tenebre" that can be characterized as "scary" or terrifying unless the actual violence horrifies you, but a sophisticated horror movie audience will be relatively unmoved and unimpressed at what "Tenebre" has to offer in the areas of horror...sure, there are some incredibly violent and graphic kills, but that alone does not make a good horror movie.    Fundamentalists may argue that "Tenebre" does fit the mold of a "slasher movie" and while this is technically accurate, I would argue that this movie, as a whole, lacks the "feel" of a horror movie and is more of a mystery and suspense flick.  Indeed, what Argento does provide in "Tenebre" is a very good murder mystery with some "slasher-movie" like kills.  There is no question that the cinematic atmosphere that is produced by this movie creates great suspense and thrills while very little in the way of "chills".    In my mind, "Tenebre" is definitely much better than "Deep Red", but the movies are very similar in style except for a stronger plot development which is clearly evident in "Tenebre".  There is no doubt that Argento has always been long on style and short on plot development, but that is immaterial regarding its erroneous classification as a horror movie.  That being said, Argento's horror masterpiece "Suspiria" and even "Inferno" are clearly much better in the way of producing pure horror than is "Tenebre".    I mildly recommend "Tenebre" if you are looking for a good murder mystery movie with some very graphic violence and an intersting twist to the ending, but if you are looking for a good slasher movie or horror flick dealing with similar although not identical subject matter, check out Alfred Hitchcock's immortal classic "Psycho", which is clearly cinematic horror at its finest.       
 I was looking for a book that is not as detailed and complex in its description as that of a history atlas, but also one that is not as shallow and perfunctory in its survey as that of a textbook targeted at high school students. "A History of Civilizations" satisfied the above criteria but failed to evoke in me any sense of satisfaction after reading the book.   Instead of the usual way of simply chronicling events, Fernand Braudel decided to approach the subject matter from the perspectives of geography, history and significant periods in the evolution of the civilization. A pretty innovative approach, I thought. But in so doing, not only did he miss out on important details in the content, he fell short of conveying what meager ideas that he had left in a lucid and effective way. He assumed that the reader has sufficient background information and hence plunged right into the `deep end' of the subject matter. The already mind-boggling reading experience was worsened by the choppy, inadequate translation of the original French writing. The lack of illustration, annotations, maps/diagrams will contribute to the bewilderment, and not the enlightenment of the poor reader.  If you were to buy this book, just read Chapter 1 (a general review) and the chapters on Islam, Latin America, USA and Russia. The rest of the book is not worth your effort getting mired in the entanglement of information (or rather, lack of information and insights) and having to bash your way through. Furthermore, the book was written two decades ago, and hence the information presented is not up-to-date. Well, treat it as a `time capsule' of facts then. 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 And by REAL AMERICAN HISTORY, I mean empirically observed and verified facts, not some over-exaggerated facts created by some die-hard socialist with an ideological axe to grind against capitalism, which just got picked up by government propaganda artists and regurgitated by public school teachers and textbooks, such as the person below:  "Mr. N. obviously still thinks this book is complete fiction and has probably never had a United States history lesson in his comfortable life."  First of all, the book is widely cited as being responsible for the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, yet there was a previous Meat Inspection Act passed in 1891, practically fifteen years before the Meat Inspection Act of 1906.  In the time since there grew to be hundreds, if not thousands of employees at the federal, state, and local levels.  After Upton Sinclair wrote, had published, and had distributed The Jungle, the United States Congress at the time (specifically the 59th Congress) had a (now pay particular attention to these next few sentences class, as they provide far more factual information than your textbook describes) Congressional Hearing for their first session in June of 1906 where on page 194 of their Hearings on the So-called "Beveridge Amendment" to the Agriculture Appropriation Bill, where Indiana Congressman E. D. Crumpacker of Indiana noted in testimony before the House Agriculture Committee that not one of the hundreds of meat inspectors at the federal, state, and local levels "ever registered any complaint or [gave] any public information with respect to the manner of the slaughtering or preparation of meat or food products."  There was even authoritative 1906 report of the Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Animal Husbandry written. Its investigators provided a point-by-point refutation of the worst of Sinclair's allegations, some of which they labeled as" willful and deliberate misrepresentations of fact," "atrocious exaggeration," and "not at all characteristic."  On top of all that, there were millions of tourists visiting the Chicago stockyards each year, plus thousands of workers who at one time or another worked for the Chicago Stockyards.  So how come it took one lone, heavily die-hard socialist to reveal this all?  Or could it be that it just made it all up and greatly overexaggerated in order to push his socialist agenda?  After all, it was Theodore Roosevelt who wrote about Upton Sinclair in his letter to William Allen White in July 1906, "I have an utter contempt for him. He is hysterical, unbalanced, and untruthful. Three-fourths of the things he said were absolute falsehoods. For some of the remainder there was only a basis of truth."  It is ironic that Upton Sinclair then decried the Meat Inspection Act of 1906, as he saw it for what it really was, a move to give more power to big business who got the taxpayers to pick up the entire $3 million price tag for its implementation as well asnew regulations on their smaller competitors, and another myth entered the annals of anti-market dogma.   "The Jungle, by Upton Sinclair is a novel that illustrates the blunt reality of accurate historical event of the 1920s"  No, as I've just pointed out, it was largely fictional propaganda, just like Michael Moore.  If you really want to know how bad things were like during the Industrial Revolution, then ask yourself why we constantly had newer and better technologies available to the public and dirt-poor people like John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford, and others constantly fulfill the American Dream, which happens a lot less in America thanks to all of the government controls on the economy 
   30 minutes into the movie, I was picking my toes and making shadow puppets; decided that was more interesting and turn movie off...nuff said! 
 Trying to figure out the point. Language is good...but content Zip. I normally don't put books down half way. Am very tempted to do it with this one. Can't believe this won an awar 
 A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.   In the end I was very disappointed.  Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude.  He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter.  How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?  Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth.  I have no desire to read any more of his books 
 Classic brick AC/DC transformer is for North America only. I hoped for a "dual voltage" AC/DC convertor which could be used overseas 
 I find AMERICAN TERMINATOR to be an extremely offensive book.  Let's, for a moment, examine the country from which the authors hail.  Great Britain's foreign policy has been key in developing two world wars both of which required the U.S. to bail her out of.  In the case of WWII if it weren't for the U.S. they would have eventually fallen to the Germans or Russians.  If it weren't for the U.S. having projected it's military umbrella over Great Britain and most of western Europe for the last 50 years they would all be speaking Russian by now.  In spite of the hundreds of trillions the U.S. has spent militarily to protect them they have all managed to allow their internal politics to move them partially or fully to socialism.  None of these countries that the authors say we should listen to enjoy the standard of living or individual freedoms taken for granted in the U.S - far from it!  Further, in the face of the fact that Britain supports a huge, useless, parasitic Royal Family, for Brit's to criticize the manner in which Americans regard our celebrities and allow them to influence our politics is ludicrous. This book is just another attempt to criticize and undermine the things that set us apart from the far less free and affluent nations.  To suggest that we have some kind of obligation to heed the input from these sources is, once again, ludicrous.  As long as we ignore what this book suggests we will continue to be the most free and successful nation on earth. 
 I bought this book, thinking that it would offer some insight into Amazon.com in terms of what it was like to work there during its halcyon days.  Touted as a funny memoir, among other things, I was to discover that it was none of what was promised. In fact, the book was painfully difficult to read, as it was very poorly written, decidedly not funny, and offered little insight into what it really was like to work at Amazon. It was totally sophomoric in terms of what it did say.   The author should be thankful that he was not fired by Amazon, as that is what he richly deserved to have happen based upon his own account of what he was like as an employee. He was a total  slacker who treated customers with the contempt that he felt that they deserved. He was totally wasteful of the company's resources. He proudly stole supplies in bulk from the company. When toys were given to him for review purposes, he not only did not bother to review them, he then refused to return the toys to Amazon. He may think that all this is hilarious. Unfortunately, I do not. Reading this drivel felt like it took twenty-one dog years.   Moreover, this book was so poorly written, I am surprised that a reputable publisher went ahead with the expense of actually publishing it. I guess that the name Amazon carries a great deal of weight for which the author should be eternally grateful. I doubt that had he written a book titled, "21 Dog Years: Doing time @ Sears.Com", substituting Sears for Amazon, that he would have found a publisher. Don't waste your time with this drivel. If you want to read a well-written, interesting book about working at Amazon, read "Amazonia: Five Years at the Epicenter of the Dot. Com Juggernaut" by James Marcus 
 The worst album ever.  She sounds like somebody stepped on a turkey and recorded it 
 This book is average. My daughter doesn't really like it...nothing in the book catches her attention 
 This is perhaps the most disappointing King book I have ever read (and considering that I have read "Desperation" and "Insomnia" that is saying a lot).  The storyline was okay until the author lost me by inserting himself into the story.  I have no problem with characters from other stories popping up but for the author to become a character was over the top.  The only thing I found interesting about King as a character was the diaries that appear as the last chapter of the book.  I thought this was a blatant attempt to market his other books by having them referenced throughout the book.  I would guess that anybody that reaches Song of Susannah has read is a faithful reader of King and does not need to be reminded of all his previous works (which as of late have been bad with the exception of "The Green Mile:  Hey, Steve, if I wanted to read an infomercial I'll read my junk mail.  I cannot wait to read the last Dark Tower book so I can be put out of my misery 
 How can anyone like this book??? its got to be the worst horror book I have ever read and I normaly like a good horror book now and then. I mean most Horror books or movies give me the creeps this one I could resd in the scaryest place in the world yaw and go to sleep. got to be the worst book ever writen by the way I am 13 just dont wana give out my account name on here late 
 I am amazed that all these so-called health foods will add artery-clogging "palm kernel oil" as an ingredient.  Don't buy anything with palm kernel oil, cocoa butter, and anything hydrogenated!!  No matter how many "organic" things are added to it.  For many years now, it has been established that palmitic acid carbon atoms increase the risk of coronary heart disease.  The World Health Organization in its report states there is convincing evidence that palmitic oil consumption contributes to an increased risk of developing of cardiovascular diseases. 
 When I pre-ordered this book, there were no pictures or descriptions available yet. My daughter has been waiting for months to settle down and get lost in a nice, thick story. It took her 20 minutes to read the book cover to cover.  This would be great for a kid would likes comics or help encourage reading in a child who doesn't show much interest, but it is very different from the other Warrior books. Next time, I will do a little more research before hand 
 I cannot give a review of the entire book, as I have only read one of the short stories contained in it.  I read the one entitled, "Rumpole of the Younger Generation."  I felt like I was wasting my time, because  all I was reading was a synopsis of a former triumph of this man.  The case  might have been exciting, but the author did not play fair, and the guilty  party was obvious.  I did not like this story very much, and can only hope  that the rest of them are better than this one was 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck 
 Like several other reviewers, I found this repetitive and rambling.  It is also very poorly edited, full of comma splices and run-on sentences - overall, extremely annoying.  She can be a good story teller, but over the last few years they are more and more poorly written.    The books read as if she just tells a story into a tape recorder, and no one cleans them up at all.  Second Chances was one of the worst, and this story wasn't good enough to distract from the poor sentence construction, etc.  The book seemed like just another she churned out to meet a publishing quota.    One more pet peeve:  I despise such long chapters with no breaks within them. Although I read a great deal - at least a dozen books a month - I seldom have time to read one of her whole chapters at one sitting, and I prefer having a real "stopping place". 
 I was hoping for something along the lines of The Pursuit of Wow!!  What I got was a jumble of pithy aphorisms, VERY hard to read fonts, and a book that is more work to read than I bargained for.  The ideas are in the book I suppose, but a better editor could have made them more coherent 
 What a disappointment.  I was looking forward to Anne Perry's new series, hoping for another set of lively characters and satisfying stories, driven by good writing and informed by history and period details.  But the most charitable thing I can find to say about this book is that perhaps it will have been worth slogging through if it sets up better plotting and characterization in the rest of the books in the series.  It certainly doesn't stand alone as a novel:  despite its 300+ page length, it's populated with paper-thin characters, some of whom appear only once and to no purpose, carry on interminable and uninteresting conversations (or internal monologues) that fail to advance the extremely flimsy plot, which HAS NO PAYOFF.  This book felt like Perry has become so enamored of her own prose style (which is, as ever, exemplary) that she's forgotten to give us people and a mystery (or at least a story) to care about. 
 I loved Sherbrooke Bride. I felt Ryder deserved an equally fascinating heroine and storyline. Instead the characters are flat, one dimensional drones. Sophie, the heroine is useless. The plot was thin and Coulter, obviously struggling for ideas, just fluffed most of the chapters with nonsense. I get the feeling she was in a rush to complete the trilogy and her heart and usual talent did not surface with this piece of writing. YUK. I'm generously giving her two stars because overall I enjoy this author. I couldn't wait for Hellion to end and had to struggle to finish it. Usually her pace is great and her novels are page turners. Disappointing 
 Nowhere in the description of this book does it say that you need J++ or Access, however, all the examples required them.  All I wanted to do was learn SQL, not purchase J++ and Access, nor did I want to learn them.  My goal (when I grew up) was to learn SQL as applied to any database, hopefully IBM DB2 
 Beware of this product.  It always freezes up half way though the download when transfering photos to my computer.  I have another USB 1.0 card reader that works perfectly.  I upgrade to get the speed boost with USB 2.0, but this product is fundamentally flawed and buggy 
 Although I do credit this book with whetting my appetite to research further into Lilith and I did enjoy reading it when I first started it, after I did more research myself, I realized how flawed Koltuv's research  is. She makes assertions while giving no evidence (such as stating that  Lilith appears in Germanic mythology, which she doesn't), and she throws a  lot of non-Lilith myths, stories, etc., that are similar to Lilith but  treats them as if they are actually directly connected instead of just  being "archetypally" connected. She also makes the usual claim  that Lilith was originally a goddess, and, per usual, gives no evidence for  this assertion. This is an OK intro to Lilith book and is a fun read, but  do your serious research into Lilith elsewhere 
 This book seemed like it would be great from the other reviews I've read of it, and the girl at the store who told me it was super!  Anyhow...  Eventually while reading this book, I had to get out a pen to mark commas into the text.  This coming from a not too anal-retentive laid back 25 year old covered in tattoos.  I don't know what kind of person Michelle Tea is, but I think she wants us to think that she's not the smartest girl with the decisions she makes in life.  And I'm not even talking about her becoming a prostitute....which happened to be the only interesting part of this book.  Anyway, if you want an imaginative or well written lesbian book, don't read this one.  Try "tipping the velvet" or "fingersmith" by sarah waters.....they are absolutely incredible 
 The concept for the book is good--perform a historical survey that pulls together the history of the British navy and its influence on England/UKs role and presence in the world.  Mr. Herman has a very readable style.  That said, there are three critical flaws that every reader should be aware of in this book: 1) There are numerous historical errors and incorrect facts sprinkled through this book.   2) Mr. Herman appears to shape, twist and manipulate the historical record to fit his interpretations of events.  It isn't so much that he stretches his interpretation to match events, as that he manipulates results of events and glosses over important aspects of them so that they don't interfere with his view. 3) The most dangerous of these flaws, especially coupled with the above two issues, is that Mr. Herman uses this book as a platform to advance his particular views on politics and economics.  If you want to argue against international arms control treaties, write a book or essay or article about don't. Don't place a random, unsupported sentence in a book that purports to be a history of the British Navy.  Overall, this book introduced me to a number of areas of the history of the British Navy that I had not been well acquainted with, but whatever I learned, I now have to call in question because of Herman's poor attention to historical accuracy, willingness to twist the historical record and desire to use this book as a piece of propoganda.  If you are interested in naval history, this is NOT a good starting point.  This is an interesting book if you have a sufficient background to recognize where Mr. Herman makes his mistakes and takes his liberties 
  The thesis of this book is that the 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for Bill Clinton's mistakes. That is incorrect. The 9-11-01 terrorist attacks wouldn't have happened if it weren't for G.W. Bush's mistakes. 9-11 could have easily been prevented. The CIA and the FBI were giving Bush thorough warnings about how Bin Laden was a potential threat to the U.S. and the White House had documents that plainly stated "Bin Laden determined to attack in the U.S." Bush was on vacation the whole time that he could've been looking into that. Instead, he decided he would rather be out golfing and fishing than preventing an assault on American soil. Condoleeza Rice, the then national security advisor, now Secretary of State, committed perjury at the 9-11 Commission by saying under oath that the documents said that Bin Laden was not determined to attack in the U.S. When in fact the documents said the exact opposite.   I do not recommend this book.    
 I worked my way through this,and kept asking myself why. This book is the product of a certain mind set in this country that props up certain points of views and tries to silence others, there simply is no other way to explain how this got published and, pick my jaw up off the floor, a movie made.  The writing is totally uninspired. Likewise the, uhh...plot. If there is a character, meaningful dialog, descriptive passage somewhere in this thing, please invite my attention. Swofford accomplishes only one thing: makes you real happy you don't have to spend time with him other than when you are struggling with his book. It doesn't matter how you feel about war, politics, life, or anything, this is just hard labor. Yes, I've done my time in the military and in combat. Swofford can't tell anyone anything, about the Corps, any military, combat, life, or putting one foot in front of another each day. Sadly, I think that this is a tragedy, because he had the opportunity to experience much, some of it even positve, but he missed it all. The people who put their names on the cover of this book and gave it favorable comment are dispicable 
 Well, this is one of the more inventive books I've ever read.  It was difficult to plod through, however, I continued with the hope of a great reward at the end.  The reward was small.    For awhile I was being pulled along by curiosity.  After a few chapters I grew tired of the "game" and just had to try to keep myself from getting distracted so I could finish the book.  I'm glad I actually reached the end, but I'm not sure it was worth the effort.  I realize that more scholarly types think this book is spectacular.  I'm just an ordinary reader and I found it unenjoyable 
 The fact that this book has received nearly all five star ratings confirms my belief that the majority of modern-day Americans are practically illiterate.  There is nothing particularly profound in this book, and much that is mis-leading.  A couple of examples: an early Celtic Christian prayer is quoted, but omitting most of the prayer and its references to God and the angels, so that it appears that the prayer is pantheistic (which in its true form is not).  Also in the first chapter we are told that the Celts were "nature people".  Well, I suppose that you could say that most of the tribes in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America two thousand years ago were "nature people".  In other words, the enlightenment in this book has more to do with New-Age fancy and 19th century exoticism than historical reality.  If you want something legitimately mystical, and a thousand times more profound, try volume 1 of the Philokalia, or The Way of A Pilgrim.  Sorry if I sound arrogant; I'm not.  I just hate to see people get taken in by this stuff when there are truly great works languishing in obscurity because you might have to read a page three times a day for three days before you get it...but when you do get it, you KNOW you've got something.  Peace.  Out 
 This book had very few colour photos, no application techniques, and often incorrect statements about hair and skin types.  There were no insightful tips or "insider information" that would have been useful to back up my current knowledge.  Everything was rather juvenile, with suggestions such as "wear sunscreen" and the use of a curling iron too often can "damage your hair."  Who doesn't already know that?  The "advice" is not worth your money 
 What is it nowadays that criminals like Kevin Weeks gets to write and publish books for the masses. Whitey Bulger is still loose and people like Kevin Weeks probably know where he is. I don't have much sympathy for Weeks. He hates Howie Carr probably because he reports the truth as he knows it to be. Anyway I read Howie's book which I recommend. I thought New Jersey had too many criminals mingled in politics. I was wrong because Massachusetts had the Bulger Brothers. Regardless of how different they are, both brothers abused their power for themselves. One, Whitey, far more than his brother in politics who also got away with crimes but I don't think murder. Anyway I am giving it two stars 
 I took Warren S. Warren's freshman chemistry course at Duke with this evil book. It is basically a list of equations. You will not be able to figure out the problems, and since there is no solutions manual or anything comparable, you will not find out how to do them, either, unless you are a brilliant, brilliant person, in which case you should definitely buy this book. Otherwise, stay away.  This book is a summary of his lectures, and let me tell you, he is a terrible lecturer, so if you need this book for class, look forward to not knowing WTF is going on 
 There's no doubt about it - this is an attractive looking peeler. However, looks aside - it doesn't really perform that great in the kitchen. It takes a long time to peel something as simple as a potato - either because of bad design or the fact that it's not that sharp. I wouldn't recommend it.. 
 I read this book as a requirement for a class in eschatology in seminary. Pentecost block-quotes other authors for about 60 percent of his text, at which point he could've just provided a bibliography. There is little originality in thought here. Pentecost surveys the narrow world of premillenial dispensationalism and says anyone who disagrees with his viewpoint does not take the text "literally" and ignores the "clear, plain meaning of scripture." But his hermeneutic is a bit inconsistent. He insists that various parts of the apocalyptic imagery presented in Revelation, Daniel and other parts of the Bible must be taken literally.   But he then turns around and says the odd beasts in the Revelation are figurative. Okay...who's not being "literal" here?  Like too many evangelical theologians, Pentecost has no concept of how apocalyptic worked in the Second Temple period. I would imagine that, having translated the Testaments of the XII Patriarchs, I've done more background work than he did in the area (unless reading the notes in the Scofield Bible counts).  Instead, he spends all of his time demonizing those blasted amillenialists. An enormous waste of time and energy.  Then again, the book is almost 600 pages long, and uneducated people are always impressed when they see you reading something large. But for my money, you could learn more about how to live like Christ in the light of his imminent coming (the point of eschatology) by reading an even bigger book you probably already own: the yellow one with restaurant listings 
 I have students watch this video after reading the book to write a compare/contrast paper. Students generally have a great time slamming the series on all levels. The vital important symbolisms and parallels to immigration and western expansion are missing in this series. I can dissect this series all day, but it comes down to watch the series (with fast forward button on your remote ready in hand) for a laugh after reading the book. I think it is worth buying if you can get it under 10 bucks. PS (if you think you are going to watch this in lieu of reading the book, your mistaken, you will flunk your tests) 
 Unfortunately the DVD I received was a region 1 DVD, and could not be played i Denmark, which I informed you about, and after som exchanges of mail you very kindly arranged a refund to my account of the purchase price and I have bought the same DVD from another source, although I probably could have bought a usable DVD from Amazon in the UK, but this information was never relayed to me. I only have to live with the cost of importing the DVD into Denmark, about the purchase value of the DVD, but every experience costs money, normally. So thank you for your service in this matter. Best regards Peter Daugbjer 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 If you are interested in how food fits in with your life's purpose, then this book might be for you. This book suggests that you should "be mindful more not of the body for the body's sake, but of the body that the temple of the living God may be the better channel for manifesting the spritual truths." Many foods are mentioned regarding their inclusion or exclusion in your diet, but you're expected to take it all on faith since the book does not reference any studies, scientific or otherwise. The book also recommends to avoid microwave ovens for cooking but mentions no reason! Conventional ovens are OK. It also suggests you never eat raw apples. Basically, it's a bunch of advice on how to eat and live without any scientific backing. If you want modern advice backed by science, then try something else like Superfoods RX 
 Nowhere in the description of this book does it say that you need J++ or Access, however, all the examples required them.  All I wanted to do was learn SQL, not purchase J++ and Access, nor did I want to learn them.  My goal (when I grew up) was to learn SQL as applied to any database, hopefully IBM DB2 
 I was extremely excited by the marketing of these waterproof headphones. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.  The first pair was muffled and then broke within a week. They sent me another pair, but still, after hours of fiddling, cutting, buying wax, buying a swim cap, the sound was muffled and very poor quality.  Clearly they don't even think their product works as demonstrated by the exceptionally restrictive return policy.  Purchase this product at your own risk 
 This is a serious book on psychology,  not one of those "how to" popular books. To me it was very helpful, it helps to understand oneself better. I reccomend it warmly 
 I've seen these scenes in so many different movies that I got bored and  turned it off. It was just a poor copy of other good movies. (Like 633 squadron) 
 What the ----.  "A tale of revenge"?  Why does everyone in their review say that?  B/c it's written on the box cover??  This is an interesting and compelling movie, but w/ a very odd, abrupt ending that leaves you hitting the "REWIND" button and saying, "what a minute, is it OVER??  Did I miss something??"  Afte watching this, I scoured the internet, Wikipeida, and Amazon...still no reviewer seems able to say what was meant by the ending of this film.  My takeaway on it -- she is going to hang, and die (go to heaven);  he is going to stay on Earth..but maybe when they meet again (heaven), they can get married.  ??  ????  How come no one else can come up w/ a definitive meaning to the end of this film?  Subtlety is great, but not if it's so damn ambiguous that NOBODY in the universe seems to be able to define or explain what this film was all about.  It was NOT about revenge.  Maybe it was about love and obsession and sadness and the silliness of despair.   Sorry, can't really recommend this one! 
 I am newly preg too. I went out and got this book without reading any reviews. I sum it up this way: a pompous composition of contradiction and condescension. I can't stand the tone and the constant jabs seemingly mocking you and having a GREAT OLD TIME enjoying those pains you will be feeling! IE ..And all those trips to the bathroom to hug the toilet. Ha ha ha...  Last night, I'm reading her stupid book and I get some good advice on what to do with your friends who are smokers. I would just not be near them while they smoke. Period. She says to threaten them with the law that protects non-smokers. Good idea...If that doesn't work, Ask them ALL TO QUIT because YOU are pregnant. And if that doesn't work try being nice. I don't know many smokers but I don't know even one who would smoke in a house or one who would smoke outside and blow the smoke in my face. Another comment that really got me..Take a good look at your slim waistline because won't see it for a LONG TIME! (Implied: OR Ever!) I take pride in keeping myself fit. I am a little freaked about the weight issue. I find that comment insensitive to a point of being twisted. What about the first-timers who are also former eating disorders --like me. Even the woman on the cover of this book looks like a Stepford Wife. 
 This was not a very good guidebook.  The directions were not always accurate and the maps (a very important part of a guide book) were not very good. The book is poorly organized, so that you are constantly having to page through to find information.  
 If you've read one Gary Null book, you've read them all.  He is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject, but when I buy two books with different titles by Gary Null and find they are the same, I'm pretty annoyed.  His early books were taken directly from Herbert Sheldon's Natural Hygience material, which I assume must not have been copyrighted, and I felt ripped off then, in the 70's as I did recently when Amazon was good enough to give me a refund for one of the books.  
 I bought this book expecting it to be about kitten care and it told entirely too much about breed and the 'evolution' of cats. It didn't explain how to care for and raise a kitten. I was not impressed with the content 
 This book started out good but went downhill quickly because of poor research and virtually NO understanding of computer systems by the author. I don't mind authors skipping over technical details of computer systems to keep the plot moving, but if the author decides to provide detailed technical descriptions of encrytion codes, firewalls and hacking techniques, those details must be fairly correct. In this case, the technical details were so wildly implausible that I finally had to stop reading. The part where hackers were gradually forcing their way through a firewall to access NSA data were particularly difficult to read without becoming distracted by the absurd details. The NSA almost certainly doesn't have computers with highly classified data connected to the internet (through any combination of firewalls) but if they did, they could simply disconnect the internet connection if they were being hacked.  Besides all that that, the characters were cliched and not well developed. This is all too bad, because the plot was interesting and I would have kept reading if the technical details were either accurate or just avoide 
 Save your money.  Buy a book from one who has the expertise to write on this subject.  Bernard Moitessier can say more in a few pages than this  book has to offer 
 1. At least it arrived. 2. It didn't cost too much. 3. I haven't used it, so can only give it one star.    I am concerned that it apparently does not have a variable (rheostat) adjustable heat switch, going from 1-10 but maybe it does, as I haven't used it yet 
 Trash...trash...trash..the worst recording he has ever done..It would have been better if he recorded it with the Uganda Symphony Orchester. I wasted my money on this piecs of junk. And if possoble I'd like you to send this review directly to him 
 I rarely write reviews, but quoting Ebert(who inexplicably liked this!): I HATED THIS MOVIE.   1. Is editor the correct term to apply to Joe Klotz?  I give him credit for making a move under 2 hours feeling like 4.  If you want to see a good slow paced movie watch L'Aaventura.  For a much better recent indie film about family life buy the Squid and the Wale.   2. If the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well. Amy Adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb, but sweet southerner (see Forrest Gump, Waterboy).  I guess her performance reaffirmed what Hollywood thinks of the south.  Notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from California or NY.  Does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs?   3. I assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism.  I feel bad for the masochists, but not the pretentious pseudo-intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit.   4. RENT THIS FIRST and be thankful you will only lose 2 hours of your life not $19.9 
 ... I was disappointed when I actually got the book. It may be good for the 1-3-year-old set, but my 4-year-old is much more sophisticated about butterflies than this book addresses. For the same money, there are alot of other books that have more beautiful artwork. Don't waste your money-check this one out from the library instead 
 This selfpaced training is one of the worst Microsoft has produced so far. The only one that i can think of that is worse is the selfpaced training kit for IEAK 4. If you have bought it and are preparing for the MCP test. I  advice you to read the chapters in the Windows 2000 Srv RK on the subjects  for the test. Also be sure to download some whitepapers from Microsoft. The  book alone just don't prepare you good enough for the test 
 I bought this movie to watch it in 3d on a front projection system with a 6 foot wide screem . I bought the recommended 3d equipment to see it, and while it almost works it was disappointing.  They need to get the bugs out. You can watch this movie in 2D and its entertaining but it would really be impressive in the 3d mode it was intended for.  I am sending the  equipment back and the three other movies that came with it..If this equipment is improved I'd like to try it again 
 It is a shame that this book could be read by young people. Unlike other reviewers, I found this book to be biased toward the right, with nothing bad to say about George W. Bush's Iraq War (perhaps the book was written before the results were in). In addition, Cormac makes unproven, unsubstantiated claims about Bill Clinton with respect to Gennifer Flowers and other scandals that have since been disproven. He needs to at least get his facts right. I do not recommend this book because of the lack of accuracy 
 There is no reason to wait any longer for a better transfer of this classic.  There was a Japanese laserdisc release fifteen years ago from a pristine film source; the intertitles were in Russian and Japanese (an interesting combination since the events of the film took place during the Russian-Japanese War of 1905).  The opening sequence of water rushing over a diversionary dam, and of the sailors on their cots, is simply astoundingly better than any transfer we have seen released in America on any format.  If the rumor is true of a 2004 digital remastering, we have waited three years too long for a quality DVD release.  A film this great needs to be seen in the best transfer for its reputation to be understood by all.  Eisenstein directed the details, and the better the transfer the more details will be seen.  None of current DVD transfers are at all acceptable 
 I'm a big fan of this series, but "Death Dance" is a dud.  First of all, the whodunit itself is a big "who cares?"  I'm still not sure why Talya Galinova was killed.  And the similarities to her death and the real-life murder of a Met orchestra member in the 1980s is just plain tasteless.  The whole mystery could have been set on Broadway (where most of the book takes place anyway) without detracting from the (minimal, far-fetched and uninteresting) plot.  Not to mention that Fairstein is way off in her Met Opera research:  Only twelve chandeliers rise at the beginning of each performance, not thirty-two, there are five tiers in the house, not six, and there are 92 standing room positions at the back of the orchestra, not the whopping 275 she claims.  OK, no big deal in the grand scheme of things, but very sloppy mistakes nonetheless.  One of the great things about Fairstein's other thrillers has been the New York history with which she peppers them, and "Death Dance" is no exception.  There's fascinating info about the Shriners and their legacy in NY, although the character to whom Fairstein gives this knowledge seems to exist for the sole purpose of pontificating about it.  On the plus side, the sub-plot, involving a dasterdly doctor is pretty interesting; and there's a gripping discussion between heroine Alex Cooper, and a couple of colleagues involving the application of a particular legal statute.  But none of that is enough to make "Death Dance" anything more than a long, dull waste of time and paper 
 Many of these recipes are -follow the instructions on the box- and do something cute with the finished product:  cut in pieces and make a bunny cake,a sailboat cake, a butterfly cake, a computer cake, etc., or add food coloring and make a rainbow cake.  I was expecting more RECIPES 
 I was more upset with this book than anyother. I've loved every book in the series , but this one was more dissapointing.  I pictured EVERYTHING the sasme as in the movie though... thatrs just telling you how welll it's written and described. But, it was more about the Triwizard tournament the whole entire time. Still, i am addicted to the series . Either way you should read the story just to understand whats going on. I just wish it would have been more exciting and less predictable 
 Worked great for about a week, then i seemed to get an average of 12 telemarketing calls a da 
 This movie is an utter crap fest! I remember watching this film as a kid. Back then it was a scarry experience, watching it now is just plain mind numbing. This movie is beyond bad, and while some campy films can be quite entertaining, this is definitelly not one of those movies. Horrible acting, laughable demon makeups, zero excitement for horror fans. Don't waste your money on this crap, rent it before you consider buying it. 
 I just read this book to my little bro. Wow.  It's downright depressing when an author rejects her own instincts, and I really get a sense that Snyder rejected a part of herself to write this book. She wrote something the felt she OUGHT to write, not something that she genuinely wanted to write, and as a consequence, this book is about what kids ought to do, rather then what they actually do, or what is truely important to them.   I can really tell that the Egypt Game was inspired. But Snyder has since decided that her first book was too frivolous. Or at least it seems like she has.  In The Gypsy Game, Snyder tries to capture the essence of growing up.  The kids move away from imaginative play and assume responsibility in the real world.  But this is a ham-handed, teen-lit sort of way to finish things, and it truly devalues the original Egypt Game. It's as if the author believes that the children's game, and by extension the children's lives, were mere precursors to real life, and adult life. She says that imagination should give way to obligation.  This is a great way to describe the story, but it is also applies to the series itself. The imaginative Egypt Game gives way to the Gypsy Game, which is a book Snyder thought she ought to write, just to educate the nippers. Edifying fiction is rarely good fiction.  	 I think imaginative play does lead to adult responsibility, but it's effects are subtle. In fact, extended, consistent imaginative play usually produces a lot of artists, and...writers.  Snyder condemns herself with her own book. She forgets that things don't have to have a moral to be enriching. A children's game can slowly help kids become responsible adults.  A book for the sake of itself can help kids grow. In most cases, it's imagination that makes kids responsible and compassionate. They can't reject one to find the other. Imagination and responsibility must both occur simultaneously. GRRR 
 The "filler" songs on this CD are some of the worst I've ever heard. The lyrics sound like they were written by sixth-graders and the music has no character. I thought I was getting something similar to the unique, gritty sound of The Cranberries, but alas, this is closer to Hilary Duff. Aside from "Rebel Heart" (which is one of my favorite songs ever), I can hardly tell they have any Celtic connection at all! 
 If you are a fan of Star Wars and like your stories to actually be more than just characters dropping names and bumping into the occasional Guest Appearance from a classic trilogy character, then I suggest you do not read this book.  While true, this is simply a video/PC game tie-in, it could have been MUCH better!  (Anyone ever read Republic Commando Hard Contact?  THAT is worth reading!)  A story in the Star Wars universe needs to add meaningful content and an interesting continuation of the Star Wars mystique.  The Ruins of Dantooine do neither.  It is a limp, lifeless, dull read that is nearly insulting to anyone who has the least bit of knowledge concerning the Star Wars universe.  The detail is sparse.  The main characters are almost cliches.  When they do encounter the classic trilogy characters, Luke, Leia and the rest of the cast seem stiff and out of place.  The authors' only character worthy of praise was the appearance of Darth Vader who seemed as menacing as usual and was nicely done. If you like playing Star Wars Galaxies: An Empire Divided you will most likely recognize many various character interactions.  For example, the authors have an unnamed Bothan surveying for some unknown mineral or some such item smack dab in the middle of an Imperial Compound on Dantooine.  There is usually no reason given for why any of these beings are engaged in these activities or why the reader should care.  It is simply a part of the game, so, naturally, it found its way into every corner of the book.   The plot twists were predictable and seemed to be written by a sophomore English class.  (Only the sophomores would have been a little more creative.) The authors' grasp on certain aspects of the Star Wars universe were weak at best.  A glaring example was when one of the main characters, after having met C-3PO, referred to all protocol droids as C-3PO's, as if she didn't realize they were simply protocol droids with unique serial numbers and designations.  You may think, well that's being too picky.  It may be a small detail, but isn't it the small details that make the storyline of Star Wars work?  Calling all protocol droids C-3PO's amounts to the same thing as calling all astromech droids R2-D2's.  There is, after all, only ONE R2-D2. Then there is the main plot complication--The Rebels, upon abandoning their secret base on Dantooine, discover they have left behind a Holocron that details EVERY SINGLE LAST REBEL AGENT IN HIDING ALL OVER THE GALAXY.  And, of course, it comes down to a race against time to locate the lost Holocron before the Agents of the Empire can.  The question is never even asked in the book that if none of the other Rebels know one another outside of their particular cells then WHY IN ALL OF THE VAST UNIVERSE would you record all of the above stated Agents into one convienent place to be discovered later by your enemies?  (On top of that, the reason the evacuation of Dantooine happened in the first place was to prevent any Rebel groups from falling into the Empire's hands.  So, HOW do you lose soemthing so supposedly valuable as a Roll Call of Rebel Spies?)  If you read this book with any degree of thought you come to the conclusion that the authors were not very informed or they just didn't care.  (And since one of the co-authors was also a lead Producer with LucasArts for Star Wars Galaxies that comes as a great disappointment.) In short, do not waste your time and money on this book.  If you hunger for true Star Wars adventure, elsewhere you should seek. Several different series of books are GREAT and add tons of new info to any avid fan:  The Clone Wars books, The New Republic Era series, and The New Jedi Order (detailing the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion).    Beware the Darkside            (and poorly written plots.)              
 I find myself in the minority with these reviewers.  "Emma" in this book is the same character as the "Shopoholic" series main character (whose name I have forgotten already).    After reading the Shopoholic series, I was hoping to find a bit of something different in this book and I was disappointed.    The "Emma" character is flaky, shallow and insecure and for the most part so untrue to herself that I find myself (same as in reading the "shopoholic" series) hoping that something horrid will happen to her because she's so annoying and unrealistic.  And yet, the great successful rich man falls in love with her for being her quirky honest self.  I sincerely believe in being honest in relationships too, I agree with the theme that you should be yourself and not settle, that was the best part of this book.    However, I'm left feeling like the rich successful man wouldn't have fallen in love with her if she wasn't a (in her words fat) size six(which is a US size four).  Please.  It's always a lot more believeable that the man really likes her for who she is if the main character isn't so "perfect" physically.    Good things about this book and author:  Good escapism, can read book in a day, good English references.  This is why I keep buying the author's books, perhaps hoping one of them will be more realistic.  So far hasn't happened.  But we all love reading some fantasy/fluff once in a while, and for that I'm grateful for this book. 
 I have 2x Foretrex 201 units, where i have to share the data between them regularly. The units were shiped without any software, but i found EasyGPS (freeware) to work great with the units, and with keeping a back-up on the pc. I can now even download waypoints from the web into my Foretrex 201's. I have now upgraded to a new laptop, without a serial port, and i am dissipointed not to find a usb replacement cable from the manufacturer. The GPS units though, are working great 
 This book is probably a better read in the paper version.  Sandra Burr's male voices are somewhat shrill and detract from the story.  Not my favorite narrator.  Susan Ericsen's reading of Coulter's The Maze was better. 
 I am a little over halfway through the book and I doubt I will finish because it just can't hold my interest (and I am very interested in the subject).  It reads like a technical college text and is definately not a fun book.  After reading what I have I haven't picked up one useful real-world exercise to try and it contains less info about body language than other good books like Body Language Secrets or Undercover Sex Signals.  I have Superflirt on order and am hoping it has more real-world useful information and advice 
 Its some weird crap sent to Canada. Go to their website and its totally differen 
 I'm sure the capabilities are wonderful. That's why I bought it. But, it was so difficult to use - because I couldn't see what was on the low contrast (even with adjustment) display - that it wouldn't have mattered if it had outclassed a Cray. I couldn't program it without getting a headache from eye strain.If it had a decent display, it would be great. Without reasonable input and output display, it is just a piece of junk 
 ...the student confessed that he had made it up after being confronted by the professor who had repeated the story to a Standard-Times reporter.  The professor, Brian Glyn Williams, said he went to his former student's house and asked about inconsistencies in his story. The 22-year-old student admitted it was a hoax, Williams said.

 Beside the fact that time has long passed this book by, it is utterly unreadable given the tedious writing. The term "Cultural Creative" is so self-congratulatory and pretentious as to be nauseating. This is strictly for San Franciscans lost in a time warp 
 I seem to be in the minority, but I did not enjoy this book at all. The main character is, of course, the "only female to ever survive becoming a werewolf" but this was only the start of her amazing speshulness. I felt the plot got swallowed up by the author's need to self-insert and 'play' in her world, and the only reason I finished this book was that I was on a plane and had nothing else to do. The plot fishtails several times, and isn't all that interesting to start with. In short, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth concerning the author in general, and will likely skip her books in the future 
 Jesus, talk about the little girl crying "wolf." When I picked up this book, I expected to read a truly terrifying tale about how people got sick with a horrifying disease that no one knew/knows how to deal with. What I got instead was a lot of perseverating and a lot of emotional presumption.   The book starts out promisingly, even if Preston surrenders freely to flowery prose. We're given the account of Charles Monet, one of the first documented cases of the Ebola virus. From there on, Preston gives a description of the virus, what it does, how it does it - the works. Then, he moves on to the Human Component, the cast of characters, so to speak, for the big story.  The big story is, alas, not so impressive. It's a case of an Ebola outbreak amongst a shipment of monkeys that everyone thinks is going to cause awful problems to come about, but nothing of the sort happens. Basically, people run around in bio-hazard gear, fret a lot, and monkeys die. In between, Preston manages to surpass his self-indulgence to talk about other cases of the Ebola virus, cases of people being infected, "crashing and bleeding out," cases that are a lot more interesting than a shipment of monkeys, unless you're a PETA type.  The worst thing about The Hot Zone is just how self-indulgent Preston is. He starts to novelize his subjects a few chapters into the book, which is a noble idea, but not when they don't die at the end. Basically, he's trying to make you care about these people, and all for naught. And by the time that you're supposed to be truly concerned, you actually WANT them to die, because you're tired of hearing about him describe, in active detail, what they eat in the morning, what they do in the afternoon, and how they lie in bed with their spouses at night. When you're addressing a subject as fascinating as a Level 4 virus, why are you spending time talking about Nancy Jaax's hands and karate prowess? Moreover, when you've finally gotten to the monkeys, why are you talking about what kind of monkeys they are and how they dwell in the wild? Does anyone really care?  I wish I could say that this book moved me in ways other than to reverse my peristalsis, but I can't. Preston's ornate metaphors that pepper almost every page of this book are tiresome and unnecessary; he had the chance to write a compact little thriller about an averted crisis of global proportions, but he instead chose to "get into the minds" of his subjects. And what a bore that became. There were only two redeeming aspects of this book: one was the description of the African, human Ebola victims, and the other was the description of the virus itself, although, again, both were sabotaged by Preston's inability to write.   If you want to know something about Ebola, go get An Idiot's Guide to Dangerous Diseases and Epidemics. If you're pining for the namby-pambiness of the Human Element, read The Hot Zone. Personally, I like to avoid rereading the Uncle Tom's Cabins of scientific accounting 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  It says right on the front cover that it's "A Contractor's easy guide to hydronic Controls, Wiring, and Wiring Diagrams".  If a contractor needs to refer to this basic of information, I don't think I want them working in my house.  I learned everthing in this book in High School.  Don't waste your time unless you have no idea about how electricity work 
 I won't critize the author for writing this book, as his heart is clearly in it and he definitely knows a lot about what he's writing.  But I don't think many Star Wars fans will find this book terribly interesting.  It's like reading a book written about visiting a webpage... kinda pointless.  Anyone who's in the target demo for this book (hardcore SW fans and the fan fiction community) will probably already know everything in this book.  And anyone else (casual SW fans, non-Sw fans) should go nowhere near this.  If you like reading copy and paste jobs of e-mails and posts sent to the author by SW fans, than you'll like the book.  But then again, you can save your money and just do that for free on the Internet, can't you 
 The is by far the weakest Grisham novel I've ever read.  The first two hundred pages creep along at a glacial pace as the protagonist (Joel Backman; more about him later) wanders Italy for nearly 200 pages, learning to speak the language and spending way too much time sipping espresso in quaint trattorias with Italian carictatures that would make Chico Marx cringe.  When Grisham finally rachets up the action and suspense, it's all for naught, as the story eventually limps and staggers to a completely listless and anticlimactic ending.  As for Joel Backman, I can't think of a more unlikeable and unsympathetic protagonist in recent memory.  A disgraced lawyer, lobbyist and traitor that plowed through life in a meaningless quest for wealth and power, all the while causing numerous deaths, and alienating numerous wives and children is supposed to be someone we care about?  Does this character redeem himself in any meaningful fashion?  You read the book and decide.. 
 Ms. McClure has discovered a teasure trove of revolting recipes all developed to help people lose weight. I thought the photographs were a hoot and her descriptions witty. I too could have done without the foul language in a few of the commentaries. Not necessary at all. I think my biggest disappointment is that there are NO recipes for any of this nasty looking food. Some of the best haha's in old recipes are found in ingredients and preparation. Just pictures of the WW cards and comments was ok but not very satisfying. Even one or two recipes would have assuaged me. Was there a copyright issue with Weight Watcher's? Who knows. There was no real introduction in the book... just back page notes 
 This is one of the few metal albums that can put me to sleep. Isn't Enya supposed to put you to sleep? I should buy this just to put it on at night when I have to wake up early in the morning and my roommate won't get off the phone or starts cooking or something. We could probably use this against rabid dogs or study narcolepsy with it. Clowns aren't scary, either, so stop it 
 I found this book too confusing...When I ordered I didnt realize the book was done completely in comics...I thought the comics would tell a story, but they seemed to jump around... 
 I just didn't find this second installment to Nightmare On Elm Street scary at all. And neither did my Dad. It's definitely, so far, the worst Freddy film. The only bit that really freaked me out was the demonic parakeet, and that's mainly because I have a bird myself. I didn't like the lead guy either - he was a bit wimpy wasn't he? It also has the highest body count of all the Nightmare films, but none of them were that different to any other slasher movie.  I hope the rest are better, cos I did buy the seven disc box set. Hmmmm. It also doesn't use Charles Bernstein's original theme, or a variation of it, which is disappointing, as I do like that theme.  I'm gonna try and forget this film, and keep watching the rest, I just hope this was just a mishap.   Oh, and look out for the REAL Robert Englund in a very, very brief role as the bus driver in the opening sequence. It's very quick, and you'll be thinking "did I see him or didn't I?" Yes, it is him. 
 Usually, I feel like I can suspend disbelief and get at least SOME point out of other's works - even if I don't LIKE them so much. I was just lost here.  By everything, at every turn. The only sense I could see was what I though MIGHT be the intent of the film... to show that the complexities and difficulties we see as being part of Hamlet's being carry into those we might see as "lesser souls," merely because of our proximity to them, or our familiarity with the social structure in which they live, or their appearance... or age... Only problem is, none of this surfaced in the actual FILM. For me, it all came down to the moment of Hamlet's death, when Horatio says "Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince: And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."  I found myself completely unable to concieve of how these words might have ANYTHING to do with this vapid, void, powerless guy on the floor.  It was as if the death of a hamster would evoke the same deep sense of wasted nobility. I felt nothing - which, to be honest, happens to me sometimes as a result of my sporadic ability to be monumentally dense.  But in this case, I'm pretty sure it was because there was nothing to feel 
 Have you ever read a "study" that contains tiny bits of truth (usually things that are obvious) but the rest is false?  That's the case with Generations At Work.    If you remove the stereotypes all that remains is stuff that ought to be obvious.  It may be that some CEOs with large numbers of disgruntled employees are unaware of even the most blantant trends and conflicts in the workplace but the lesson there is to fix the workplace, not the employees.  All generations will be cynical if they are contstantly in danger of being laid off.    From my own experience, 3 examples that are completely the opposite of what this book describes.  (1) People in my age group are supposed to be driven overachievers.  How I wish that were true.  Must have come from astrology or something.  (2) I worked for a company that hired two young "golden collar" tech experts.  These kids were outstanding.  There were no personality conflicts.  There were no generational conflicts.  And the fact that they were so knowlegable made us worship them!  So what if they preferred rock climbing to golf?  (3) Speaking of stereotypes, the company shut down and we all got laid off.  According to this book, young IT professionals can write their own ticket, right?  False, again.  Four months have passed and one of our young geniuses has a boring job with a long commute and big pay cut.  The other has refused to take a crummy job and remains unemployed.  The book is not without humor, perhaps unintentional.  Apparently Lucent is a good example of how waring generations can make peace.  But I wonder how many managers want their company to perform as Lucent has.    In the end, the key to a productive harmonious workplace is for people to have jobs they enjoy, pay well and are reasonably secure.  In a lesser work environment all managers can hope for is to tap into the stereotypes in this book to try to keep the dust down 
 I bought this along with several other books on Montana. Its a good resource and has a lot of information, but I found it was hard to use. It was more like a textbook that required me to dig and take notes. While they  did provide a few maps, they were sketchy and really didn't help me find  where things were located. This is compared to the Montana Roadside  Directory which I found to be nicely laid out, and easy to use. I would  still recommend the purchase of this if your planning a trip as a  supplement to other information. It was my second favorite book of the  several I bought 
 The episodes in this series have an average running time of 50 minutes. This one happens to be only 18 minutes. This mean sthat the file abruptly stops right in the middle. Even though it only cost me $2 I still got jipped.  Let's hope Amazon can iron out these kinds of problems before they get this service farther underway. Be careful enough to sheck the running times to be sure they seem accurate before you buy them 
 This was strange book. It was short but had some very exciting sequences. However, it appeared that the author got bored with what he was writing and just stopped the book mid stream with no ending. Had he written a full 400-500 pages he would have had a winner for readers of this genre up there with Clancy and Coyl 
 Five crime stories. I read the first. Damn, ain't no way to solve the thing until you read the last page, and I waded through all kinds of cardboard cutouts and cliches to get there. I quit reading. 
 Although there is much practical advice and interesting facts about child development, the overall result is a tired and dated manual. Some of the advice is downright dangerous!  The book explored the conflict between putting infants to sleep on their back as opposed stomach. There is a  clinically accepted link between Babies sleeping on their stomach and SIDS,  Sudden Infant Death Syndrom. There isn't a pediatrition or health nurse on  the planet who would recomend putiing an infant to sleep on their belly, let  alone give an option between the two 
 The ideas are trite, the prose is pre-sophomoric, and the little introductions by the author that precede each story are nauseatingly self-centered. One of them (preceding "Shadow of the Mothaship") says: "The way I write stories is really stupid [...]". Hear, hear! I can't imagine why Bruce Sterling endorsed this puerile effluvium 
 'How to get the most from your MySpace promotion' reads the promiss on the backcover of the book. But this promiss is certainley NOT true at all. Bob Baker wrote only 48 pages of the book himself, which text is a summary of the results of a questionaire done by Bob through MySpace. The other 70 pages or so are written by '30 indie music people' (how about giving them a credit on the cover of the book, Bob?). These are the raw, full length responses from the 30 artists, managers and promotors who responded to Baker's MySpace Music Marketing Tips survey. Therefore, the following 4 boring questions are repeated 30 times: - General thoughts on MySpace as a promotion tool; - Top MySpace marketing tips; - Biggest MySpace drawbacks; - Additional MySpace thoughts. You do not need to buy the book, because here are the results: - yes, MySpace can be a promotional tool for a band, besides other promotional tools; - blog, blog, blog (be active); - there are over 2 million artists you are competing with; - MySpace is super time-intesive and the site is very very slow. That's it. I certainley do not understand the halleluja-words on the backcover of the book 
 To the review two spots below me, you are not alone. I agree that those aspects are f'ed up. I read reviews about this movie saying it's the best movie about the punk culture and perfectly portrays punk rock in the 80's. Well if that is the case than maybe punk rock failed me. I've learned that that is not what the punk culture is about and should be against such actions and opinions as those acted out in this movie (Oh and speaking of the acting.. it sucks. The acting is horrible. So the director got real kids and not actors? No matter to me, that definately ruined the movie for me). Sorry about that. Anyways, this movie is nothing at all about punk rock. And if this is what punk was in the in the 80's then, sorry to those who feel a strong connection with it, I personally am against it and think it was a horrible thing. Bands in the 80's sang about antisexism, anti racism, and politics and topics like that. This movie didn't show any of this and really didn't give any indication of what punk was back then. Finally, if you want a "punk rock" movie than I don't recommend this but rather SLC Punk or something. Now I know that that movie doesn't get great reviews because he "sold out" at the end. Well the majority of those reviews are written by "punks" whom are still in their teens or early twenties and, to me, will sell out just like he did in that movie so don't bother with Suburbia and watch some other "punk" movie 
  It's the polar opposite of good writing.  It's so familiar, so conversational, so unturgid, and so padded with fluffy stuff it's unreadable.  Even worse than I figured it would be.  Oh, well, now i know after wondering all these years. 
 "So does the author work for the RIAA?" Was my first thought when poking throught this book. Nice content overall, but I simply cannot recommend this book based on one thing alone : The author uses the term "stealing" when discussing copyright infringement. Get it straight! There is a clear legal difference between 'stealing' and 'infringement'. To state things in this manner is not only misleading, but an out-and-out intentional falsehood. Just because the author feels a certain way does not make it law. In this day and age, there is absolutely NO EXCUSE for using incorrect terms like this in a book specifically about the legal aspects of music. Thumbs way down: 
 Another attempt to "blame whitey" for all the ills of others.  Hey, who enslaved your people in the first place?  Answer that!  My answer to those who blame America for everything is the same regardless of race, color or creed:  America, Love it or Leave it!  JFK put things in perspective when he said, "Ask not what your country can do for you.  Ask rather what you can do for your country.  As hurricane Katrina showed, those who wait around and expect their government to save them are in for a big disappointment.  Those who heeded the warnings and got to higher ground are fine.  As tragic as it is, those who followed the advice and mindset of the author of this book, well many of them didn't make it.  A good slice of those that did showed their true colors during days of ugly anarchy - the video speaks for itself.  This author has a problem that when you saw whites looting a place they primarily came out with food and water and others took guns, electronics, etc.  The video doesn't lie - don't be too blind to see or too foolish to admit the truth 
 We bought this toy for Christmas.  We have tried everything suggested to try to get it to work.  The handheld can be played, but we havn't been able to get it to display on the tv.  I called the tv manufacturer to make sure I,m on the right channel and that the tv is set up properly.  Vmigo comes with a small pamphlet on how to use the handheld (this is good).  The other four section paper is full of suggestions on how to get it to work with the tv which includes the numbers for 30 different tv manufacturers. Still can't get it to connect to the tv.  We connect three different gaming systems to the same tv with out any problems,one at a time that is. It is very frustrating. I have already make sure that the handheld is in full play mode before inserted into docking system 
 This unfounded work is by far the worst case of historical revisionism I have yet to encounter in my studies.  I was assigned this book in a history course, and found it to be extremely biased with no references whatsoever.  Michael CC Adams simply notes things such as "various editions of Time Magazine from the 1940's" as his references.  Adams makes broad claims that he fails to backup.    He does not include both sides of the story.  For example, when talking about the battle of Okinawa he states that ONLY 7,000 Americans (the lowest figure I have ever encountered anywhere is 13,000) died whereas the United States "brutally" killed 110,000 Japanese.  Adams does not even mention the enslavement of the Okinawan people by the Japanese forces or the extreme difficulties involved in taking such a difficult objective.  He states "over 1500 shells were expended per Japanese kill", claiming this was "overkill."  This is just one example of his twisted view of World War II.    If someone is going to undertake such an extreme view of the past, they should certainly reference it, and include both sides of the story.  
 I was a little cynical of all the superlative-tossing regarding Carnavas, yet I tried to approach my first listens with an open mind.  Ultimately I was disappointed with it, in part because the album was hyped as some sort of indie masterpiece.  Instead, it sounds similar to endless amounts of emo/punk that has been churned out over the last decade.  I had trouble listening to the album without being constantly reminded of The Juliana Theory.  Perhaps if the Silversun Pickups had released this album in 1998, they would have found something greater than a niche following.  In 2006, however, they sound little but worn and dated 
 I cannot believe this is the same person who wrote that fantastic book, Absolute Power.  David, what happened????  The story is very fascinating but the characters were not.  I found myself rooting for the villian who is definitely a very bad person.  But our herione, LuAnn, is not believable.  He has her as a backward hick who does not have a social security number on one hand and then he has her acting like a genius on the other hand.  There were just too many up and downs for me.  I am sure the next book will be back on track 
 This is a barely passable pulp fiction "mystery" novel from Jonathan Kellerman revolving around a sex murder and some questionable rich kids.   In essence, this book is pretty much completely predictable, and burdened by lengthy explanations that, by the time you get to them, you've either guessed or stopped caring about.  The book starts off with premise - a young woman is brutally murdered and sexually molested, with no apparent leads, a cold case 20 years old - but it quickly degenerates, and the true perpetrators are apparent from early on.    Even as a light holiday, poolside, read - this book is lacking.  There are way too many lucky breaks and coincidences (the main character just happens to be old friends with a key witness' shrink) for this book to even approach plausible.  The characters are one dimensional and boring.  Even Milo, the gay cop, is just... boring.  Cliched.  A shabby excuse for a fleshed out character.    Give this book a pass - seriously.  I'm sure there are much better books to spend your $6 - $8 on. 
 Over the years, I have tried in vain to purchase the "real" original version.. Yes, Donny Osmond is decent and all.. I grew up watching him and his family on tv.. But concerning this title, they try to pass off the various versions on this site and in stores as "The Original Version".. It's not... I have the "Real" Original version on vinyl.. I've been looking to replace it on CD..  The "real" original has been way overshadowed, if not completely forgotten, by the various versions over the years with cast after different cast.. The "Real" original was actually recorded and released in 1971 ("After" Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), not before it).. It was performed by The Joseph Consortium, on Scepter Records, and had a black cover with a small litho-drawing of Joseph in a white and gold coat.. The front of the cover had a "flap" that opened up and told about the album.. The "real" original version blows all these versions out of the water.. I know because I bought them all, in hopes that one "was" the real version.. I give up.. If anyone has a cassette version or a CD performed by The Joseph Consortium (The "real" original version) and want to part with it, leave a message here and hopefully we can hook up and work something out.. Here's to hoping.. Thanks.. 
 There's weird but listenable (see: Bjork).  Then there is acquired taste (see: Stina Nordenstam).  And then there is quirky but endearing (see: Joanna Newsom).  And after all that we hit Coco Rosie who are weird, quirky and an acquired taste but, if we are being brutally honest, there is not enough of the listenable and endearing about their music to make you tolerate the oddities.  For some this will be a delight and they will rave about the album till the cows come home.  But most should be warned, this is eclectic in the extreme and simply does not have enough good tunes to make it a worthwhile listen.  A shame, really 
 Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam Phillips's debut 'The Indescribable Wow', an album I love so much I thought I'd give 'Song Cycle' a shot.  What a feeerocious disappointment! I'd give it zero stars if I could, but amazon wouldn't let me!   My god, that singing voice of his reminds me of David Bowie... "The Laughing Gnome" Bowie, that is... I've seen the word "coy" pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing, er, style, but I'll go them all one better... "smug". All I hear in it is "Ooh, I'm so smart. What a clever lad am I."   The arrangements or orchestrations, or whatever you call them are all pointless. It gives me the feeling that Van's dad bought him an orchestra and said, "Here, son, have fun." So young Van did... without ever really learning how to use it properly. Randy Newman KNOWS how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'Sail Away'. The arrangements are tasteful and, key word here, SPARE. He never clubs us over the head with them.   The lyrics, if we can call them such, have no attachment whatsoever to the music.... but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I guess it's to be expected. So, what we have is a trifecta of awfulness: bad voice, bad lyrics, and bad music.  HOWEVER, he did make 'Song Cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years, namely that arrangements are NOT songs; they're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him that... 
 My wife got this book when homeschooling and my daughter picked out the motor experiment. We followed the directions but could not get the motor to work. After looking at the design I realized the armature winding was incorrect. The winding must go around the cork in parallel with the axis, not around the axis. Needless to say a child trying to build this would be extremely frustrated. I have a feeling the author did not build all the experiments. The lack of explanation of how the motor works is also a drawback 
 While I highly agree that many defenses belong in the waste basket, Dershowitz waxes self righteous to such a high pitch its tough to deal with.  First of all, he doesn't see the forest from the trees.    I saw MSNBC investigates on television and saw the tortuous struggle prisoners face in prison.  Many of them were literally nice guys.  They weren't rapists, murderers or such.  But they stole cars, broke into houses, or belonged to a gang.  They are ruined lives.  But their lives are not ruined by their own acts but by the acts of a draconian justice system that is thrilled to impose harsh punishment for their mistakes.  In other words, there is a shift in the content of our law.  It is okay to celebrate sodomites on television, recklessly debauch children with illicit television, abort innocent babies who never committed a crime, and so on, but don't dare violate the leviathan state.  If you don't pay your taxes, if you rob a bank (poor bank), if you punch a cop who is trying to shoot you or abuse you, if you insult a judge whose arrogance knows no bounds, if you are a conscientious objector and so on -- you will pay the ultimate price.  This shift in the content of the law is given physical manifest with the removal of the Ten Commandments from the Alabama Supreme Court.  Who goes to jail?  Allegedly, the anti-social.  But, we punish many prisoners so harshly there is a tacit presumption they are sociopaths who deserve that level of punishment.  Yet, I have met many cops, judges, bureaucrats, ABA board members, AMA board members, teachers, and people from the department of licensing, politicians and so on who exhibit a cruelty that exceeds some of the worst prisoners I've seen.  They delight in cruelty and being downright ornery.  Yet, they're not in jail.  They've ruined careers, destroyed reputations, shot and killed people, imposed burdens on people who already suffer from barely endurable burdens, foreclose on houses, deny paying insurance claims, but "it's the law."  There is a devious sort that likes to commit their crimes under color of law.  They're not clever when they do this.  They're cowards who hide behind the proxy of power.    I beg to differ from Dershowitz because he focuses on the wrong rascals.  This is misdirection or a blind spot that is intolerable.  Like Tony Montana said, "You people need people like me, so you can point your filthy finger and say there's the bad guy."  Define a criminal as an Italian gangster or a black hoodlum and you won't notice the worse ones who embezzle your tax dollars, commit treason, impose usurious interest rates, recklessly expose your children to filth on television, violate their oath of office by representing AIPAC instead of the American people (as our legislator does) or quoting foreign precedent (as our Supreme Court does who allegedly swear to uphold the laws of OUR land, not someone else's land), utility companies who are subsidized by your tax dollars (allegedly for the public good) but who turn around and charge you for that power your tax dollars created, et cetera.  We need to step back and reevaluate our concept of the bad guy, that hallmark of "irresponsibility."  If we don't' do this, God help this country. 
 I tried as hard as I could but just could not get into this book.  Not quite as bad as her book, "Impossible," but close.  Danielle Steel is getting so repetitive in her writing.  Basically, this book repeated over and over how much Quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn't realize how much she meant to him until she was dying/dead.  Drivel.  She could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves, but no.  A waste of time.  Very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all.  Disappointing, to say the least.  
 I'm a big fan of Dan Poynter's book The Self-Publishing Manual, so I expected that this book would be of comparable quality.  Unfortunately, that just isn't the case.  There is some information relating to the "new book model" publication process that should be helpful, but what little information exists is difficult to extract from this book which has been very poorly designed and laid out.  The pages are constantly broken by quotes that loosely relate to the text, and this makes it difficult for the actual content to read smoothly.  The text itself seems disjointed as if Poynter has just copied and pasted passages of previous articles together, and little attention has been paid to making this a coherent and informative book.  The graphics used in the book are of poor quality- an obvious example of someone who doesn't know how to prepare graphics for print and an indication that this book was just slapped together.  I hope this isn't what Dan Poynter means by "The New Book Model", as this was an incredibly disappointing book both aesthetically and as a text.    While I think electronic publishing is a medium that's here to stay and incredibly valuable, I do disagreee with Dan Poynter's assertion in this book that "the only ink-on-paper ('dead tree') books in the future will be coffee table books- books as an art form.  These books will be used to decorate homes and offices.  Other information will be disseminated electronically without sacrificing trees."  Certainly this will never happen as long as "new book model" publishers publish books of this quality.  Consumers will demand books of greater informational value that present the information in an easy-to-absorb and attractive manner, which, I'm disappointed to discover, Dan Poynter is willing to sacrifice.  In any case, the fact is there are actually more trees growing in the United States now as a result of our vast use of paper and lumber than there were 200 years ago.  The "save the trees" argument for e-publishing is just wrong.  There are a lot of good reasons to e-publish, but trees aren't among them.  It's worth noting that far fewer trees would have died in the printing of this book had the author left out the exessive quotes and textboxes that pad this book's page-count.  All in all, I'm disappointed with Writing Nonfiction.  The information in this book that is of any value really belongs in Poynter's infinitely better and more comprehensive book, The Self-Publishing Manual.  One chapter would cover it.  I also recommend Avery Cardoza's The Complete Guide To Successful Publishing.  
 Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music.  Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him.  Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages 
 Although solidly made, this is a VERY SMALL whisk.  Nine inches sounds big, but this will only suffice for whisking 2-3 eggs, or for those occasions when you don't want a full sized whisk.  I was disappointed in it when it arrived.  It's not what you want if you think it's a regular sized whisk 
 Thirteen year olds can be easily impressed by cheap tricks, "heartfelt" lyrics, and a lot of pretty lights. So it goes with some reviewers of this movie. This movie contains the unending internal reflections of about 6 or 7 different characters. These reflections never really go anywhere, never draw substantive conclusions. Primarily, there is just a lot of whining. THe only exception is the Sean Penn character until the end, when he whines at least as much as everybody else. "War is tough" is one of the main themes of this movie. Is that really a revelation?   One thing you learn early on in acting or directing classes is to "play opposites," meaning put contrasting things in juxtaposition so that the contrast highlights both sides. An example is when a very evil character such as Richard III uses humor. "I'll have her - but not for long." THe fact that the guy is joking about killing his new bride makes him all the more evil to us. At the same time, perhaps we can't avoid laughing in spite of ourselves.  OK, so this director had some of the same classes I did, but he has to use the technique over and over and over and over and over and ... until it starts seeming boring and banal. War scene, lots of dying. Oh look, a pretty butterfly! More blood and bullets. Oh gee, the light going through that leaf is beautiful! Use this trick once or twice and maybe it seems new to the uninitiated audience. Use it more than three times and you are asking for trouble. This director must use it 10-15 times. He turns it into a cliche. When the audience can predict when they are about to see the next opposite, you have overdone it.  So what do we have so far? A bunch of whining character crying about war being bad and a bunch of contrast scenes. And really, that's pretty much it. The movie could have been cut in half with no loss because if there is one thing this movie is, It Is Redundant. It is spoon-feeding you the same message over and over and over again. Ouch, war hurts! Ew, mutilated bodies are yucky. Oh gosh, a little bird got hurt!!! We are so nasty! We must stop this war!!! (never mind the fact that thousands of little birds get eaten alive by cats every day)  The director focuses on the yucky and inconvenient aspects of war - which I suppose would be briliant, except I think almost everybody on the planet already knows that wars are yucky and inconvenient. It's almost as if the author doesn't Believe we know, that he somehow thinks we missed it. And if only he reminds us at every possible repetitive opportunity, again and again and again, well, then maybe we will "get it" and start opposing wars, I guess. Never mind about Hitler and the 6 million jews. Never mind about Pearl Harbor. War is a yucky thing done by bad men, or nice whimpy men trapped in a situation by bad men. It has no meaning and there is nothing remotely noble about it. We were just wasting our time fighting the Nazis. The Nazis were just misunderstood! If they want to cook 6 million jews in the ovens, let them do it.  An adult movie deals with realties and poses questions like, "how do I get myself to do something that I don't want to do, but that I know I should?" Making yourself do things that are not pleasant is one of the hallmarks of reaching adulthood. This movie takes a very adolescent perspective and asks, "if I whine enough, can I get out of my chores?"   The dumbest scene in this movie is when the Jim Caveziel character is surrounded by Japanese and for no reason whatsoever, will not surrender. He stands there in the middle of about 40 Japanese soldiers and decides (after looking at some pretty leaves and butterlies) to raise his weapon so they will shoot him. The funny thing is, it's completely unnecessary: his comrades have already been warned. His death accomplishes nothing but relief for the audience - he can no longer utter his inane internal monologues.   I think if you are a left-winger or have a thing for looking at the bodies of naked boys, you will love this movie. It's the kind of propaganda piece that a vacant, unquestioning mind will eat up. If your leanings are more adult, however, you may hate it. You'll wonder why the story is so one-sided, why nobody seems to believe in the causes they are fighting for, even though the Japanese did attack us, and the Germans did some naughty things too. None of that seems to matter to the storyteller. "Why can't we all get along?" he cries, as the germans load another group of jews into the ovens and turn up the heat...  A final note: if you want to see two really good war movies that make valid criticisms of the "war spirit" and how wars are conducted, see "Gallipoli" and/or "Breaker Morant." These movies are extremely effective in making their points without using cartoonish characters. The characters are real and the plots move the story foreward.  "The Thin Red Line" is what I would call "professed brilliance." A couple of simple tricks are used to try to impress the audience. But there is no real meat here. It's just a bunch of pointless whining. The poetry is poorly written and pretentious. And the characters are not real.   
 I was looking for a book that would give me guidance to diet, not one that was meant to analysis my feelings like going to a head doctor. It was a  real disappointment and a waste of my hard earned money. Other books by the  Heller's are of more benefit 
 It's quite hilarious, what people will believe.  I do not see why people contradict the DNA evidence and the fact that Anna Anderson didn't look at all like the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna.  It's quite pathetic, this woman, a psychopath who grew into her role as the "lost grand duchess".  There needs to be a better memoriam to the girl, not the crazy woman who said she was she.  It's absolutely laughable, all the things he says in this book.  It reads more like a tabloid, what with a secret fifth daughter and all this other junk 
 In the years since September 11th, 2001 many authors have tried their hands at the 9/11 novel, with all of its delicate subject matter, and thus far they have met with only limited degrees of success: Jonathan Safran Foer, Julia Glass, Wendy Wasserstein, and others have centered novels on the pre- and post-9/11 era, and now Claire Messud takes her turn with "The Emperor's Children," a novel set during the months preceding and immediately following that horrific day. The titular 'emperor' is Murray Thwaite, a prestigious journalist living the quintessential Manhattan lifestyle: fame, money, parties, and the adoration of literati and socialites alike. He has cultivated an image based on truth and integrity, although those charactersitics are notably lacking in his actual person. His 'children' are the people immediately surrounding him, captivated by his presence and hoping to coast on his celebrity with varying degrees of maliciousness. At the novel's onset most of them are suffering from some form of paralysis about their life's direction. First and foremost is Marina, Murray's daughter, who seems hopelessly trapped in a prolonged adolescence -- afraid that if she grows up and tries to make her way in the world she will be unable to live up to her famous father's reputation (the thought of disappointing him is particularly troubling to her). It is easy to forget that Marina is 30 years old because she is quite deliberately written like a high school aged socialite. Then there is Murray's nephew, Frederick "Bootie" Tubb,  who has grown up in awe of his distant uncle and comes to Manhattan after dropping out of college to ask him to be his mentor. Bootie, an intelligent but overly philosophical and idealistic young man, quickly becomes disillusioned with Murray (for who could possibly live up to the lofty expectations that celebrity produces?), and becomes determined to expose his uncle for the charlatan he believes him to be. Complicating things further is Ludovic Seeley, a smarmy Australian businessman who has come to Manhattan to start his own magazine -- and aims to shake up the existing journalistic order by dethroning the reigning king. Ludovic is such an arrogant cliche that all he needs is a mustache to sinisterly twirl to be an outright cartoon. Lastly, there are Marina's best friends: Julius, a gay hanger-on from chilly Michigan eager to make an impression on the New York social scene, and Danielle, who is presumably the humane center for the novel to pivot on, but suffers from such ludicrous Ally McBeal-esque crises in her love life that her credibility is dangerously suspect after the first hundred pages. The characters are uniformly pretentious and are alternately mildly and seriously annoying, but Messud manages to propel her novel forward despite their intrinsic unlikability because, as shallow as they are, they are all multi-layered, complex, believable people. The many threads comprising the narrative are expertly weaved together for some compelling character studies (even if you wouldn't necessarily want to hang out with the lot of them). But that willingness to stick with their stories is, at least for me, predicated on the belief that they will be changed people by the novel's end. They aren't. And while the narrative is expertly crafted, Messud has a penchant for overusing commas in her prose that becomes, increasingly, irritating, as she uses them to stretch out her sentences, and to add separate thoughts, or descriptive elements, and even, occasionally, dialogue, so that they feel like run-ons, like this one right here, this example I've devised for you, but are, for the most part, technically, grammatically sound, even though you may have to re-read the most trying sentences a second time, just to figure out what she is saying, without letting all of her distractions get in the way.   Messud does an admirable job building suspense as the chapters go by and September 11th draws near. There is a great degree of foreshadowing to be found, some directly indicating that September will be a month of great change, what with Ludovic's magazine set to launch on the 13th and a wedding to take place, but naturally none of the characters can predict just how fateful the month will prove to be. The sense of impending disaster looms large in "The Emperor's Children," and it is quite unfortunate that the novel loses steam when tragedy actually strikes. Indeed, 9/11 is almost anticlimactic when it occurs, serving merely as a catalyst to wrap up everyone's story lines. It was unbearably annoying to endure the outrageously selfish way that the characters responded to the attacks and the gross loss of life that they witnessed. In the late afternoon of that day, after the towers had fallen and Manhattan's skyline was irrevocably altered forever there wasn't a lot of soul searching going on in the hearts and minds of these characters. All they care about are their own petty problems and how the terrorists ruined their carefully planned calendars (I felt like throwing the book across the room in disgust when Ludovic had the audacity to go on a tirade about how his precious magazine's launch had to be cancelled). I live in the tri-state area, about an hour and a half away from Ground Zero, and the events of that day and the intense mourning that followed will be with me for the rest of my life, and what Messud has critically failed to capture is the way that 9/11 actually brought a grieving city closer together for a brief moment in time, and how for once people put aside their petty complaints to work on the larger issue at hand. I remember crying at work alongside my stunned colleagues and the reassuring hugs we gave each other, the phone calls I made to -- and received from -- people I hadn't even spoken to in months or even years, just to make sure that they were all right. I remember the eagerness with which people helped each other out, whether the need was great or small. This incredible outbreak of brotherly love earned the admiration of the world, but it is conspicuously absent from Messud's telling. One character uses the tragedy for personal gain career-wise, one uses it as an excuse to wallow in self pity (not for anything to do with 9/11, mind you, but for strictly personal reasons) ... I don't want to give too much away by outlining the callous behavior that offended me so much, but in my opinion it was woefully inappropriate. I had hoped that tragedy would change the Emperor and his Children for the better, but I was wrong. And it's a shame. Messud is definitely a capable, promising writer -- but this isn't her finest hour 
 When I picked this book up, I expected it to be interesting.  As a fat kid, I thought I would enjoy the story, thinking that I would feel connected to the main character.  Boy, was I wrong.  In the beginning of the book, Troy, feeling suicidal, wants to throw himself on the tracks, but Curt, a skinny druggie, stops him.  By the middle of the book, I wish Curt had just held back and let Troy jump.  The book was very slow for me; each new chapter sounded like the last.  I read this short book over two weeks because I just couldn't take it.  The end was unsurprisingly predictable.  I mean, I could've told you what was going to happen by the fifth chapter.  Usually, when I read a book, I take something from it, maybe a lesson or a moral.  In this book, I just felt a sense of nonclosure... the ending didn't really do it for me.  Based on the other reviews on this page, you probably think that I'm just a mean person who writes scathing reviews on great books.  The first part may be true, but I only write scathing reviews on things I did not particularly like.  You may not have liked Macbeth, but I sure did.  Whether it's a good book or not is all a matter of opinion 
 I have tried just a couple of the Hacks in the beginning portion of this book (#11, #14) and nothing has worked as displayed in the book.  I have followed everything word for word, read the errata, double-checked everything over and over.  The objectives of the book are great, they just don't work in the real world 
 Having been involved in a production of a play, I was very surprised to read this edition, surprised because it seemed to lose so much of the play's poetry and excitement. By altering the text to create a rather traditional form of theater, Mr. Rudall undermines the power of the text fragments and fails to adequately provide future performers and readers with the materials to create a production. I would advise anyone interested in the play, which is at turns tragic, hysterical, and terrifying, to seek another translation 
 I have rated this book 2 stars as a message to the author. I have bought copies of both editions in c# and downloaded and tried CSLA .NET, but had to reject it for application development. My reason for rejecting it is that frameworks are supposed to save you time not increase time to market by a very steep learning curve.  I think the CSLA framework is near great - very good. The book is however an example of atrocious writing from a great software architect whose forte is probably not writing. Mr. Lhotka, does a LOT of diservice to his great framework and thereby devalues it, by writing such a poor book. Not that the book is full of errors, no! Really he or an associate of his should have written at least two books:  1. CSLA Application Developers' Guide (or some title to that effect). This book would be a 500 - 800 page book with at least a few complete examples, that demonstrate how to develop complete applications in CSLA.  2. CSLA Internals Guide (another 500 - 800 page book) that explains the CSLA framework design and code in detail and provides guidance on extending or customizing it.  Alternatively the author could have combined the contents of the proposed books 1 and 2 above into a 1200 or so page tome with close to 70% of the book spent on how to develop applications with the framework.  A third book, probably an online HTML help format one would be the reference manual.  As it stands the author does not quite help either  developers or extenders and makes the learning curve rather steep. With the quality of the framework, it would have been extremely popular.    Until the author provides better documentation a better-documented framework is available in 'Developing Application Frameworks In .NET' by Xin Chen. I would have preferred Mr. Lhotka's framework, but the the documentation is outrageously bad. Mr. Chen's much smaller book and simpler framework is much more easily understand and easier to extend 
 This book is NOT everything you need to interface your PC with outside devices.  Like most of Myke Predko's books it is full of filler material and misrepresented.  It does contain lots of interesting information about computer interfacing, but no useful information to get you started on your own.  I am very dissapointed with Predko's books and feel that he writes to sell books and not primarily to educate and inform 
 Lisa Endlich, formerly a trader with Goldman Sachs, has written a book on Goldman Sachs' history and corporate culture.  As a former employee, she, like every other former employee writing about her employer, must have been torn between loyalty to her old employee, and wanting to write a truly dispassionate history.  One or the other must give.  The one truly interesting tidbit in this book was that Goldman, the founder, refused to support the British during World War One, as did John Pierpont Morgan and almost all others, out of loyalty to his German roots.  Goldman Sachs was and is undoubtedly an extremely interesting and extremely accomplished partnership and now company; this book however, is little more than a summary of discussions held around water coolers.  If you're interviewing for a job with GS, already have a job with GS, or merely looking for a good bibliography of this history of various Wall Street firms, this book is definitely worth reading, otherwise I do not know what purpose reading this book would serve you 
 I chose this camera specifically because of the advertised in-camera red-eye reduction fix. I have a new baby and like any proud parent, take loads of photos of him. It is a pain to have to fix the red-eye manually in Photoshop, but at the same time I don't want to lug around (or learn how to use) an SLR type camera. I thought the Coolpix S9 would be the solution to my problems. While the photos are very crisp and clear, the red-eye is worse than in my old Casio digital camera and the flash really washes out indoor photos taken at night. In fact the flash is so bright it makes my son turn away from the camera, so the pictures that didn't have red-eye were all of the back of his head! I returned this camera and am renewing my search for something that will meet my needs 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I read The Last Tycoon, by F. Scott Fitzgerald, and I thought that it was really bad. All it was about was the incredibly boring life a movie producer, the affairs of the same man and his partner, and I felt that all  of the events in the book were ludicrous. Nothing like that happens in real  life. I could not stand the book 
 Williams Fosters analyzes Latino gay and lesbian movies.  He has an expansive view of the genre; he covers U.S. Latinos/as and Latin Americans.  Unfortunately, the average American viewer won't have access to all the films that he discusses.  His chapters are boring and confusing.  There was not a single chapter that I found enlightening, even though some of the movies discussed are excellent in their own right.  I am surprised that such a guru of Latino gay and Latina lesbian issues could write such a poor book.  Maybe this is an example of publish or perish.  There are so many other books and book chapters about films and their representations of gay men and lesbians of color that are better.  I highly do NOT recommend this book 
 I love Koontz but this book fell far from the mark.  It started off slow and I found myself thinking, "Where is this going?"  And, in the end, I felt it took me nowhere.  And, the T.S. Elliott quotes got a little annoying.  If you're a fan like me, I know you'll read it despite this review but if you're a first-time Koontz reader, don't start with this book.  It is definitely not his best work - try Odd Thomas or even (going way back here) The Funhouse instead 
 If you are a golfer, ignore this. It's probably a good read for ageing hippies into 60s/70s mysticism. Golf provides a backdrop but is not the main thesis. If you are looking for any insight into golf psychology look elsewhere 'cos it aint here 
 This author used a recent television appearance to promote this book as a chance to share his political views.  How "ethical" is that 
 As a Wiccan for over 20 years this book rates as the absolute worst on the market. Even the "fluffy bunny spellbooks" aren't as antiethical to what Wicca is. This man hates women as much as any Dominionist Christian and is especially full of screeds aganist women who dare to embrace Dianic Wicca. He can't stand that some women aren't dancing attention on him. There's no real love for nature and it's cycles in his books either. As others have also stated this man is contemptous of anyone who follows a different path in Wicca from him, ranting like some insane far right wing Christian that his path is the only "true" path. His conception of Wiccan spirituality is NOTHING like what any path I'm familiar with espouses (And with over 20 years as a Wiccan, I'm familar, and open to those that follow the many paths not my own.) I have many Wiccan friends who follow many difference paths and there are things we have differences of opinions on, but none as much as this ugly, manipulative path that has no resemblance to any of the many colors of Wicca. Avoid this incredibly wrongheaded book 
 Donald Richie is an extraordinary interpreter of Japanese culture.  He has translated many great modern Japanese books and I'm certain his knowledge of Japanese language is incomparable.  Unfortunately, what he most certainly is not is a legitimate film critic. The damage he does to Kurosawa in this book is unwarranted and small-minded. More than I could take. Richie's understanding of film itself is completely inadequate, forcing him to resort to literary interpretive techniques in order to make up for his misunderstanding of cinematography and the nature of film in general. At the heart of it - he is incabable of "seeing" which is the foundation of Kurosawa's work. If you like wayward, stream-of-consciousness criticism masquerading as serious film criticism you'll certainly get your fill.  But most of what Richie does in this book is lob irrelevant pot-shots at Kurosawa, his personality, "mistakes" and the overriding theme (which becomes readily apparent towards the end) that his last films were just sentimental drivel. In fact I can't think of a single film covered in this book that Richie can bear to like wholeheartedly. Not without an uncomfortable juxtaposition of his true talent (literature) and film criticism - which I found to be completely inadequate. Another gaping hole is his obvious lack of understanding of the process of filmaking, or rather the way in which this process differs from writing in meaning and structure. His tone is pompous, downbeat and arrogant. For Ritchie - Kurosawa IS the film - and that is his greatest mistake - to turn the reader's attention to the "novel" of Kurosawa. Over and over he naggingly searches (pouring over grains of sand)for a continuity in Kurosawa's work that will bring a "literary" motif to everything he has done, that is to say, every disparity that exists between one film and the next is scrutinized under the lamp of literary criticism, and summarily dismissed. I can't imagine anything more inappropriate in a work of film criticism. All in all, this book comes off as a snotty jab at a master filmaker by a master spokesman for Japanese culture who simply does not understand film. I found reading it to be a wretched experience. And I hope you will too 
 An account of modern (post-Industrial Revolution) medicine's attempts to squish women under the juggernaut of progress by declaring them weak and/or unfit to achieve. While we here at History House are always suspicious of  any work with an obvious political agenda (printed by The Feminist Press),  the accounts of doctors and their loopy practices in the nineteenth century  are a hoot. If push came to shove, we would suspect some of the wilder  accounts given are probably minority views, but the prevailing notion of  women as fragile bits of fluff subject to the whims of their productive  systems was probably held by a majority of the docs during the period in  question. Besides, it's only about ninety pages. A good bathroom read.  [HistoryHouse.com 
 Jack R. Meredith and Samuel J. Mantel, Jr. have written an academic reference book about project management that is at times dry, theoretical, and boring to read. However, their book is at other times a good, interesting reflection tool for an experienced project manager. A green project manager will often have difficulty to relate the content of the book to his/her new practice. Based on my own experience, there is ultimately no better learning school than getting his/her hands "dirty" in the field under the supervision of an experienced project manager to learn the ropes of the job 
 The listing says "Printed on waterproof, tear-resistant, permanently folded paper." In reality it is printed on flimsy stock and is not laminated. The map itself is ok, but not exceptionally detailed. Certainly not worth the price.

 I feel a bit releived after reading some of the reviews on here.  I thought I was too uncoordinated to get this down, but the left to right on this DVD is REALLY confusing. Once I get messed up, there's no getting it back.  I DO NOT recommend this for anyone who is just starting out.  It's not easy to pick up the flow.  He goes from showing you the name of the movement and how to it, to telling you to mix them all together by name.  I'm sorry, but when I am learning a movement, I can't remember what to do after only being told once.  I am paying more attention to the movements and doing them correctly than I am to the names of them! I'm just left frustrated and wondering which DVD I should start with instead 
 The things that most struck me was the book was more "attacking" than setting up positive models.  I found the language to be quite inflammatory and harsh.  This made it very unpleasant to read.  For a much better book on house-churches, try "Houses that change the world" by Wolfgang Simson 
 Warning to all those who are reading this for a school assignment: you may think that an "enriched classic" is simply the text with commentary also included. Not so, with this book. They shouldn't call it an "enriched classic". They should call it "dumbed down for lazy readers. 
 I can't even believe alkaline trio even let that be put on a cd, that is terrible 
 This book has a lot of great examples of illustration, but the layout of the book is way too confusing. I found myself often lost where I should continue to read. The intro for interface has very little help for the beginner to start this program. This book might be good reference for advanced users, but not for beginners. Maybe the author wants to make a nice-looking book, but this book is over-designed, lack of functionality . I would recommend video tutorial from Lynda.com, it's ideal for beginners who never used Corel Painter and Wacom drawing tablets 
 I think the fact that the average rating for this album is 4 stars is a bit of an inflation.  Don't get me wrong, I own all their recordings and love The Band just as much as anybody else, but this album, though it has a couple highlights, sounds mostly burnt-out and hollow, making it subpar (for ANY band) and WAY lower quality than we've come to expect from The Band.  I'll start with the negatives, since they mostly outweigh the positives, then move to the album's highlights later (please remember, I'm trying to take off the rose-colored glasses and be realistic about this album).  First off, as everyone knows, this collection of songs is, and never was, an album.  It's a collection of unreleased studio tracks strung together to fill The Band's contract.  Consequently, the songs weren't conceived as part of a cohesive whole and the album has no flow whatsoever.  Likewise, the rest of the album reflects this: a lack of attention, care, and soul.  By this point, a lot of Robbie's writing became really tired and forced--listen to "The Saga of Pepote Rouge," and "Let The Night Fall," and you'll see what I mean (spaceships?!).  There's not much inspiration, and he seems to be ineffectively trying to follow stock song blueprints that worked on their better albums.  The magic that buoyed Northern Lights - Southern Cross, making it one of their strongest records ever, is pretty much completely absent, which is a pity.  You can really tell on these songs just how bad Robertson wanted to be done with The Band and move on.  The playing is pretty similar.  The Band members go through the motions, passing around lead vocals, Garth plays a bunch of instruments (a lot of easy-listening sax this time around, not really to my taste), and Robbie contributes some pretty gnarly guitar, though it's not supported by well-written songs.  Although the songs are pleasant enough, there's not really much to get excited about, and it really sounds like the musicians aren't emotionally invested and inspired in making these songs as good as they can be.  On a final note, "Knockin' Lost John" reminds us why Robbie didn't and shouldn't have sung on almost all of the Band's releases.  Now on to the album's saving graces, since there are a few.  No matter how bland the songs and how uninspired the playing, it's still The Band doing it, which counts for something.  Even though much of their signature sound is being replaced with a more late-70's lite-pop production, it's still a bit of a pleasure to hear Rick's, Levon's and Richard's voices.  "Georgia On My Mind" is worth the price of admission all by itself.  Richard Manuel's voice was getting pretty haggard due to his hard living, but I'll be if it didn't add even more soul and texture to his always sublime vocals--I could listen to the guy sing grocery lists and probably still be entertained.  Robertson actually did write a couple decent tunes, like "Christmas Must Be Tonight" (although an arguably better version was already released as a bonus track on the superior Northern Lights - Southern Cross), and "Right As Rain" isn't too bad, though it really doesn't sound like The Band.  It's also pretty cool that Rick Danko helped out with the songwriting with "Street Walker" (Robertson always complained that he had to do all the work), even though it's not that great of a song.  Unfortunately, though, most of the album's good points are only mildly pleasant, and after it's over you get the feeling you've just listened to something with little substance that The Band cared about just as much as you probably did.  I'll probably get axed by hardcore fans for not giving it 5 stars, but seriously, it's not worth that many by anyone's standards.  If Islands deserves 5 stars, how much is Music From Big Pink worth?!  I'm glad I own it because of its highlights and because I'm a completist, but not everybody is.  Islands certainly isn't essential, but you might get some enjoyment out of it.  Just make sure you have everything else first 
 This will be less of a formal review and more of a personal take, more or less. Due to the fact I've read several intro books, as well as the primary source material, i have a well-informed frame of reference in the judgment of this book's merits.  Not long ago I said the following: Russell's A History of Western Philosophy? Patooey! The all time worst intro book i've ever read!  Granted, HWP is witty, no doubt. This is probably the book's only redeeming value, meriting it a star. Scattered throughout are gems like: "I would rather be reported by my bitterest enemy among philosophers than a friend innocent of philosophy."   On the other hand.... HWP is overrated, underwhelming, and embarrassingly inept for many reasons.  Overrated? The inadequacy and shallowness of most interpretations of the other philosophers' works is the biggest factor. Worst of all, the flippant comments are amusing, which provide entertainment in a conversation, but are utterly out of place when introducing a serious work. However, Russell's take on Leibniz is reliable, because he did his homework, occasionally.  Underwhelming? Russell, like a well trained 'whiggish', kneels deeply before the altar of John Locke, supposedly the champion of the 'modern liberal republican.' Despite admitting that Locke is an inferior philosopher to Spinoza, the godfather gets more press. Instead of philosophy in the HWP, we get self-serving propaganda.  Inept? Not once does Russell ever truly take a problem seriously. IThe complete failure to understand Kant, the philosopher of the enlightenment, as well as Schopenhauer (skipping the World as Will and Representation is not a good idea, Bertie) is a huge let-down. Predictably, he reads Nietzsche as a fascist (exposes his shoddy scholarship by linking him to Nazi socialism), whiffs on Dewey's brand of pragmatism, and for reasons unknown, devotes a chapter on Byron. More bizarre is the excessive attention paid to Catholic philosophy. I don't think the biographer Ray Monk even figured this out, either. Contemporaries like G.E. Moore gets a single mention and Wittgenstein, who he greatly respected, none.  Quite telling, Russell was shocked at the book's success - he produced it casually, intended it as a potboiler, compiled from the notes for the adult education classes he taught in the United States.  Conclusion: The shallowness, due to its intent to amuse, the odd bulk of space devoted to Christian philosophy, all combine to account for world-wide success for The History of Western Philosophy. It might be a good starter, but it also contributes to the sense that philosophy is not worth bothering with.   Alternatives: Copleston's series is lengthy, but thorough, and far superior. You can't go wrong with Durant's Story of Philosophy, although it is a bit dated. Luckily, Durant writes as well as any writer in English, making that book much more accessible to most. T. Z. Lavine's From Socrates to Sartre concentrates on much fewer big-names, but has a lively narrative that sensationalizes the content.  After you've read any one of these, then try Bryan Magee's books: Great Philosophers and Talking Philosophy where both consists of interviews with scholars. As for a contemporary account, Delacampagne's A History of Philosophy in the 20th century is a delicious read 
 I am sorry to report of my disapointment with this title.  While it does contain some interesting research, the symbols illustrated are all modernized graphics.  The use of traditional and historic depictions of the symbols would have made this work much more readable 
 I've read more than a few of Greg Bear's books but have come across no books of his that were anything like Queen of Angels.  If I didn't know better I'd say there was a bug in his word processor that removed all the punctuation.    I put this book down a dozen times an finally gave up on it.  I never could get into it becuase I like to read one story at a time... not four.  I also like sentences that are structured.  I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this but I don't recommend it at all.  It will basically frustrate the crap out of you to try and read it.  
 This is one of the most far-fetched, outrageous mysteries I've ever read.  Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist.  When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose.  His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another.  All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart.  The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies?  Come on.  Don't waste your time on this one. 
  "She's either the love of his life or the end of it" reads the tagline for "Fascination". And that right there is a big tip-off for what kind of movie to expect. It gives the entire movie away.   Patrick Doherty died in a swimming accident but the odd thing is he was an excellent swimmer, soon, 3 months to be exact his wife, Maureen (Jacqueline Bisset) is engaged to Oliver (Stuwart Wilson) to the dismay of her son Scott (Adam Garcia).   Scott soon meets his step-sister Kelly (Alice Evan) and believe it or not an attraction starts. Soon Kelly, in subtle ways, starts to manipulate Scott's mind and starts making him think his mother killed his father.   "Fascination" really wants to be a steamy sexy thriller. I can see it either as a cinemax late night movie or a WB TV series. The movie even goes as far as to have the guys walk around with open shirts to try and make us, or at least the women, think the movie is sexy. You could compare this movie to the works of Claude Chabrol, the dirty secrets of an upper-class family has always been one of Chabrol's favorite themes. But "Fascination" does not have the pleasure of being directed by Chabrol instead it is directed by Klaus Menzel. Menzel though makes the mistake of taking away all of the mystery of the film. He tries too hard to spell everything out of us. Events become too obvious and thus breaks all the suspense the movie could have created. That is a sign of Menzel's inexperience.   I mentioned that Scott and Kelly have an attraction between them knowing full well they are about to become related. "Fascination" is now starting to open a whole new can of worms for itself as now it's dealing with incest. The reason I question this move is because the movie just doesn't seem interested in exploring these people and instead wants to focus on the mystery of whether Scott's father was murdered. To bring incest in the story means that you are going to have to examine the relationship between these people. "Fascination" does not dwell on the psychological aspect of these people.   Then we have the terrible dialogue. It simply sounds phony. The scene where Scott meets Kelly is an embarrassment for the actors. The pick-up line he uses on her is corny. People don't really talk to each other this way. The movie has problem with that. Dialogue is not written in a convincing way. Even the music is wrong. It tries too hard to be alluring and sexy, like the movie itself. Menzel is hitting us over the head making sure no one walks out of this movie confused. While that is a very nice gesture on his part it really does take out all the suspense of the situation.   "Fascination" has a twist up its sleeve that is just sprung on us. I think it's a cheap shot, you may not. Nothing leading up to this secret though is really suggested.   Is "Fascination" a really bad movie? Not really. One is almost tempted to merely toss it aside as a "guilty pleasure". A movie that doesn't seem to have high ambitious but is entertaining nonetheless. Notice though I said one is "almost" tempted. That doesn't mean that I'm going to do that.    Bottom-line: Despite the pleasure of seeing Jacqueline Bisset the movie doesn't have much to offer. Director Klaus Menzel tries too hard to spell everything out for us but the movie then comes cliche and predictable. The movie carries no suspense 
 IF you are looking for a set of W.C. Fields shorts or films, DO NOT LOOK AT THIS SET. I made the mistake of buying this set and I am thoroughly unhappy with the shoddy quality of this set. I filed a complaint with the manufacturers of this set, Passport Video, and they have refused to refund me. So do not buy any of their merchandise as their "no refund" policy seems to be an across the board business practice with them. Save your money and buy a quality film like "The Bank Dick," or "It's a Gift. 
 ....to the phoney parade with plastic dolphins and old farts playing accordian music, candy floss, lets pretend we're a happy family. Im just putting in my 2 cents for crap that the radio in 2005 still plays.  Back in 1991 and 1992 we didnt have Justin Timberlake or Jennifer Lopez or Enrique Iglesias....commercialism or just garbage.  What are Republicans up to these days??....Trying to kill us with cheese tunes in between the endless barrage of advertising.... BARFFFFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! sorry I ruined your happy bubbly little world 
 Definitely not one of his best! SLOW SLOW SLOW...  But at least this character had some realistic difficulty learning a foreign language, unlike the hero of "The Partner" who learned a little known Spanish dialect perfectly by sitting in a hotel room listening to cassette tapes for 2 weeks 
 This book starts out promisingly, then degenerates into an ordinary (and rather dull) personal journal.  I am a nursing mother of a 2 month old, and was intrigued by the subject, but disappointed by the book.     I'm with the other reviewers who said that the author comes across as braggy and self-absorbed.  Slogging through repeated accounts of how fat she looked and what she wore was tedious at best.        Also, maybe I'm a dork, but I kept wondering how she would tie the title of the book in with her story.  She doesn't.  
 This book is very difficult to follow.  It isn't intended for beginners, I guess, but even novices will have trouble following the information here.  The circuits and ideas are good if all you want to do is build someone else's circuits, but if your goal is learning about microcontrollers, this one is somewhat poorly written and tough to follow.  Also, as other reviews have stated, expect MANY typographical errors 
 viewed it 1st was disappointed knodded my head in disbelief while watching,waiting,hoping!!!,the second time i tried to keep awake but could not keep my eyes open long enough, must of been those gravity waves in interstellar space out there in umm well you get the picture.My advise is for you to save your money and buy comos (the best imo)To be honest, i couldn't wait to sell it used at a $10 lose through amzn.the following week(they get a commission for sold items)nonetheless,i am content i no longer own it.Next time i will rent before purchasing on amzn. Just So you know, "cosmos" i can watch over and over for years as this was my first box set from amzn..the late carl sagans"cosmos" blows away "the astronomer" 
 I saw Robert Cray on this tour and have seen him more than 10 times.  We just him opening for Clapton last month.  Sadly, his live shows get duller every year.   He seems to be stuck playing these mid-tempo songs from his playbook that just aren't that interesting.  Phone Booth and Our Last Time are slowed down to the point where they have lost whatever charm they once possesed.  Songs such as Bouncin Back, Consequences, Picture of a Broken Heart, or Survivor would have made a much stronger playlist.  There are some bright lights on this album: I Was Warned and Time Makes Two are riveting and intense.  It is time for Cray to get some new collaborators as he and his longtime band have settled into a deep and somnambulent rut.   There are many better ways to enjoy Cray's music than this.  I strongly recommend Strong Persuader and I Was Warned as the best ways into his songbook 
 This book is infuriatingly opinionated; and Fadiman spends a lot of energy and space insulting great writers and saying stupid things. He seems more intent on placing his writers into a bogus hierarchy than actually appreciating them.  Many of his judgements are simply wrong 
 My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series.  They've been the only movies to hold his attention.  The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it.  That said, this movie never got or held his attention.  There are no interesting sounds or music.  The voices are very monotone.  While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it?  The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said.  I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures.  If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool.  All around, this move was disappointing 
 This is an album just full of bubble-gum pop songs. If you actually hear music, don't buy this. And her little shrill in Go on and Cry is horrible.  Better luck next time. If there is a next time 
 This is poetry? I know she calls it free verse or some nonsense but I don't agree that she can call this poetry. She should just call it a book of song lyrics that never made it into any songs. She could've called it a diary and it would have been fine. Poetry? I'm not so sure. Some of the poems don't make any sense. Some of them are boring. And none of them have any rhythm. I'd call this a collection of witty anecdotes or something, but not poetry. It just isn't poetry. I can't stress that enough. How does reading Bukowski give her a license to suck 
 I have no idea what these authors are trying to put across. They do spend a lot of time trying to put a scientific explanation to what an imagination is and giving the reader thier "occult expertise". The fact that one of the authors claims that astral projection is impossible to achieve at will implies that they are most likely one of Israel Regardies' "Cosmic Foo-Goos". The reader, if they take this work to heart, may come from the experience a less effectual person. It is sad that [garbage] like this gets sold and marketed when there is so much more valuable stuff out there 
 The most god awful CD I have ever listened to. I bought it randomly at a CD store, and it was a huge waste of money. I like some bands that are really messy (like Guitar Wolf), but this is just garbage. It isn't even understandable. It isn't music, it's noise. I can't believe these guys got a record deal. Don't believe anyone that says it is good. If you buy this album you will seriously regret it 
 Overall, an 'OK' read, but teaches human sexuality as though his audience was a grade-six sex education class as rather than mature-minded adults.  This book is extremely simplistic and vague, and tends to lean towards a more dellusional depiction of human sexuality, often confining it to the contexts of outmodded biblical principles and male-dominated patriarchy.  Lacking modern approach and intimate sensuality, I would sincerely hope that this book is not a reflection of poor Tim's seemingly mechanical sex life!!  I would not recommend this book unless you are totally ignorant and clueless about what sex is all about.  I would suggest looking elsewhere for a more relevant guide to sexual intimacy 
 I bought this to help change the leather strap on a beautiful watch.  The v-notched end was too thick to fit - I used my pocket knife instead.  Maybe there's a "knack" to it, but I didn't want to scratch my watch while practicing. The pointed end works very well for pressing in those tiny spring bars and the small, recessed auto-set buttons for which a ball-point tip is too big and a needle is too clumsy. But you probably have something around the house that would work just as well (mini-screwdriver, the point of a phillips head... 
 A friend of mine got me a subscription to this magazine because I like Cooks Illustrated.  This magazine is nothing but ads for snazzy expensive foods and restaurants.  There are so few recipies in it I wouldn't call it a 'cooking' magazine.  What few recipies they do have don't explain why they chose the ingredients used or give much detail at all.  If you consider yourself a 'foodie' who likes to go to fancy restaurants and likes to know what's hip on the latest gourmet food and wine, then this magazine might be for you.  If, however, you like to cook and know what you are doing and why you are doing it, try Cooks Illustrated instead. 
 This is the most misinformed intolerant religious right wing propaganda I have ever read.  The author obviously took many assumptions about paganism and stereotyped the entire group.  His arguments against it hold as little logic as he claims the pagan community uses in their own beliefs.  I would strongly recommend not purchasing this book of intolerance and social hatred 
 I bought and examined this book thoroughly. There are so many old concepts I wonder whether the author has ever re-read its current second edition. It is supposed to have been written for C++ programmers but of what generation? I understand that the current 2nd edition was written after the release of MS Visual C++ 4. So, the source code still assumes that C++ doesn't have the true and false Boolean constants since the author #defines them, which causes an error in both Visual C++ 6 and later. In fact, the use of #include <iostream.h> and void main()indicate that the book is not ANSI compliant. The web site that supports the book provides source code, for MSVC 4 (only after I bought the book, which is extremely expensive, did I find out on the 4th page that it was released in 1996; but the current C++ Standard is from 1998). I tried compiling them in MSVC6 and MSVC.NET. None of the programs compiled (none at all). Even after re-creating the programs by adding files manually, I received many many errors. I tried to fix them and also tried compiling from the Command Prompt, to no avail. It is true that we don't have that many books on compiler development but just as these books are rare, this particular one will be to no help. It is (very) old and its programs don't work. The only things you might get are the authors comments that may help you with some suggestions or guidance, which will be little 
 The boorish broad from Baltimore strikes again! What makes this book so insidious is the way that the heroine peppers her pseudo-intellectual do-goodisms with an underlying capitalist mentality. Given her background,  she should know better. Shame on you girl 
 Considering the hype, I really expected more.  ** The interview is only half the book, and the type is HUGE -- despite being a trade paperback, there are only about 80% as many words per page as with your average mass market paperback.   ** The interview was unedited, so a non-trivial portion of it consists of, e.g., Heinlein saying "What was that?  How do you spell that?" and then Schulman spelling it out.   ** The interview itself is about what you would expect from a 20-year-old with a political axe to grind. ** The rest of the book is filler, e.g., letters that Schulman wrote Heinlein, Schulman's reviews of some of Heinlein's books, etc.. ** All of the above are spiced with the expected libertarian rantings and hyperbole, e.g., Schulman's claim that anyone who thinks Heinlein was a Fascist is a Marxist. (Heinlein was NOT a fascist, but AT BEST such rejoinders show the same lack of intellectual depth and integrity displayed by some of Heinlein's critics.) In short, this is a short, expensive book that is more about Schulman than it is about Heinlein.  [... 
 This book sounded good:  An alphabetical listing of nearly all recent movie stars with a discussion of each star's worst film.  To qualify, a film had to be both a commercial and critical disaster.  Only problem is the authors appear to have written the book over a long weekend.  The entries are very short -- usually a page, sometimes less -- and contain almost no background on the films, apart from their box office take and, occasionally, quotes from reviewers.  We all know Halle Berry's a fine actress and Catwoman was a bomb.  Why not tell us how she came to make the film, what problems the film encountered in production that made it so bad, and so forth?  The authors did essentially no research that might have enabled them to discuss these issues.  Instead they provide a brief summary of the actor's career before and after the bomb under consideration and make a few smart remarks about the movie itself.  They would have to be far wittier than they are to pull this off.  In short, if you are movie fan, you probably already know everything you will read in this book.  For a much better book on the same subject, check out James Robert Parish's Fiasco 
 This is anything but a "historical inquiry" into the New Testament accounts of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is at best "historical speculation," and Lï¿½demann's conclusions are little more than assertions based on his arbitrary, atomistic textual critical methodology and anti-supernatural presuppositions.  To Lï¿½demann, development from one gospel to the next is evidence of distortion. This is apparent in his discussion of the tradition of Joseph of Arimethea. Lï¿½demann is quite troubled that each of the gospels portrays Joseph in increasingly glowing terms. Although one could interpret this development as simply the progressive inclusion of more information, Lï¿½demann arbitrarily declares these accounts suspect as a result.   Lï¿½demann also dismisses any positive reconstruction of the ending of the gospel of Mark, yet insists on a negative reconstruction of the resurrection chapters in John's gospel. He admits that Mark's gospel ends with a preposition in the Greek, yet insists that we must consider the text as it has come to us without speculating on a lost ending. Since he holds to Markan priority, he argues that the earliest tradition, therefore, records no resurrection appearances.   Yet Lï¿½demann is certain that we must not accept the received text of John chapter 20. He asserts that verse 11 does not chronologically connect with verses 1-10 and, therefore, declares verses 14-18 the imaginative insertion of the author, exhibiting a surprising bias against the nature of ancient biography and its often characteristically non-chronological nature. Furthermore, he insists that verses 19-23 contradict verses 24-28, since verses 19-23 do not mention that any of the disciples were missing when Jesus appeared to them, yet 24-28 declare that Thomas was missing. But verses 19-23 make no mention of the number of disciples present when Jesus appears. So how does the information in the succeeding passage constitute a contradiction? This is additional information, not contradictory information. Nonetheless, Lï¿½demann declares these passages unhistorical. Such arbitrary textual vivisection is characteristic of Lï¿½demann's method, and his arbitrary acceptance of Mark and rejection of John further reveal his bias.  Another example of Lï¿½demann's "historical" method appears in his discussion of the Sabbath Day meeting between the Jewish leaders and Pilate recorded in Matthew 27: 62-66. He considers the account of this meeting between "strict followers of the Jewish law" and the gentile Pilate as "incredible" and therefore historically "nil." Lï¿½demann does not tell us just which Sabbath law the Jewish leaders were breaking as a result of this meeting. Furthermore, the Sadducee's among this group had already proven themselves to be purely politically motivated. As for the Pharisee's among them, they had already been party to the arrest and condemnation of an innocent man by means of a bribe to an inside informer and an illegal trial in the middle of the night. At what point had these lawless co-conspirators suddenly become pristine law-abiders? Apparently, Lï¿½demann can easily accept that the New Testament writers had personal agendas in fabricating imaginative resurrection stories, but cannot fathom sinister chicanery among the Jewish leaders.   Finally, we come to Lï¿½demann's explanation of the resurrection appearances themselves. Leaning on the theories of modern depth psychology, Lï¿½demann psychoanalyzes the apostle Paul in order to explain his reported encounter with Christ on the road to Damascus. According to Lï¿½demann, Paul had a "Christ complex" emerging from his conflict between the alleged harshness of the Jewish law and the attractiveness of Christ's message of grace. This conflict supposedly came to a head when Paul had a purely subjective "vision" of Christ that resolved this conflict and changed his life. Furthermore, Lï¿½demann asserts that this "vision" represents the pattern of all the other recorded appearances of Jesus, although these appearances allegedly were more the result of the disciples' wishful thinking and the need to resolve their "guilt-complex" that resulted from deserting their master.    In response, we must first ask why, prior to Paul's conversion, there is no evidence in the text that he was unhappy with his life. He describes himself as one progressing in his Judaism and zealous for the Law. It appears that Paul was a quite well-adjusted, anti-Christian bigot. Secondly, we must ask what "wishes" the earlier disciples had that would have motivated such a "vision." There was no anticipation among them that their deceased Master would appear again, nor was there any place in their theology for a dead Messiah. Finally, Lï¿½demann fails to tell us how the experience of subjective visions translated into the disciples' unanimous proclamation that Jesus had risen bodily from the dead. There is no precedent in the Old Testament or Second Temple Jewish literature for such an interpretation of visions. Furthermore, Second Temple Judaism would seem to preclude such an understanding of visions, even if objective. "Resurrection" was understood by first century believing Jews to mean a physical event in space and time. So even if we grant that Paul saw a heavenly Christ, we are not compelled to believe that this was the experience of all the other disciples, nor are we compelled to believe that the Christ Paul saw was not embodied.*    In the end, Lï¿½demann's theory is based on historical and psychological speculation that find no support in the text. His is just another attempt to come up with a naturalistic explanation of the resurrection at any cost, since, to Lï¿½demann, a supernatural explanation, even if it remains the best explanation, is simply a priori unacceptable.  * For an exanded treatment of some of the thoughts in this paragraph, I recommend the book Jesus Resurrection, Fact or Figment: A Debate Between William Lane Craig and Gerd Lï¿½demann, ed. Paul Copan and Ronald K. Tacelli (Downers Grove, IL: Intervarsity Press, 2000).   
 If you're interested in comparing Christianity with Islam, keep looking! Unfortunately, the author, for all his college education seems to have forgotten much of his Islamic history. Many of the incidents cited are completely false and many others are taken grossly out of context. He uses this neglectful writing style solely to malign the Islamic religion while uplifting the Christian  religion, leaving out what's most convenient for his points. Similarily, he seems to have left out the 9th commandment which forbids bearing false witness. Very convenient Mr. Gabriel. 
 I bought it because I had heard it was a good flick! Well after watching it I gave it to my brother. Save your money 
 I loved Gilbert's "Remote Feed" and was eager to read this novel, but by pg. 140 I simply couldn't continue.  The wise-guy prose, the elaborate language describing nothing, the John Irving "Hotel New Hampshire" madness forced on the proceedings and the most bland, ridiculous characters imaginable -- it's all absurd, silly, unbelievable.  Great novels are about truth.  This novel is an empty farce.   I see a young and promising author turned vainglorious.  While acknowledging that Martin Amis has made this pose a career, I wish Gilbert would try for more 
 As to the best of my knowledge, there were two major intellectual responses to the seemingly endless and insuperable crisis which the capitalist system had got itself into after the Great Slump of 1929: Keynes`s "General Theory of Money, Interest and Employment" of 1936 and Schumpeter`s "Capitalism" which was first published in 1942. Like Marx before them, both Keynes and Schumpeter reject the "classic economists'" contention that what they called the market system wll always automatically swing back to an ideal equilibrium - expecially one that implied full employment - provided only the state kept its hands off as much as possible.   However, that is just about where their concurrence ends. While Marx sees the only solution outside the system, in its bloody overthrow and its succession by a "dictatorship of the proletariat" introducing the next evolutionary step in human history, called socialism, Keynes considered the market system as basically viable. All that was needed, according to him, was governmental involvement by which the lacking demand in times of a slump would be lifted to more agreeable levels. Schumpeter, in contrast, agrees with Marx in that capitalism's days are counted and that it is about to be replaced by socialism, even though he doesn't share Marx`s more aggressive notions: according to him, the present day capitalists need not be dealt with by the guillotine alone, they may indeed have a useful function as entrepreneurs employed by his envisaged omnipotent and omniscient super agency that will ideally plan everybody's well-being in his imagined socialist system.  What to think of the book today? First, it is hard to fathom how Schumpeter could have turned such an absolutely blind eye on the totalitarian tendencies necessarily inherent in a state that not only controlled the political field but also was quasi the monopolist employer and as such responsible for the economic side of peoples's lives as well, in particular when one considers the time when it came out: 1942! Second, it is a fine example of how wrong you can get things even if (or: because?) you know so much as Schumpeter did - maybe that is the best argument of all against the establishment of such a super agency planning everybody's life to the extent envisaged by Schumpeter. Finally, even if such an agency did not err - is it not a basic right - and half of the fun of life - to make mistakes - for oneself that is, not forcing them on others 
 I remember when Burroughs did an interview with Jerry Casale. And Casale spoke of midwestern misanthropy and the sense of shame about being a human. Well, in this diary, Burroughs gave full voice to his midwestern curmudgeon persona.   I almost croaked when I came across the following passage: "I must tell James: Please never conceal from me any nasty letters or reviews. I want the names of these creeps. The addresses, so I can put one of my curses on them. It will give me something to do. And jog a few higher-up elbows hiding behind the nameless a--holes. I will make a list and cross names off one after another. Like the new rich in St. Louis. At his daughter's coming-out party. Nobody showed. She went mad. He made a list of all the invitees who didn't show. And ruined them one after another. It gave meaning to his life. He crossed off the last name on his deathbed, gave a contented belch and died. He was a fully fulfilled evil old man."  The anti-drug-prohibition rants are tedious enough. But what's surprising is that he begrudges atheists just for being atheists. As if their mere existence was a personal insult to his non-denominational theistic yearnings: "I believe in God. Not omnipotent. He needs help now."  The cat-sentimentality is pretty icky. Burroughs ended up valuing humans only insofar as they're capable of being caretakers of cats: "If a plague should or will kill a third of the population, I can only pray that it affects not only humans but domestic animals, with special reference to dogs and cats. The picture of trillions of dispossessed cats is too horrible to be confronted. 
 There are many new stressors on today's teens, including being the first generation being reared in a completely postmodern culture. Unfortunately, the author misses this and other more subtle cultural changes that impact  today's adolescents in a big way.  I recommend Elkind's "All Grown Up  and No Place to Go" for a more thorough critique of how society shapes  and complicates the teenage years 
 Where the hell is the melody, the song? Just fragments of invention that rarely gel into a work of art. I think Wayne is playing the role of Miles, but has not controled his men in the same way. -think I'm crazy? Listen and judge. j 
 Wow, I dont belive they made it to eleven! I mean its mind blowing.They ruin my favorite songs,make bad songs even worse,and they can not sing to save there lives!There are people who like kids bops music along with kevin federlines,and paris hiltons.Do not be one of those people,my dear reader, go and buy the music by the original artist,not kids bops sorry version 
 But apparently Troy Gentry thinks that's perfectly all right. He bought a tame bear named Cubby, locked it in a pen and then shot arrows at it, all in the name of fun.  That behavoir is sickening, and I sincerely hope he gets jail time for it. Please do not support the lifestyle of an animal abuser--this was NOT hunting. THis was torture, plain and simple 
 I am in the planning stages of a new business venture. I have never written a marketing plan before and needed some insight and advice as to what tactics work and how to write the plan itself.  This book reads like a list of useful one-liner marketing tips and examples of how the author's friends have used them.  It is not a how to book on writing a marketing plan, and it does not go into much depth as far as how you might accomplish the things that he recommends.   The most annoying part of this book is that every other page contains an advertisement for you to join some 12-week commitment mailing list that the author has created.  He entices you by saying that you will receive additional tips and information for 12 weeks.    HELLO!!! McFLY!!! Didn't I just buy your book so that I could learn your marketing insights?  YES!  So then why do you make it seem like I just paid for the teaser information, and that the good stuff is behind the curtain that requires me to become a pawn in your marketing career?  My price of admission stops at the price of this book, and it should not seem like I'm only getting half of the story that I paid for! 
 read this book to fall asleep, actaully no, read the chapter on Freud's interpretation of dreams and then fall asleep. in the morning interpret your dreams! a load of mind numbingly boring, non-sesical drivel 
  Ok let me break itdown for you. The Game isn't all thatb great, infact it sucks on ice, but the only reason i am giving this game fear grade is because of the year. Really you really can't blame them that made this game. The Fact Is 2006 is one of the worst years. there just throwing all the game at your face and they arent really that great. we see about 90% of games and movies arent doing that good. so my suchest is wait to 2007 when the PS3 and the wii comes out. I Promise you that year want disoponte. So dont buy every thing in 06, wait till 07. Dont waiste your mone 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 As a work of fiction this is a fine book. Mailer is a great writer and as I don't think this was one of his finest works, it was still an enjoyable read. What I was a bit irked by was the lack of focus on what I thought was going to be the central plot of the novel - Adolf Hitler's childhood. This was a book about his father Alois mostly. It detailed Alois' childhood, relationships, work, children, retirement and death. As soon as he died there was 20 pages left in the book. Yes, you can say that we can gain some sort of insight into Adolf's life indirectly by seeing what a person his father was but this is not very complete. My expectation was that you would see sections of his father throughout his life, sections of his school friends, deep traumatic experiences and what inevitably started him down the road of politics. The ending of this book left me feeling very incomplete, almost as if there was a second volume somewhere that I forgot to purchase 
 I'll be honest, the last three novels have me thinking that Patricia Cornwell has sold off the franchise of her name- the "voice" the writer uses bears no similarity to her other novels, and its very frustrating. Leaves a dedicated reader feeling like she'd been attacked by the pod people or something!  I hold firm to the idea that she hasn't been writing these novels. There is just no way 
 As much as I want to, I cannot finish this book, I'm bored.  It is one part history, three parts personality expose.  The friendship angle is just not very compelling.  It reads like People Magazine meets Hitler.  It's going on the bookshelf half-read for now.  Read Manchester's The Last Lion biographies if you want a good summation of Churchill with a lot of personality thrown in for good measur 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 I love nikki turner and expected more from this book. It should have been have price since it only offered half of a story.  The end came with no conclusion and it never fully developed the characters enough to care about what was going to happen. I'm willing to give part 2 a second chance maybe nikki turner can write it and leave Fifty Cent out of it. 
 This book is terrible!!! I was forced to read this book for summer reading and definitley did not enjoy it, dont waste the 14 bucks to buy this piece of junk. I really hated this it is boring!!! Wallace puts too much useless info into the 576 pages of this hunk of crap. The first sentance is about two pages long and he often switches between 3rd and 2nd person, it is really annoying. Dont wate your life reading this book try reading "My name is asher LEv" by Chaim Potok It is truly an inspiring novel unlike this boring book. Wow i hate this book i truly hate it with every square inch of my body! I promise dont waste ur time reading this boo 
 very hard to read, very expensive for what it is. I buy this book for a course of telecommunication, and i dont use it because it is really bad! I sold this book right after i finish the course 
 I won't go into a long diatribe. Suffice it to say that when I listened to this upon its release earlier this year, I was disappointed. I gave it a few more close listens and find that the musical quality is not great. This is more a photo of dylan as a free-spirit. There's a point where baez messes up a song. (i don't have anything against baez. that being said, i don't have much FOR her either.) There's joking and laughing, but really, I don't need a double-disk of acoustic material that seems to be performed by someone who sounds like he'd rather be in the audience than performing. You can almost sense WHY dylan went electric in this concert.  The bootlegs prior to this are superior and I would suggest that if you aren't a die-hard dylan fan to stick with them. If you really like dylan's acoustic work and not his electric stuff, you should be pleased with this double-disc.  I love dylan, but not enough to enjoy this over and over again. I'll go to disk one of the 4th bootleg for my acoustic fix 
 Flash 5 for Dummies provides a good introduction for people who are not familliar with a program. Personally I find the books too basic, allowing one to get started, but not learn anything further than the basics. I suggest the Flash 5 for Windows and Macintosh: Visual QuickStart Guide as a better, smarter alternative for someone who wants to learn more than the basics 
 i sir still did not received any    Fancy Food and Culinary Products magazine 
 My problem with Rebel Angels is mostly the incredible unlikeability of the main characters. Gemma comes across as incredibly stupid, or just someone who will easily cave if you apply a little peer pressure. She continues to make stupid decisions, just because her friends whine and complain or give her dirty looks. It's like the cheesy horror films where the whole audience is yelling "Don't go in there!" and the ditsy heroine does just that. Also, Gemma is just TOO realistic as a young lady of the Victorian era. Although maybe not as much as her friends, she is still preoccupied with being among the upper class and having a good reputation. She shows nearly no compassion to the unfortunate people she comes across. This especially bothered me when she met Nell Hawkins. At the end of the book, Gemma's character improves, but by then it was too late to salvage what I thought of the book.  The only character I liked at all was Kartik. He was the only relatable character in the entire book. And he was barely included in the story at all. Gemma treated him horribly, even when she didn't mean to. The closure concerning Gemma and Kartik was also horribly done.   Also, the plot was terribly predictable. The only reason I kept reading was for the rushed descriptions of the scenery of the realms. And the hope that Kartik would make a spectacular entrance and sweep Gemma off her feet.  Overall, it was a poorly done follow-up. And that's saying something considering that I didn't like A Great and Terrible Beauty either 
 This might make a good book for your teenage kid trying to learn about small business but other than that I dont think it would be helpful.  If you really want the details of how to create and grow a real business (especialy high tech) and get funded, you should read "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs"  (Stathis).  It makes this book looks like preschool. 
 Far to difficult to pop, product didn't match picture.  But the company was very friendly and co-operative in the return process.  Would do business with this company again, but would buy one item as a test before buying in bulk.  Or I would just call the company 
 If you know absolutely nothing about professional services marketing and work for a small, local accounting firm, then this book may interest you.  Gives a very general understanding of marketing concepts but not enough to really help you do anything. If you work for a Big 5, don't waste your time with this book 
 The publisher deserves credit for putting together an attractive little book.  The short quotes sprinkled through out are pithy and to the point, while the decorative illustrations are pretty.  Those illustrations, however are the flowery type you find in Asian poetry books and have little to do with Wabi Sabi.  Gold's exposition on the subject is simplistic to the point of being juvenile. Wabi Sabi is a complex topic and requires more depth.  While new to the subject, I have already found two better books.  Lennox Tierney includes photographs of items which actually illustrate the principles of Wabi Sabi in Wabi Sabi A New Look at Japanese Design. Wabi  Sabi for Artists, Designers, Poets & Philosophers by Leonard Koren Porvides a better foundation for understanding than Gold's book 
 I bought one of these cameras because it was cheap, and Kodak has a pretty good reputation.  However, I found that the quality of the pictures it takes is rather low, and it consumes batteries very quickly.  It doesn't zoom, so unless you're close to something, it won't take a very good picture.  Once the picture is scanned onto the computer, or printed, it's very grainy and pixellated. You can get other brands for a similar price that are much better quality 
 All Sleep MD is, is Melatonin with a bunch of other herbs that do nothing mixed in. You can get Melatonin at any grocery or drug store at a fraction of the cost. Melatonin is a wonderful sleep aid, but you don't need to spend a bunch of money or take additional herbs to benefit from it! Sleep MD is a total rip off 
 This book flows along nicely but never actually goes anywhere. The book simply ends with no action, and no questions answered. It left me very very annoyed 
 Clogged with technical jargon and stilted writing, an admirable aping of early Tom Clancy.  The story is a little too far-fetched, which could have been overlooked if the language in the book wasn't so clunky.  More like a screenplay than a novel.  Nice try, though 
 I just recently bought this and when I installed it Norton caught 2 viruses on the install CD. 
 Joe Carpenter lost his wife and two daughters when the plane they were traveling in crashed. A year later Joe is still grieving, he quit his job, sold his house and is thinking of suicide.  He visits the graves of his wife and daughters to find a woman taking pictures of the graves. He wants to know what she is doing, she says she was on the plane and survived. Men start shooting at her and then start following Joe. He wonders how anyone could have survived the crash.  Joe goes back to visit some of the people who lost love ones in the crash. The greiving family members are happy now that a woman named Rose has visited them. Joe can't figure why they would be so happy. Then the family members start commiting suicide.   Joe decides to go back to the place where is plane crashed since he has not been able to face it before now. He meets a family at a ranch near the crash site. They tell him a woman and small girl visited them the night of the crash and her name was Rose, and she had a small girl with her named Nina. The same name and description of Joe's youngest dead daughter. Could Rose and his daughter be the sole survivors of the crash?  Joe finally meets Rose and she tells him that his daughter is alive, then she tells him the story behind her surviving.  Enter the twilight zone!!!!    I thought that this was one of the worst books that I have ever read. I started to quit reading so many times, but I figured the story would get better. But instead of better with a ray of hope, it got weird, unbelievable, and down right dumb.  The story could have been so much better with a different ending. Most of the things Rose talked about were so out there you had to be a scientist to even comprehend them.  First the book was sad, depressing, hopeful, then weird.  This is the first book of Dean Koontz I have read, I know a lot of people like his books, but I will not read another one. 
 It is amazing that a writer with the skill to craft Hyperion, after that crafts a book like Ilium and Olympus.  The good thing about Ilium and Olympus is the amount of ideas mr. Simmons has in his story. Combining Homer's Iliad with literary robots from Jupiter and 'Gods' on Mars' Olympos that use quantum and nanotechnology, what could be cooler? Even in his worst books Simmons has more ideas, literature and vivid imagination than most average science fiction writers have in their life.   However, the execution of this book is plain horrific, especially with Hyperion in my mind, that that in my opinion is one of the best science fiction books ever written. The biggest problem in my regard is the lack of motive. Characters in the book just have no motive to do the things they do.   * Spoiler alert *  Some examples of events for which no motives is given.  - Professor Hockenberry stays with the Greek troops while they are loosing, he can be hit and die every minute, they don't like him or accept him and he can choose to teleport and have sex with the most beautiful woman of earth. Why did he want to stay?  - Why did Prospero send Harman on a senseless thousands mile walk when his race badly needed him. Just for the submarine, after which he almost died and about which he could do nothing?  - Why did the evil monsters with almost eternal power that even could wreck the whole solar system just go away, even without putting up a fight. "Because it was rumored that the silent one was comming"? Give me a break.  - Why was Ilium transported to the future?  - Why was Moira revived and why did she ever went to sleep anyway? She could virtually live forever with the hospitums and she didn't need a body anyway. Again no reason.  - Why did Setebos remove all humans from the old earth and put them in a tachyon beam in current earth?  - Why, after aeons of their lifestiles do Harman and Ada want to start a family and suddenly have current day ethics?  - Why would robots be programmed to love poetry and need centuries for studying only one writer.   * End Spoiler Alert *  Besides not having motives the characters are very shallow. You have no idea what goes on in the mind of the Gods or in the heroes like Achilles. They never feel fear, nor are enthusiastic about anything. They just do stuff because they do or because it is written by Homer. All the Gods act the same, all the "ancient" people act the same, all the "new" people except for a mild variation Harman act the same.   Furthermore, there is no real danger. Mr. Simmons fell into the trap of putting lead characters in infinite danger, but always be saved in the last second. Yuck.   Then there is the issue of style. To make future beings probable they talk this pseudo-science all the time. Sentences are filled with "nano", "quantum", "brane" so much that it is clear that mr. Simmons tries to show off that he knows something about these scientific concepts. While I have the feeling he doesn't, really. Furthermore, these beings communicate with others of which they know they cannot know anything about these concepts, but just keep on talking the same way. And all characters do that. Plain ridiculous.   Also the literary reference, Simmon's trademark, is done really badly here. The references (mostly Shakespeare) go nowhere, he even throws in a mediocre poem of his wife. It all seems very forced and totally irrelevant. What a shame.  And don't let me even start on the anti-Islam and anti-gay references that come out of nowhere. Why?!?  To conclude, I really cannot recommend this book. If you just want to be shortly amused and don't care about quality you can read it. If you want to read some good science fiction I'd recommend to read Hyperion and possibly Endymion from the same writer. Those are terrific, great, splendid. The Ilium / Olympos is unworthy to be even in those books' shadow.  Please, PLEASE, mr. Simmons, start writing high quality Science Fiction again 
 I thought the movie was very bad.. it has nothing to do with Demons the first two..it is just full of nothing and a monster or OGre in a basement..  don't expect nothing much..it is a very bad movi 
 this has got to be one of the WORST, most unrealistic movies to date. i never have high expectations for lesbian flicks--rarely are they done well. this one, however, takes it to a whole new level. what was courtney love thinking?!  you'll regret wasting your money on this. i can't even fathom why it's gotten decent reviews so far 
 I payed for the new book; but the product that Amazon sent to me was not good because it looked like the used one without the American Hotel & lodging scantron. Usually, this scantron should come with the new book. I have called to customer service, however, nothing's going on 
 I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one 
 Jan Tomasz Gross' book "Neighbors:  the Destruction of  the Jewish Community in Jedwabne" was first published in Poland in early 2000 (under the Polish title `Sasiedzi: Historia Zaglady Zydowskiego Miasteczka'), and appeared in 2001 in American (English-language) and German editions.  `Neighbors' describes how a massacre of a number believed to be 1,600 Jews on July 10, 1941, in the village of Jedwabne near Lomza in northeastern Poland, which had hitherto been generally believed to be carried out by the German military, was actually carried out with Polish participation - according to Gross' account, it was organized and carried out by Poles, with German acquiescence.  The accusation that Poles were responsible for the Jedwabne massacre had an enormous impact on Polish public opinion.  A Polish governmental commission, the Institute of National Memory (Instytut Pamieci Narodowej, IPN) was charged with conducting a detailed investigation. IPN's findings were detailed in a 1500 page, two-volume study entitled `Wokol Jedwabnego' which unfortunately is presently available only in Polish. IPN's findings were made public on July 9th, 2002.    Gross' account in `Neighbors' is now known to be true in part, and in part inaccurate.  The fly-leaf of the hardcover edition of `Neighbors' summarizes the story as follows: `One summer day in 1941, half of the Polish town of Jedwabne murdered the other half - 1,600 men, women and children - all but seven of the town's Jews.'  According to IPN's investigation, this statement is inaccurate.   (1)   "1,600 (Jewish) men, women and children" were murdered (this statement in Gross' `Neighbors' has been repeated many times).  In fact, Jedwabne in 1941 did not have 1,600 Jewish inhabitants. An IPN historian, Jan Jerzy Milewski, found a 1940 Soviet NKVD document in the archive in Grodno showing that in Jedwabne in 1940 there were about 560 Jews.  Thus a year before the massacre, a Soviet census found the Jewish population of Jedwabne to be approximately one-third the number given by Jan T. Gross in `Neighbors'.  IPN's exhumation of the Jedwabne victims was interrupted at the request of the invited supervising Jewish rabbi that the remains of the victims not be further disturbed.  The best estimate of IPN's chief forensic investigator, Prof. Andrzej Kola, was that there were between 300 and 400 victims.  IPN concluded: `The figure of 1,600 victims or so seems highly unlikely, and it was not confirmed in the course of the investigation.'  (2)  `The Germans' direct participation in the mass murder.....was limited, pretty much, to their taking pictures' (Gross, `Neighbors'). This is false. In reality, IPN found, the day began "with the herding of Poles to the town square, which was done, according to witnesses, jointly by the German gendarmes, i.e. policemen and the people from the collaborating administration. In the testimonials there is mention of the fact that German policemen hit some of the Jedwabne Poles in the face with rifle butts or their hands, which is evidence that some of them did not want to go to the town square." The Germans then distributed bats and clubs to the Poles, to use as weapons against the Jews.  At the Jedwabne town square, the Germans were in charge.  The Germans were not in Jedwabne just as photographers, as Gross would have readers believe.  The Germans were in Jedwabne as organizers.  (3) "Half of the Polish town" murdered the other half: This is not accurate.  IPN, after interviewing 98 persons of whom about one-third were first-hand witnesses, concluded that "approximately at least forty men" were Polish perpetrators in the murder (but not "one half of the town" as stated on the fly-leaf of `Neighbors', which would have required over one thousand participants; Gross himself, in `Neighbors,' claims to have ninety-two names of Polish participants). Whether ninety-two according to Gross or "at least forty" in IPN's findings, the number of Polish participants in the Jedwabne massacre was not one-half of the village, but closer to one-twentieth.  An ACCURATE English-language version of IPN's principal findings, about 3 pages long, can be found on the Internet by going to `The Jedwabne Tragedy' at Buffalo University's `info-Poland' website, and then to `Jedwabne, July 10th, 1941: an interview with Prof. Pawel Machcewicz.'  Gross' book "Neighbors' was spectacularly successful in provoking an intensive two-year debate in Poland on the subject of Polish-Jewish relations.  An excellent collection of papers from that debate, in English translation, has been published under the title `The Neighbors Respond' edited by Joanna Michlic and Professor Antony Polonsky of Brandeis University.  `The Neighbors Respond' is not a rebuttal to `Neighbors', but examines the subject from many viewpoints. Those who want to better understand the subject, including what anti-Semitism was, and was not, in Poland, will learn far more - and in far greater depth - from `The Neighbors Respond'  than from reading `Neighbors' alone.  The greatest shortcoming of `Neighbors' is its inadequate treatment of events leading up to the 1941 Jedwabne massacre.  Gross never tells readers of `Neighbors' the most important thing which happened during the 1939 - 1941 Russian occupation of eastern Poland: the four massive deportations, from February 1940 to June 1941 (see Jan T. Gross, `Revolution from Abroad,' 2002 edition, pages 194-222, 262).  These deportations were atrocities, with women and children "packed in a standing position in sealed, windowless, and unheated cattle-wagons, for a winter journey of three, four, five or even six thousand miles.......instances of derangement, frostbite, starvation, infanticide and even cannibalism occurred."   (Norman Davies, `God's Playground,' Vol. 2, pages 448-449).    In Jedwabne, the deportation round-ups in June 1941, only a few weeks before the massacre, are described by IPN: "(Soviet) NKVD agents in groups of three, accompanied by members of the local militia, came looking for families of persons arrested or persons who had gone into hiding.  Jewish militia volunteers escorted the deportees, so they - in the eyes of many local Poles - were to blame for everything."   Many Jews in eastern (not in central) Poland, collaborated with the Russian occupation.  In many places, Jews welcomed Russian invaders.  Jewish-Soviet collaboration embittered Polish-Jewish relations during World War II and its aftermath.  
 I must admit I was skeptical when I first opened this book based on previous knowledge I had of MPD.  This book made me that much more skeptical.  In most cases of MPD or DID as it is now more commonly referred to the problem arises through the suggestive power of the therapist.  This case is different though.  On page 67 of the paperback copy I got, Ms Chase describes Stanley(her name for Phillips) as wondering how it is that the personalities could seemingly communicate with each other while at the same time not being aware of each other.  Her answer that she or as she claims her "troops" give is that it is through the use of "thought transference" which was known to the ancient Greeks as she tells us later on.  I almost burst out laughing when I read that.  She also contradicts her claim that the alters don't know of each other later when she has one of them discussing the alters Rabbit and Sister Mary Catherine at the same time.  Another way this happens is how they often refer to themselves as 'we'.  Many of the alters sound as though they came from books or movies.  The abuse that she claims occurred while living with her stepfather is rather graphic.  Her claims really belong in the same realm as those who claim past life memories, ufo sightings, satanic ritual abuse, and second sight.  I think she is not credible in the least.  There is not one fact given to support her claims of past abuse and it would be interesting for someone to write a book looking into her claims to see if there is anything that would substantiate them.  She does let us know in the book that she is very creative, artistic, intelligent, and apparently well read.  I think this has a lot to do with her claims of multiple personalities.  The book itself is long, boring, anti-climatic even with the final confrontation with the stepfather which occurs at the end.  She also seems to be claiming in the book some pscyhic abilities.  Don't waste your money on this book, unless you have to read it for a class as I did.  
 ok, First off everyone knows this is a great movie, but considering how many times it has been re-packaged for DVD over the last 5 years, you know they will be doing the ol' double dip trick again now that it's come to Blu-Ray. This is the first (Blu-ray) release and, yes, a great price from amazon for sure. I'd wait for the unrated extended (152min) cut that's available now for cheap on DVD. Be warned if u buy this one, more versions will come 
 This is not a book for believers.  Anyone of the Jewish, Christian or Muslim faith should not pick up this book because you will be seriously offended.  Mr. Kirsh takes several Biblical passages out of context to use  in his argument. His attitude towards anyone who believes is devoutly  religious and believes strongly in the words of the Bible is extreemly  condeceding.  He says "If you read the Bible with open eyes and an  open mind".  Therefore presuposing anyone who does not see things his  way is narrow minded. It was not until I got trough the first 30 or so  pages did I realise that none of the "rave reviews" he received  were from any clergy or religious orders.  Further I realised that Mr.  Kirsch views are not stated out in the open.  You don't see his perjorative  view towards the Bible, Moses and God until AFTER you've got into reading  the book.  I would only recomend this book to aetheists and others who are  contemptuous of the Bible and the above faiths 
 It's a sad thing to find an author you've enjoyed for so long produce work you really don't like much.  Feist's novels in the Riftwar and Empire (with Janny Wurts) series remain some of my favourite fantasy works, and I've enjoyed most of his other titles also.  Talon of the Silver Hawk was okay, though somewhat contrived and artificial in the way it brought about its resolution. King of Foxes has the same problems, only more so. It seems hurriedly, even carelessly put together; I never really felt a great sense of reality from any of the characters, and the plot did not move forward so much as it was pulled uncomfortably by authorial intrusion.  At the height of his powers, Feist can provide excitement, entartainment, and engaging characters as can few others.  Foxes is nowhere near that height 
 While I find it exciting to see the possibilities of this new frontier in art, I was disappointed with this book. It is packed with techniques that require expensive printers, hard-to-find art products and the use of outside service bureaus. Even with my experience in printmaking, painting and Photoshop, there is little here of practical benefit to my own collage and mixed media art 
 Zahlan covers the history of the Gulf states with special emphasis on the history of the various monarchical families. Sadly, her attitude is unflinchingly fawning; she seems afraid to say one negative thing about  these countries and their economic and political challenges. As well, the  writing style is very dry and wooden. Her bias is symbolized by one of the  maps showing the UAE as extending westward all the way to Dawhat as Salwa,  at the southwest base of Qatar. This reflects absurdly ambitious  territorial claims of the UAE at a time when the Saudis have claimed the  coast in the vicinity of Khawr Duwayhin, southeast of Qatar. This map is  emblematic of the book's flaws. A much better book despite its age (1980)  is 'Arabia, the Gulf, & the West' by J.B. Kelly 
 Beware! This thing, even if you try to be careful to be light on the pressure, as well as not keep it in one spot, it took the top layer of skin off! My poor legs were in pain from my jeans rubbing up against them at work. Ow! I had to wrap them up in long cloth bandages till the skin healed. And what's worse, it didn't take out all the hair.... I could still see some hair here and there it missed, and I thought I got it all. I returned it immediately and got a refund on my money. Never again.... I'll stick to my good ol' electric razor instead.... 
 The absurdly obvious title should be enough to tell you: this book is painful.  From the outset, the characters are all completely stock, thus assuming the reader already knows who they are, thereby releiving the author of developing them significantly.  In keeping with this bland characters, their problems seem to be little more than dopey whinning and fail to be anything more than annoying.  The plot is VERY predictable and I found I was just waiting for the expected outcomes to run their course: Devlin's self-absorbtion does him in, Max's inner goodness helps him adapt to the situation, Zeffy and Tia are set up to become big stars after overcoming self-doubt, the mother becomes more confident with the help of a new lover and the teenage daughter meanders through standard teenager problems before spontaniously deciding to grow up at the end.  Don't feel like I've blown the ending- its obvious from the get go.  I admit this is the only De Lint novel I've ever read, but I don't feel like reading another 
 I got this book as a gift and i think after reading it" only if it was that easy to forget about your pain!" I think the book tells us the strong link between the mind and pain but doesn't offer anything new when it comes to solving the problem of pain through exercises which 99% of todays experts say is the best solution to back or neck pain. Invest in an updated book that tells you how to exercise anywhere 
 I'm not sure what all the hype is about. He may have been the funniest comedian ever up through his generation, but he certainly is not any more. I can't remember laughing outloud once during this DVD. Again, I'm sure age difference plays a part. People dropping F-bombs and being raunchy in comedy isn't new or outrageous to me, it's in everything I watch. I don't want to take anything away from Richard Pryor, he paved the way and inspired alot of the people that I "DO" enjoy. But I didn't find this funny. If you want something truely hilarious, check out Dave Chapelle's "For What It's Worth".  
 My tape cassette reads, "Updated for the 90's." Well, on this tape you will learn tired, worn closing lines that were old far before the 90's. My advice, get your hands on a book called THE ACCIDENTAL SALESMAN by Chris Lyttle. He also has a audio sales training products on this website 
 This is certainly the WORST movie that Elvis had anything to do with, unless you count the final televised which can be just as disturbing and difficult to watch at this "ATOMIC" bomb. I enjoyed SEEING the sweet little Anissa Jones, John Carradine, Dabney Coleman, and Vincent Price, but beyond that this movie is absolutely unbearable. Please avoid even VIEWING it. Bottom of the trash can, literally 
 This book was full of stories of women who struggled with common friendship troubles and hints about how to help yourself if you are in a position in which you don't have enough friends due to a life change.  However, if you are reading it because you don't have very many friends and hope to learn ways to change that, a few hints aren't really going to be too terribly helpful.   If you recently became a stay at home mom and hadn't thought of trying to meet your neighbors, this book will be useful to you.  If you don't have friends because you are shy, don't know how to be friends with women, or one of the other multitudes of reasons why you might not have enough friends, this book won't help much, but you will be armed with new reasons why it is bad to not have friends.  
 After seeing the first Resident Evil movie and liking it, I was expecting a whole lot more from this film, which I had been anticipating as soon as I found out they were going to make a sequel. Unfortunately, RE Apocalypse doesn't have any of the things that made the first one good! Resident Evil was first and foremost a horror movie, with zombies and other creatures and a bit of a sci-fi touch, a lot of story going on and a great addition to the mythos of the game, with a plot that tied in neatly and nicely provided more fictional background for the RE world. The make-up and special effects were top-notch, and all of the actors, including the ones with minor roles, did a fantastic job.  RE Apocalypse accomplishes none of these things. If you're expecting a horror movie, what you get is a weird combination of the Kung-Fu and action genres. There's no character development, the plot is shallow and even Mila dropped the ball with her acting in this one.  I found the movie to be extremely boring and run-of-the-mill, and was also sad to see what they did to a franchise that could have been great if they'd improved upon the first movie's many strengths and taken out just some of its weaknesses.  In short, this movie was a complete waste of time and has thoroughly discouraged me from seeing the third one, which is set to be released next year. Somebody would literally have to pay me to see it!  
 Sounds up to date, and I bought it thinking it new, but tired forecasts from 1990 can easily be beaten by anyone of average thinking from the vantagepoint of 2000. Avoid and think for yourself instead 
 I purchased two units--one for our home and one for our vacation home.  Within a few days, the unit at home was no longer making good crema.  The water pump at the one at our vacation home died within about 10 uses.  I'm sending both units back and buying another brand.  If they had worked properly, I'm not sure I would have like them even then.  The design of this unit is "odd".  I've had home espresso machines for 12 years and this one is just weird.  If you remove the espresso coffee holder too soon after you brew, the grounds and steam explode all over.  I also suspect that the thermostat is broken.  It allows the water to boil--which does not make tasty coffee.  Overall, I hate this unit.  I'm going back to shopping 
 I found this book to be a vaguely interesting dissertation on what the SHAM (Self-Help Actualization Motivational) Movement is, and maybe even on why it is, but no help whatsoever in giving me any tools for argument against it.  I thought, sucked in by the interesting cover suggesting brain-washing in such a humorous way, that the author might have a sense of humor herself and I'd find her book absorbing intellectually and on other levels as well.  I would read a page or a paragraph or two, close the book, and nod off.  This is such a fascinating area, it could be the basis for a really fascinating book, but "Self-Help, Inc..." left me feeling I needed to go to a self-help group to deal with the density of the verbage.  It would not appeal most to the people most in need of reading it  -  the victims of SHAM 
 I first encountered the words of Wayne Dyer 5 or so years ago on PBS. I liked what I heard. Though nothing he says is original, I did like the way he presented it.  The first book of his I read was "There's A Spiritual Solution to Every Problem", the book on which the first lecture I watch on PBS was based.  I was inspired by, and enjoyed that book. As I did the next two or three. But recently, and especially with this latest volume, he simply repackages his older books in a different form. Ironic for a book about inspiration.  I want to be clear that I have no intrinsic problem with some of the concepts he talks about. But this book, and his lectures, and overall attitude lately, as opposed to my first exposure to him, are becoming quite the turn off.  In this volume, there were somevery glaring examples of either contradiction, strict unfairness, and at times, ego...despite Dyer's commitment against the ego.  I also found it very repetative, but I realize he warns of that early on. However just because something is acknowledged, does not mean it should be accepted.  The following items bothered me the most, and I would be interested to learn if others readers agree with these bothersome items.  -The oft mentioned assumption that he is personally the reincarnated spirit of St. Francis of Asissi.  -He is not very supportive of his friends. To him it seems that to even be in the presence of an unhappy person insults him. His reason being that since life is perfect and nothing wrong EVER happens to us, being unhappy or scared of something is simply a low energy, and one thathe is unwilling to stand inthe presence of. He even mentions a story of a good friend of his who started to be worried about the leaness of his business. He had legitimate concerns about going under. Not thoughts of evil or suicide or anything, just some natural worry when the finances did not look good.  Dyer, in the book, tells us "just about the time I was no longer willing to be exposed to this sort of thing..." Meaning that in his perfect life, there are no accidents, and so, he did not want to be around his supposed friend, because being a little scared or worried is ungodlike. He ignores the fact that in order to help people, especially friends, you have to be in the midst of bad things sometimes. He often quotes Mother Teresa. Yet if shehad told all of those sick people to simply "think about what you were doing when you first became sick, and stop doing it!" she would not bethe saintwe recognize her as today.  -Secondly, multiple times in just about every chapter, he plugged one or more of his other books, books by colleagues, or books published by Hay House. It is allright to acknowledge your previous works, or those of others, but the frequency with which he does so in thisvolume is disingenuous at best. Product placement, at worst.  -I call one's attention to page 106 of the book. Dyer's "12 Step Program to Simplicity." Items 10 and 11.  Item 10 calls for us to "Eschew Debt" and to live within our means...not purchases or buying things we do not absolutley need, in order to live the life we agreed with God to havebefore we were born.  The very next item, number 11, instructs us to "forget about cash value." He proceeds, on the very same page, to tell us that we should not look at the dollar signs when we are "inspired" to do something like take a trip, eat a nice dinner out on the town, or be comfortable. How can one eschew debt, and yet ignore the dollar value of an item they are inspired to posess?  -Pages 110-113. The Ram Dass Story. This is among the more insulting parts of the book. He tells the story of one ofhis mentors, and reproduces a letter he has posted on his (Dyer) own website. In it, Dyer tells of how gentle and wonderful Dass hasbeen, and how important this "dear friend" has been throughouthis life, especially since coming to live in Maui in the twilight of his life.  Then, Dyer has the audacity to solicit you and I for money to help buy Dass his own house! In Maui!  This book "eschewing" the ideaof possesions, money, and doubting that the universe will take care of everything you ever could want, is asking us to pay for his mentor's housing conditions, simply because Dyer thinks he is "a wonderful man".  How about this...Dyer isso fond of "giving something of yourself everyday..." how about cutting into your millions of dollars and cutting a check for your hero to own his own house? You can afford it, I cannot. Or if you cannot swallow that, cut him a check large enough to coverhis moving expenses out of Maui (one of the most expensive places on earth to live), and to a location far more affordable. If what is said about Dass is true, he should be happy anywhere he can find to live. They arrogance of a millionaire asking for donations to save his "mentor" who lives just down the street from him was nearly enough to get me to stop reading the book right there.  Furthermore, the entire business bore little relevence to the rest of the chapter, which was ostensibly about "Faith Banishes all doubt".  Unless you can sucker the general public into buying your guru a home in Maui.  -The name dropping throughout the book. He studied with, worked with, talked to, helped the luggage problems of...fill in the blank with celebrity X. The encounter with Renee Zellwegger outlined on pages 144-146 (complete with photo copy of a note she gave him) is the most glaring example of this.   -His mentioning more of the great things he did "in spirit", such as throwing away a mashed up burger he saw on the floor of a McDonald's, page 150 or so. I love how picking up a burger being trampled is heroic, but heneeds ourhelp in paying for his guru's home....      My point is made. There are other things, but honstly, I do not feel like looking for the page number, as I would have to skim the book again.  I am finding Dyer to be more annoying as time goes on. By his own advice about annoying people, I should send himthoughts of love. I would do so, in proportion to how much this book annoyed me, but I also have a day job.   
 I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product. It is made for smaller busted women in mind. There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman. It was a trial on my part but I hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake. Stick with the strapless bras ladies! 
 For starters, this book seems fairly substantial...until you open it.  I laughed out loud when I saw that the only reason it is 276 pages is because it is triple spaced throughout with big gaps between paragraphs.  If it was printed like most any book you see, it wouldn't be 100 pages long.  The arguments are among the weakest I've ever seen.    For example, chapter 4 provides a chronology of scientific thought from Einstein to the 1970's on the question of whether the universe is expanding or not.  The authors point out that many scientists, including Einstein, resisted the idea of the universe having a beginning because a begining implies the existence of a beginner.  Obviously this is silly (and patently false) since scientists don't ask the question, "Does this imply a god?" when formulating hypotheses and conducting experiments.  They consider only facts that can be tested and proven.    Ultimately of course, everyone accepted the idea of an expanding universe as a scientific fact and the authers cite that as evidence God exists.  (Which is ironic since fundamentalist christians were among the last to accept the idea of the big bang and the most fundamentalist still do not accept it.)    Perhaps that is the case yet there is no evidence of a creator in that line of thinking.  Essentially, the authors are assuming that where no explanation exists, there can only be one answer: God and not just any God but their God.  It is interesting to me that there are so few books on this topic.  After reading the pathetic arguments contained in this one I think I understand why 
 Well I think that this book was not the book I was looking for, it starts out well and very descriptive, but as you go on into the book it gets worse and worse, chapter by chapter. I personaly will probably never read another Jack London book because this one was so borring 
 Amazon is selling this CD for .93 cents, but don't waste your money on it. For .93 cents I could buy a postage stamp and a piece of Bazooka Joe gum. This is nothing but karaoke music and you're way better off just downloading the songs from the original artists. And Leah Labelle should have been 2nd runner up on American Idol. She had charisma, style, and a voice. I'm waiting for her album to drop. So skip this and wait for Leah's album to come out 
 Reminds me of one of those baseball books with statistics but not much else.  The stories are short and typically discuss one or two hands at most.  If you want history it may have value but it will not improve your play 
 The book concentrates mainly on the chemical breakdown of various common essential oils, and does not go into any kind of depth on the use of oils.  It does not address the title:  Healing with Essential Oils.  I found it useless and returned it.  The Complete Book of Essential Oils and Aromatherapy is a much better text.  Also consult Valnet's books for better information 
 These shakers are adorable. Very small and cute... BUT, unless you look closely at them, it's very easy to mix them up. My husband has fits over them and swears he'll find a way to mark them "S" and "P" if I don't switch them out. Often we'll use the larger range shakers by Fiesta instead of these. Buy the range shakers instead of these if you can find them. I bought mine from Amazon 
 AKA Shaolin Temple 3, this movie is a decent display of Jet Li's kung fu prowess. If the version being offered is by Telefilms International / Beverly Wilshire Filmworks - buyer beware!  The film is NOT widescreen (as it says it is), and the subtitles are cut off by the formatting.  If you are a Jet Li fan like me, you will enjoy the action sequences, though they are sparse.  Creative stances and good moves from Jet save them.  I recommend this film to die-hard Jet fans ONLY - kung fu purists will be very disappointed.  Jet Li picks up his role as the orphan raised by Shaolin, his sifu from the previous two films returns as well.  If you like Jet, and like the series, go for it.  Not Jet's best, not his worst, either.  Picture and sound quality is poor.  Directed by Lau Ka-leung 
 This book is not very well written.  It jumps from one detailed description to another, without giving enough overview or bridging material.  It seems like this book evolved from presentation slides, and the author failed to include enough of the bridging, higher-level exposition that keeps people oriented from slide to slide.  This is a little disappointing, and it makes it more difficult to get value from this book 
 I hated this book.  This family has two girls, Racie and Jaynell.  Rachie is a girly-girl and Jaynell is a tomboy.  It seems like the only person who loves her is her grandpa.  Her parents are just plain crazy.  Mama repedily whipped Racie with a flyswatter because she ate a sugar cookie and the dad threatens to "tear up" their hides each time they do something he does not like.  Once Jaynell said something out of turn and he grabed her shirt collar, nearly strangleing her, and pushed her rougly to her mama and forced her to apologize. Then Jaynell says that she will flench everytime she sees a flyswatter and she gets really scared when mama uses it on Racie.  Her parents are just crazy.  Then grandpa dies.  Dad becomes even angrier and mama just looses it.  I understand that sparking fear in a child's eye is a good thing.  Children should be afraid of their parents-but this is crazy.  Racie just ate one cookie and from that one mistake she recives a thrashing that is talked about in two paragraphs.  Jaynell says that she could hear the repeted blows and it just sounded aweful.  These people were crazy.  This book is crazy 
 This book is way overated.  Its way-out, wacky treament of electronics could definitely not be that of any well thought-of engineer.  It's frankly just a bunch of goofy unsystematic mumbo-jumbo by some over-educated self-proclaimed "physicists."   So imagine my surprise when I read a translation of this in Russian.  I think the whole world must have been duped.  Do yourself a favor.  Go read the Smith book (see my other reviews) and avoid this one like the plague 
 The thing I hate about this magazine is the letters to the editor section. Supposedly, they're written by real people. But after reading this magazine for the last few years, these letters all seem to have the same maudlin, soporific, sappy style of prose that reads to me like they've been EDITED that way. There's this condescending "athletes are supposed to behave like GOOD ladies and gentlemen and if they don't, then tsk tsk - WHAT WILL THE CHILDREN THINK?" mentality that I absolutely HATE. The good things about SI are the photography and whatever articles on the NBA they have any given week. And the swimsuit issue? I guess if you're a 13-14 year old it's exciting as all get out - I'll take the HARD STUFF any day over their annual fleshfest 
 I was disappointed with the book.  She did a lot of skipping around.  I was expecting more about her journey but she always just ended up talking about how wonderful she is.  
 Have been using this for a couple of days now and sorely disappointed. If you move the compass (of your own choice or it falls off the windshield), you need to recalibrate it. I've been sitting at stop lights and seen a 10º swing of direction. I have no intention of keeping this because of its lack of user friendliness 
 I picked this book up because it was on a book club's book list.  I actually had to go through InterLibrary Loan to get it since it wasn't available at my library.  After reading and forcing myself to finish it, I envision the head librarian at my branch shredding all copies to line hen cages, which would explain why a book club item wasn't available in a library.  Or perhaps the book club people had gone temporarily mad, who can say.  Many other reviewers have commented on the one-dimensional characters, the wooden pace, the absence of any attempt to sketch character motivation, but no one has mentioned the idiotic prose that flows, page after page, endless as the wine in Salim's cup.  "He looked down, and there was something sticking out from his belly.  It was a sword," is a paraphrased example of what you might find in this book, or with equal probability and more purpose, on an SNL skit.  This is a badly written book, if you had no interest in Mughal history, you will not have any interest in it after reading this book.  If you thought that was a wonderful period rich in complexity, you'd shred this book and line the hen cages too 
 its just a review not enough to explain usmle type question 
 I have been reading science fiction for about 40 years and the best I can recall, this is one of my least favorite.  Although some may like Jon Courtenay Grimwood's style of writing (if this is representative, not having read any before) I found it very hard to follow and very disjointed.  Although the central idea of the novel is a good one, the author, in my opinion, seems to wander away from the story line to provide meaningless details that tend to confuse the reader.  I have made it about half way through the novel but I am finding it very hard to complete 
 The Book from Alex Haley when I read it some 10 years ago changed my life and views of people with color, and everyone should read it, yes even conservatives, manditory.    however, this movie something just wasnt good.   to long?  the over all acting?    Spike, you make some great movies, Summer of Sam is one of your best, Do the Right Thing. Spike has a gift for cinematography, however   Spike Lee Interview on ESPN? The interview said,   interviewer:  "Kanye West said that Bush doesn't care about black people. Would you agree with that?   Lee:  "Yes, I agree with that, BUT I'll go one step further and say that Bush doesn't care about people who don't have any money (whether they're black or white.) I guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on Long Island or let's say The Hamptons, you would have had an entirley different response from FEMA and his administration."   But you should have seen how he said it, it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face. The dude is bold man, I'll give him that and I applaude him.   Spike said either black, white, Mexican, or asian.  But what he DIDN'T say was Italians!!   That dude has been getting flack forever for his dis'n of Italians in his movies, they call him a racist all the time.   HERE WAS HIS CHANCE to say something, and he blew it.   just didn't happen to say Italians?   NO  So HE is a racist too.   And so are the Africans in Africa, they never have liked white people either, so what about that Spike? Try going over their and applying for a job!   And while I am at, the African Americans in even Baton Rouge don't want the blacks from N.O. coming up their! How come spike never said anything about that?   Fkn whiners, so many the world over! give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on TV and let the world see it for the fools they are.   And ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling Da Truth  
 These cables are usually aftermarket and made somewhere in Asia. With that being said the quality control can be poor and there is no guarantee that it will work unless they test it before it is shipped. The software being aftermarket too, has glitches if it even works with yoyr phone. Despite what the descriptions say, this software and cable are not compatable with Mac at this time 
 There's one thing you will learn at the end of this movie (and it isn't even the title); that Mel Gibson is a good looking man. That's pretty much it.   So, Mel can read women's minds. So cue LOTS of scenes of women checking him out, forming clear, straight sentences in their minds (does anyone talk to themselves like the women in this movie? If anyone could read anyone's mind, wouldn't it just be a bunch of indeciphrable gibberish, half sentences, words, songs and ideas?)  But I digress. I can buy any premise if it's well thought out and, for a comedy - funny. And this isn't any of those things. Instead we get to see Mel mugging to the camera for an hour and a half until all you want to do is smash his head in with a shovel, Psycho II style. "Are you sure you won't have any tea, Mel? CLANNNNNNNG". Now THAT I would watch.  So, is this DVD What Women Want? Maybe, but only the really stupid ones.  The_Curmudgeon_Hates_You@yahoo.co.u 
 As was described in other reviews, This book in big, unorganized heap of too short anecdotes (half page), which become boring very quickly. One of worst kind of popular science book. May be her talent are better suited for other fields. 
 This book was rather fun to read but I am not convinced that the authors have as deep an understanding of the phenomena they are writing about as they would like the readers to believe.  The book reads like a narrative, full of assertions that are not backed by rigorous analysis of hard evidence.  The authors do not critically explore causal relationships, nor do they talk about research that has done so.  They present only one particular perspective on the unfolding of events, and they do not defend this perspective against potential criticism.  My experience with economics has always reinforced the idea that causality can be difficult to establish, and can often operate in unexpected ways.  An economist must proceed skeptically, being careful to explore alternative explanations and being prepared to defend assertions with theory and data.  The authors do not seem to share this view, taking instead a more naive approach.  Maybe I was expecting too much; after all this book is meant to be accessible to non-economists.  However, making a book more accessible does not necessitate a lack of rigour or the absence of critical thought; the authors could have removed some of the redundancy in the book (their writing is far from concise!) and replaced it with explorations of alternative perspectives.  The book would be greatly enriched by adding more discussion of research that supports (or opposes) their views 
 Very disappointed with this DVD.  Like I said above, if you want to view a rockumentary watch VH1 alot cheaper.  Description very misleading 
 I flipped through this at the Midnight Special in Santa Monica and alighted on the chapter on finding an agent, since I was looking for a new agent at the time (and am still looking). When the author recommends going to writer's conferences, because agents often attend them, I tossed the book back on the shelf with a snort of derision. This book presents a superficial overview of various subjects and doesn't have nearly enough concrete examples, like a full book proposal or sample query letters. This is the same old stuff I've seen in every other writing book 
 While I do not doubt that Gregory Snook is a very talented programmer, the code shown in this book and on the accompanying CD are proof enough, I believe that this book is of no use to anyone except for the most experienced professionals who have weeks of time to burn learning about Terrain Engines. I am not the most experienced programmer, having only worked with C++ and DX for 4 years now, but the problem with this book is not in complex concepts, but in content. All of the fundamentals of creating and rendering terrain are covered, but the example code and the engine (Gaia) on the CD are overly complex for any sort of educational book. Possibly every single library that Snook referenced has special wrapper functions and classes around them, making an examination of any code snippet next to useless unless the reader has spent days going through dozens of wrapper classes learning all of Snook's syntax. While I do enjoy owning this book as a conceptual reference, I am afraid that it is next to useless as an aid in practical programming scenarios 
 My son was very excited about putting together this little blue robot. Although it looks cute and creative, when we put the robot together, we were both disappointed. The parts come apart as easily as they go together. It makes for a frustrating experience for a child. I think it was a waste of money. I hope the publishers of this book can re-think the design for future children 
 Sorry, Babs.  You can't call yourself a Christian and also be so judgmental about your son or the so-called "homosexual lifestyle."  If we're throwing labels around, we might just as well call it "the heterosexual lifestyle." Gimme a break; it's 2004, lady. 
 Be sure when you order this book you are getting the version you wish to purchase. The full size paperback is a gem. The minature edition is a waste of money. Be aware that the postage on the minature edition costs more than buying a second volume of the book on line used 
 ...because I thought White Oleandar was brilliant. But this book? Not so much. I would not be surprised if Paint it Black were something Fitch wrote before she got her bestseller published. It felt much less fully realized. I found the text to be sprawling, unedited, self-indulgent. I generally have no problem with unreliable and/or unlikable narrators, but this one was more tiring than she was menacing. The whole book was written in one note, so I, too, agree with the "flat" description. I found the characters (the distant, brilliant, rich mother; the sassy best friend; the beautiful, troubled boyfriend) to be very stock and borderline cliche. I absolutely savored every word of Fitch's first book; reading this one, unfortunately, was like returning to a restaurant where you'd had the most amazing creme brulee of your life, only to find it cold and runny the second time you ordered it. 
 I didn't think it was difficult to set up but it clearly isn't designed well.  The target that hangs inside the cage doesn't actually fit.   And..... the netting doesn't stop the balls.  How's that for a good product.  1 out of 5 balls rips right through the net.    Buy anything else 
 Dit 
 Bryson is certainly witty. But any pleasure in the book was ruined by the author's snotty and obnoxious tone. I can not understand why the author thinks he is better than the people everywhere he visits; there is certainly no objective evidence in support of his inflated self-image. What a whining, immature, mean jerk. And by the way, there's a fair sprinkling of gutter language in the book. 
 I don't know what language the people in this movie are speaking but it's not English. What comes out of their mouths is a whole lot of nonsense and you end up watching these characters go from point A to point D and have no idea why or what they're doing. Towards the beginning of the movie, Leto and Gyllenhaal visit this lunatic before heading out on their road trip. This guy goes on a rant about God only knows what for what seems like 15min and you can tell by the look on Leto and Gyllenhaal's faces that they wish they were in any movie besides this one. All of the characters in this movie are obnoxious and you care nothing about any of them. But what I found to be the most ridiculous is how these character kept bumping into each other. The movie starts out in Nevada and ends in Washington. Somehow, they all just happen to have run-ins. And what was the point of Alligator Boy? Seriously?   This movie should have been 10min long. Leto has sex with that guy's wife, they break his feet, the end 
 Just not funny, I returned the book and got my money back 
 I am very interested in the Fragments affair and was eager to read this new account of it. Unfortunately I found this book disappointing. It adds little new to the other published works, notably historian Stefan Maechler's excellent account which was published in English last year. While Eskin has a good style, his narrative is jumbled, he skips around a lot and it is often hard to work out what is going on. Also Eskin virtually ruins his own book by going on endlessly about himself when it is really not relevant to Wilkomirski's story. There are too many unnecessary uses of the words I, me, and myself by Eskin to make this a focussed study of the Fragments affair 
 Barber is painfully boring and his views are over the top liberal.  Read it for school and would not wish reading this on my worst enemy 
 I saw this design and thought it was a great idea. After using it twice my wrists still hurt. Now I know why I couldn't find this design at my local sporting goods store 
 I normally don't write reviews, but I wish the authors of this book would have put their selves in the shoes of those who wish to improve their gameplay.  The strategy's are very limited.  There is nothing on the best approaches to take in the game sequence.  I'm disappointed that nothing is in depth about unit counters. I wish there was a good explanation on the use of hotkeys, and how best to group units. I also wish there was an easy to use chart showing the attributes of the game units.  In a way Company Heroes reminds me of the Age Of Empires series but it is far superior.  However the strategy guide book for Age of Empires is far superior to this book, and was the type of game information I was expecting 
 As a big fan of the Postal Service (their "Give Up" easily makes the cut on my top 10 albums), I had high expectations for this Dntel record, as Jimmy Tamberello is one half of the Postal Service. BIG mistake. Listen to the samples: if you like what you hear, then buy it; if you don't like what you hear, don't make my mistake of thinking that the songs get better beyond the 30 seconds given. Worthwhile songs on this CD: 1)"(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan" (The Postal Service remix is available on iTunes, and is a better version than what's on the CD), sung by Ben Gibbard of Death Cab and Postal Service. 2)"Last Songs" is if anything, relaxing. I recommend getting these two songs on iTunes and leaving it at that, save some money.  The CD's too expensive for two decent songs.  Jimmy Tamberello has another digital project that he works called Figurine and (more recently) James Figurine, it's essentially a catchier, poppier version of Dntel, more in line with Postal Service 
 I'm actually quite surprised by the other reviews on this page. I love a good true crime story and was very excited to have found this one about Albert Fish. However, after the first quarter of the book, all it did was repeat itself about the same incident. It became comical. Yes, it was interesting to learn of what had happened to the little girl he had snuck away in guise of going to a birthday party, but how many times can you describe it and recant it until you're beating a dead horse. Albert Fish is definitely a criminal that needs to be known about, but this book could have cut 3/4 of it out and still relayed the same information. A waste of time in my opinion 
 I bought this for my son, who will be leaving the military within the next year.  I was disappointed at the number of schools covered, especially in Ohio. It did not cover public Universities such as Kent State or University of Akron. I am still not sure what group of students this book has some use for... 
 this product does nothing.  i put in 30 dvds and vcds and none were able to be copied.  easy dvd burner if u can actually find a dvd that is able to burn.  everything is copy protected...and i hear that over and over again.  there is a reason why this product is so cheap...BECAUSE IT DOES NOTHING AT ALL!  u CANT burn dvds.  you can only take a few files you might already have and burn them on a disk that does not play on a dvd player.  thats it.  dont waste you money on this.  its worthless.. 
 This is supposed to be "the" bible on Excell. And it is; it has everything there's to know. BUT, if you need to get your answers fast in order to get your work done, don't buy this book. This book, as well as other "bibles" series, are design with a whole CD program with sample exercises. If you go thru them, step by step, you'll learn your stuff. But, if you just need to get into the topic of getting something done quickly, you will find that their explanation is EXACTLY AS THE HELP FUNCTION ON THE SOFTWARE. And then, the will give you an example from that CD program. Believe me, if you don't want to go thru the whole reading process and just need answers in a need basis, this book won't do it. The same applies to the Access Bible.. 
 Look to other sources for SCA Arts & Sciences documentation.  This book is only useful as a good first place for beginner costumers to look for ideas.  Norris doesn't list his sources and redrawings cannot be used for costuming documentation.  Save your money 
 This is one of the worst books I have ever read.  Its title deceives us.  We expect to see things like "kittens are cuddly," or "mothers love us."  Instead we read "snow is white," and "rain is wet."  We are led to believe there is something important in "whiteness" and "wetness," but these are merely descriptions of the world about us.  In giving such bland descriptions, the author attempts to derive values from facts, in effect deadening our senses to what should be depicted for children as a wonderful world.  The fact of the matter is, there's nothing important about this book at all.  Discard it! 
 I was very disapointed. The women can't sing. They sounded very cheesy and bland. Every now and then you night hear a sound that hits the spot, but most of the time tumbs down.. They got old real quick. I don't really think I will be listening to this album much at all. Don't waste your money. 
 I agree with the comments about the taste and size.  Personally I think someone should look into the false advertising.  On the preztel kit, which is also a "4 pack", you only get two pretzels.  One of the packs is salt and another is glaze.  Then you get two packs of some pretzel dough.  These pretzels are not much larger than the ones you get in a bag out of the vending machine.  Total rip-off.  Hasbro should be ashamed of its marketing staff 
 This book simply throws ideas out that are simply ridiculous. I think I'll be lucky to make use of more than 2 or 3 of these monsters. The only ones that are remarkable are the new giants (and seriously you'd have to plan a whole campaign to make these fit somehow). Unless you like to throw random monsters at your players (which is a lame way to DM and is even more boring than fighting the same monsters again and again) this book is just too bizzarre. I'm agonna avoid MM4 too. With this trend, the new monsters could be nothing other than preposterous 
 I love the story of Robin Hood. So much so, that I have watched just about every rendition of it. This one is aweful. Robin comes home an old man to his equally older Maid Marian.He apparently had very little  concern for her seeing as he never bothered to come home to claim her. In my opinion, she should have married someone else, but instead she became a nun.Oh, that's romantic.And finally, at the end of the movie,  she poisons them both.  Hello...that is just depressing. If she can't have the rest of his life, then they might as well go out together. I will concede that this is fresh new take on a very old story, but come on.... where is the joy? All there was to take away from this movie was sadness. 
 Although the maps were helpful, much of this book seemed outdated.  Addresses were wrong, business gone and reviews questionable 
 Nothing innovative or exciting. Anyone who does not know this stuff should not be in business or in a leadership positio 
 I was forced to read this, and attend multiple seminars from the Blanchard group.  Our CFO lives by the concepts, and he is running our department into the ground by following them.  The book is mostly fluff and took less than an hour to read.  There is ONE good point that I got from it, and that is when setting goals for people they should be trackable, relevant, and attainable.  I got that message in about 5 minutes though.  The rest anyone should already know -- praise in public and reprimand in private.  No kidding, learned that the first time I got humiliated in grade school.  Skip the book, and polish that resume if you are forced to read it 
  There is something about "Fountainhead" that irritated and disappointed  me, so I would stop reading and come back to it again. At some point, I just gave up thinking about the philosophical aspect of the novel  and tried to enjoy it as a piece of literature. What can I say? I  understand with my mind the ideas about the purpose of human  beings to be free and follow their own unique way in pursuit of happiness  and full realization of their talents and abilities. I also find very attractive the idea of always being true to yourself and  to your trade no matter what and to never compromise your principles and never betray yourself. Yes, I  understand that completely but the main character, Howard Roark, who supposed to be a hero  and an ideal Man left me indifferent. Well, he is not a human being, really,  more like Titan (Prometheus would come to mind), but he is cold as ice. He  does not care about anybody or at least he is doing a very good job in  hiding the human emotions. The love story in the novel is repulsive and sickening. The female character, Dominique, looks like a cold frigid doll that is not able to feel love unless it goes together  with hate and domination. Why do they have to be so unhappy and make me, the reader so miserable?    The only character who I think is  very interesting, Gail Waynad - the  man who was able to learn everything he knew by himself with no help from  outside whatsoever, the man who named his beloved yacht "I Do" because he  does rule places and has a right to say so.   2.5/5  
 Sadly, this book is similar to most on venture capital in that it is based on interviews of VCs. The weakness behind this approach is that it provides unorganized content that lacks depth and utility.  In short, while it doesprovide some important insight, these insights are neither unique or critical and can be found in other books that provide a much better resource to the entrepreneur.  
 Snakes on a plane: the book.  If you've just read Dawkins' books such as The Selfish Gene or The Blind Watchmaker and think this might be a good follow up please think twice!  This is not a science book and reads much more like a self help book. There is a very low content/noise ratio as it delivers very few ideas, and then expounds upon the same ideas over and over again using every new metaphor or anecdote the author can imagine. I couldn't even finish it as I was bored to tears and eventually just felt completely patronized and then annoyed by the author's sloppy understanding of the science involved.   He repeatedly refers to natural selection as a "kludge" which shows a complete lack of understanding of Dawkins' material.  If you want a good laugh at Brodie's incompetence with even basic statistics use Amazon's Inside This Book feature to read the paragraph on page 173 that begins "Now let's get a handle on what it really means..." (you can also search on the number 6500 to find this page). Either the author is clueless, or the people on this island have 1-year lifespans.   How did this guy get published? 
 Book has much useful information in it. However, from a "how to" perspective the book has enough faults that I would choose another. The tree felling portion seemed particularly bad: a couple of horror stories on tree felling are followed by some sub-par descriptions on tree felling methods -  the part on "bore" cuts is especially badly described and illustrated - it should have been better handled or left out entirely. Quite frankly, the authors frequent citing of OSHA as an authority on cutting methods made me a bit nervous too. Somehow, I think I would prefer cutting advice from a professional lumberjack than a governmental bureaucracy....but thats a matter of taste I suppose.  
 Sean Hannity is a joke, all of these pundits are. WE should dig a hole and push them all in, then throw in a few starving tigers. That would roc 
 I truly wanted to like this book but found it completely self-indulgent and just boring. Navarro tries so hard to come of as an intellectual and really just comes off as a loser with too much time on his hands. I had to force myself to finish it - I'm glad I bought it from bookcloseouts 
 If you're looking for a quick mystery read, then this was the way to go.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  After my book club read "Ain't Nobody's Business" we were eager to try one of Wilson Wesley's mysteries.  However, the group's general consensus was that the book was too short, too predictable, and the storyline was not all that original.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from reading her mainstream novels, though

 The book is confusing. What is the reader supposed to believe? Clemens was a genius, or, Clemens was an imbecile? "Mark Twain an Illustrated Biography" starts with a preface that says: Sam Clemens was a "genius." Next comes the prologue, which states "his own overreaching drove him and his family into exile oversaes."---That statement could not be farther from the truth. A book that starts by rejoicing in Twain's genius and, then proceeds completely to ignore Twain's genius and portray an imbecile is confusing.To understand the confusion and, put the narrative on page 177 in context, review this sentence: "When she died, she was only twenty-four years old." What is the purpose of the word "only" in that sentence? Putting "only" in the sentence confuses facts and, by that confusion makes a biased sentence. Susy was twenty-four years old: An age by anybody's standards where she is old enough to be responsible for her own health. By combining that sentence with "only" and the pictures of a young Susy on pages 87, 94, 99, 103, 105, 119, 132, 146, 150, the book alleges that Susy was very young when she died, which is not true.It was the family publishing business alone that went bankrupt, not Clemens, a fact previously canvassed on page 157 but by page 177 forgotten; The financial recession of 1893, which was responsible for making the tour necessary and separating the family, was not Clemens fault and he would have to be an absolute fool rather than a genius to think otherwise, a fact previously canvassed on pages 155 & 156 but by page 177 forgotten; Clemens knew that he was in no way whatsoever responsible for the death of Susy; When Susy died, she was not the first child that Sam and Livy had buried; What Sam includes in his letter on page 177 are emotions experienced after losing their first child a son, not emotions consistent with losing their second child Susy. Canvassed initially, the book describes how Sam becomes inured to death by experiencing so many deaths in his life. Then on page 177 it is as if death is a brand-new idea, which Sam, has no familiarity with at all? It cannot be both ways, either he was inured or he was not.Sam's writing was so powerful that he easily conveyed feelings that he did not feel; Sam's writing conveys feelings that he does not feel to relieve Livy's feelings of responsibility and grief: Clemens is magnanimously taking responsibility for things that he knows he is not responsible for to soothe his ailing wife (Sam wrote a similar letter after the death of his brother Henry, see page 20, only an idiot would believe himself responsible for too much steam when he was not even on the boat with Henry.); Livy had been diagnosed with heart problems, which forced the family move to Europe in 1891, a fact previously canvassed on page 145 where it incorrectly states "They [doctors] recommended rest and treatment for Livy in Europe," the facts being rather that Livy was "ordered" to Europe by her doctors, but by page 177 the facts after being distorted are forgotten and without thorough study or instruction, the facts are presented with a vagueness that makes' them impossible to understand.Unequivocally, Clemens in 1906 stated for his autobiography, [Edited by Charles Neider, page 428], Livy was "ordered" to Europe by her doctors. If Clemens knew, Livy was ordered to Europe in 1906, it's only fair to assume he knew Livy was "ordered" to Europe when he wrote that magnanimous letter on page 177 taking responsibility for things that he knew he was not responsible for in 1896. And just as fairly, without any assumption, we may know that Clemens knew he did not cause the financial recession of 1893. Sam's stay in Europe, which he loathed and called exile, was never exile at all, but concession to his love for his wife, Livy, and the requirements mandated by her heart trouble.In all honesty, Clemens was being magnanimous when he wrote "Reproaching myself for laying the foundation of all our troubles. . . . Reproaching myself for a million things whereby I have brought misfortune and sorrow to this family."---found on page 177. Clemens was being far from honest, unless he was responsible for the financial recession of 1893, responsible for Livy's heart problems that forced the families move to Europe in 1891, and responsible for Susy's health when Susy was of an age to be responsible for her own health and had been living on her own separated by half-a-world from Sam and Livy for most of a year.For an entertaining book that does not confuse these important issues I recommend: MEET MARK TWAIN, published by Xlibris 
  I have to rate this product and this company as horrible!!  I purchased the X2 in 12/2004. Everything was fine. In 6/2005, the lamp blew. Less than 300 hours on it!!! I called the company. They said sometimes it happens. I questioned the projector. They said I just needed a new lamp. $300.00 later.....oh, you can only get the lamps from them. You can only get service on the X2 from them.  I get the new lamp. It just blew again-about 700 hours-half of what the life should be. Additionally, the fan died-which may be why the lamp blew. Maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago (when it was STILL under warranty but they wouldn't look at it!!!) No. They say no.  The projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place. The projector was blown clean on a regular basis. This projector was not mistreated or misused.  Infocus says "sometimes this happens".  They, for $250, plus $30.00 shipping, will fix the fan. I also need to buy a new lamp-another $300. The company keeps saying-"It is out of warranty", "sometimes this happens", "1400 hours is just what some lamps get", etc., etc,. etc.. They will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product.  I will get a new projector-I can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one. My new projector WILL NOT/WILL NEVER be an Infocus product.  They have failed to stand behind their product. Their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties.  Don't buy Infocus!!! 
 I listened to "Piece of Mind" religiously for almost two years.  It never left my disc changer.  "Concious" has two or three notable songs.  But it does not have the consistency of "Piece of Mind."  She seems to be aiming for commercial success.  She does not take as many risks with this one and there is too much filler.  
 I am really disappointed with this book. It's packed full of broadly presented and common-sense information. Most of the advice the book recommends will come very natural to you. I've read 150 pages so far and haven't really learned anything. It's also divided by subject, not age, which results in the book approaching subjects very broadly.  It often gives the same advice for 1 and 3 year-olds,  and anyone who has ever been around these ages understands that this is not practical. A 1 year-old is barely off the bottle, can't communicate well, isn't potty-trained, and is barely learning to hold a spoon! Instead, I recommend other book, which offers a month-by-month guide -"What to Expect the Toddler Years" for more detailed info on illnesses, developmental milestones, nutrititional guidance, etc.  
 While I am not qualified to pass judgement on sculpture as far as methods of actually creating works of art,as a art foundry owner,I have reasonable background in usage of diferent materials connected with sculpture. I found this book to be of rather limited use to anyone seeking information on materials in use today. Almost all refererences are very dated and may be considered useful if a study of yesteryear's practices are intended.It appears to me,that information on various metals and their processing  in particullar is more or less imprecise and in some cases wrong altogethrer-for example:to aneal common aluminium alloy to "pink" heat means going past melting point!To sum up,if you intend to learn current practices, go elsewhere 
 I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen! And confusing too! The are a lot of bad flash backs, and fast-fast forward scenes of boats tied up in a dock, with the sun coming up or down.   Lew(Dominic Purcell) is laughable as a sign painter.  There is actually a scene where he is bent double hammering over his head on to a sign he's working on, that is down on the ground and half burried in the dusty dirt! You can tell he dosen't have a clue to what he is doing!  Then after he finds out about the planned kidnapping, he is supposly sneeking, and peeking around bushes. Like a man of Purcell's size(he's 6'1"or so, and wieghs about 200 pounds) can sneek around in someone's front yard and not be seen?  Come on! I kept waiting for someone to call 911 to report a peeking Tom!  I have to warn you that there are a lot of sex scenes!  Bad ones at that! I guess the director wanted to get them over with-real fast-to move on to the next badly written scene!   At least you get to see Dominic Purcells nude butt! Which maybe the only reason to see this movie, if you like that sort of thing!  And Purcell gets beaten up alot-by everyone in this movie. I kept thinking 'come on Purcell your a big guy, you can take that little guy!' And worse a woman beats him up too!  I saw this listed as a comedy, well maybe a comedy of errors!  While being intervied Dominic Purcell dosen't even mention this movie, when he lists all the movies that he has been-in.    And that should say something about this movie, if the guy who starred in it, would NOT even SAY he'd been in it 
 If you seriously know nothing about the opening then this book will probably help you some.  However, if you already have gathered all the basic concepts (which seem to be mentioned in pretty much every chess book ever made) then this book is a waste of money.  Even for the complete beginner, I reccomend the recent books Openings for White/Black Explained by Lev Alburt, Roman D., etc., which can serve as both an introduction and a full course.    I thought this book would give me a repertoir, so I would know some actual openings.  However, the coverage of any one opening is so minimal you definitely dont know enough to actually play it in anysort of competetive way.  To repeat: this book will not teach you to play openings competetively, it is only an introduction.  Seirawan briefly covers classical openings and then covers in slightly more depth his "opening solution" which is the Kings Indian Defense versus d4, the Pirc versus e4, and the Kings Indian Attack as White.  First off, I found I do not enjoy playing any of those openings at all.  What is the advantage of being able to play the same 5+ moves at the start of every game? Then what after that?  Well these openings are not devoid of theory and once you reach the end of the first 5 moves you have just as much work to do as with any other opening;  you have just delayed the inevidable conflict for the center--which means a slower, longer, duller game.  Secondly, if you do like these openings you will still have to buy more books that actually cover them!  I would reccommend, even if you are a beginner, to buy the Openings Explained for White / Black by Lev Alburt, Roman D.  Besides full coverage of the openings in the repertoir book, it also briefly covers some other traditional openings (just like winning chess openings).  If you want an introduction you have one in the first chapter; if you want to really LEARN an opening then you have that too.  Or if you already have an idea what openings your want to play then DEFINITELY don't get this book, instead get some thorough books on that/those openings 
 Was very disappointed with this book.  Not only did it cover only the most touristy places, but it left out many more interesting, not as common, sites.  The real tip off is that he lists places that "guarantee the price listed here if you show them your copy of this book" or offer a "10% discount" with this book.  That isn't really objective reporting in my opinion 
 Need I say more?  The purported environmental benefits are nonexistent: modern forestry makes the concept of recycling paper meaningless...  So the "green" benefit is purely emotional 
 To me, this book was far too long for the plot. I became so bored just waiting for something to happen that I quit the book right in the middle; skimmed to the end to see who the killer was. The plot would have been a good one had she not drug it out so long 
 the first time i used this product, my cake stuck to the bottom, extrememly bad. 
 This is a product of the lazy, latter-day Leonard who knows he's a great writer who can just sit back and let it flow. The onetime master of concision now takes a hundred-odd pages just to set things up.  Even his ear for dialogue has started to fade on him. Now everybody like, y'know, talks like, uhh, some kinda boob, get what I'm sayin'? The line of self-parody is lying a little too close in these pages.  He still has a hand with the quirky minor characters, though they can't carry an entire 350-page plus novel. But this one did make it clear to me why Leonard is so popular with the pomo crowd: his characters inhabit an utterly amoral universe, one with no values or standards whatsoever. Here, e.g., the protagonist is that well-known figure drawn from life, the friendly, easygoing loan shark. In your traditional crime novel--Chandler or either MacDonald can serve as examples--the action occurs against a hard-edged moral framework that is at least given lip service. Now I won't demand that every piece of fiction act as a morality play. But this was a case where I finished the thing, and kind of enjoyed the ride, but didn't like myself for it. In Leonard's recent novels, all that matters is who gets to take home the candy. And when you get right down to it, that just ain't enough. 
 I have tried to order twice from this company.  The first time I waited over eight months and cancelled the order.  I accidently ordered from them a second time, but when they mentioned a delay, I looked them up.  Do not order from them 
 I found this book to be very average. It glosses over subjects poorly, giving me the impression that the author doesn't have a great understanding of the topics discussed. If there wasn't other great books available, or superb video sites like winstructor.com I would then recommend this. But seeing as books like Mastering Windows Server 2003 and Introducing Windows Server 2003 exist and of course winstructor, then I cannot comprehend why someone would feel they got their money's worth with a purchase of this title 
 My daughter brought these books home with her from her vacation!  Very racy stuff for a 13 year old.  Lots of the F work and the F deed is never actually done, but always speculated about and a distinct possibility, what with all that cuddling in bed.    I wonder if these books were "created" to sell stuff.  On every page you get  stuff like:  Muffie got out her new Vixen by Ralph Lauren nail polish...  All I can say is, every generation has a right to read the trash of it's choice, but this stuff, with it's crass commercialism and truly horrid characters, gave me the creeps.  Ughums.  I think I'll sell the lot on [...] for [...] 
 As anyone who makes a living designing books can tell you, most books are not $200 art books. But that's what Derek Birdsall seems to concentrate on in his "Notes on Book Design." Really, it's a no-brainer to make the art as large as possible and have the specs in a sans serif font. I don't need endless examples showing me exactly that. I'd like to see what Birdsall does with 30,000 words that the publisher insists page out to 272 pages in a 6 x 9 size, but "not look too horsey or airy." I bet he'd quit.  Addditionally, his choice of a typewriter font for the text make the book useless to the reader. Birdsall insists his publisher could not choose a better font--I doubt that.  I got one for ya, Birdsall--Garamond. You should try it some time!   Ultimately, the tome serves neither the page designs shown as illustrations (too small in most cases) nor the reader. Perhaps a design student may get something out of this, but there must be better books out there on the same subject 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 If you're looking for good Aftermath-produced or G-Unit affiliated music, here's which artists to go to and which to stay far, far away from:   50 Cent-- Go nowhere near The Massacre. You're 5% more likely to suffer a slow, painful death just by touching the case. It is the worst CD you could possibly ever hear. Same thing goes with the movie soundtrack.  Get Rich or Die Tryin (the original) on the other hand, is solid... especially on those bonus tracks (Heaven, Life on the Line, U Not Like Me), Patiently Waiting, 21 Questions, and anything featuring another G-Unit member. PIMP, with its lack of Snoop Dogg (which the music video seemed to promise), High All the Time, Many Men, and Wanksta can kind of get old though.  The thing about 50 Cent these days is that by himself he is no longer any good at all. He needs to be held up by a crutch of some better rapper before he can make good with his own rap. The reason he succeeds so well in his collaborations with The Game in The Documentary and Eminem in The Re-Up is because he has actually GOOD rappers holding him up. He's like the Abbott of the comedians Abbott & Costello now. He has nothing worth contributing without his Costello of some kind to be there for him.   The Game-- As soon as I heard this guy's album and compared it to 50's Massacre, I knew that if G-Unit was going anywhere, this guy would be the one to take it there. And now it turns out he left. Can't blame him when the clique-label's leader is so dumb. Was the most progressive rapper of the crew, and his reason for leaving is probably because of how anti-progressive 50's Massacre was. Has the best, deepest subject matter within his songs, if not the best flow (Although his underground 300 Bars song would automatically crown him king if he did that well all the time on his main albums). As far as the mainstream and not underground CDs go though, I'd give him a 2nd best for flow of the G-Unit crew.  His Documentary album has been called the third Chronic, and has the best of Dre's beats you'll find on any G-Unit CD. Criticisms are that he name-drops Dre & NWA a bit too much, but overall, I think it's not that big of a deal. He's a big hip-hop history fan, and he's still a little starstruck over the chance of being able to work with Dre. Given a very brief profile of the rapper, he fits into an uncomfartable stereotype, (average-looking rapper from Compton who's been shot a few times), but he immediately carves a personality of his own in the Doctor's Advocate and his even better The Documentary.   Young Buck-- I'd say probably the best G-Unit member still in G-Unit. This guy has the best flow, as far as mainstream CDs are concerned. He also seems to be the 2nd-most concerned about the world (a.k.a. 'progressive'), with references to the Illuminati amongst other secret organizations. I like this guy the best of the remaining G-Unit. 2nd best comes sort of close to him, but still doesn't match Buck's raw skills.  Lloyd Banks-- This guy is second best. His flow skills somewhat tie for 2nd place with The Game's, or at least land in that area. He, Buck, and The Game are my top three for G-Unit (even though The Game's not G-Unit anymore). Anybody else you can probably pass up. I'll go over them real quick just to make sure you know who the others are beforehand.    Tony Yayo-- The one male member who is worse than 50 Cent. In the G-Unit CD, they always shouted 'Free Yayo!' and now he is free. The G-Unit had done a terrible thing by campaigning for his release. His is of no benefit whatsoever to them. He might even be responsible for the gradual dumbening of 50's style & outlook on life.   Joe-- The kind of R&B star you'd expect to sing chorus or backup on an Outkast track, mixed with a bit of R. Kelley and a very small splash of Stevie W. He's not bad I guess. I hated him completely on 'Wanna Get to Know You' of the G-Unit CD, but would definitely still listen to his 'Ride Wit U' track off his own solo album.   Olivia-- Pssh, are you dumb? No. She's partially responsible for Candy Shop. That should be reason enough to hate her full-on and never turn back. She kind of can't sing either. Bad move to make an R&B CD without being able to sing, I think.  Lil' Scrappy-- This is the same Lil' Scrappy you heard on Lil' Jon's "What U Gon Do?" track. He's pretty good. Decent at least. Definitely not as decent as 50 Cent's original Get Rich or Die Tryin, but decent. He's got a good enough style though that places him above everyone else still in G-Unit, excluding Lloyd Banks and Young Buck, but including 50 Cent by himself.   I think that's everybody. So... now you know all about G-Unit, and who's good and who's not. If you HAVE to buy G-Unit, now you know who to avoid and who to embrace. If you plan on buying the original Get Rich or Die Tryin, I suggest you don't. Burn it, or have a friend burn it for you. 50 doesn't need the money right now or ever again. If you decide not to buy G-Unit, then more power to you. The Game is actually now sort of the anti-G-Unit since he left, because, you know, the majority of their members still suck.  I'd suggest Mos Def's Black on Both Sides instead of any of this stuff though... even if you were planning on buying G-Unit. That's probably the best hip-hop album I've ever heard, or will hear 
 The author has her narrator("Cinnamon") spend most of her time comparing herself to the fascinating Scarlett,in a game of wish-fulfillment one-upmanship. Even though she's calling the shots,as it's her book, Scarlett still comes out miles ahead. Perhaps it was only that way for a certain strata of society,but there WAS once a beautiful world of chivalry and gallantry and bravery and even some idealism-even if misplaced-just as there has been throughout the ages in other societies,such as "Ivanhoe" presents.The story may have been one-sided,but it's the side MM chose to tell,and there's kernel of truth in the "myth" of the Old South,as in all myths.   Margaret Mitchell has nothing to fear from this silly so-called "parody",which is really a subconscious-or not so subconscious,in fact-effort to knock from her pedestal,that epitome of heroines-Katie Scarlett O'Hara and the wonderful Melanie Wilkes.As if Rhett would ever give any other woman a serious thought-he was obsessed with Scarlett.That's why he turned to women like Belle Watling.And to imagine Mammy killing the male babies,when she had been devoted to Ellen O'Hara from Ellen's childhood.Thank goodness this book isn't a pimple on the fanny of the classic GWTW,because what it is a a travesty-and not even a well-written or engaging one at that.GWTW will still be read and loved for all time,like the classic it is,when this book is selling for a quarter at garage sales.I didn't even pay that,thank goodness-the woman gave it to me,and I read it and burned it with the rest of the trash.I'd give it a negative star if there was such a rating.Ludicrous and laughable-try again,Ms Randall,and try to get over the jealousy of Scarlett and Co. Again,Margaret Mitchell need not fear,LOL 
 I see that some people were helped by this book.  I would not recommend this book for someone who has not experienced sex.  The advice to virgins was disgusting.  The writers say that the sexual act is not natural and that people need help enjoying it.  The writer also suggests techniques of preparation for the virgin the month before that most assuredly would either lead to depending on yourself for fulfillment or it would train a young lady to not be responsive.  I thought the book was sick.  It turns women into an object of function. It also talks about men being 100% head of the household and women being 100% submissive.  The authors are a husband and wife but I can't hear a woman's voice anywhere in this book.  The cover is pretty so she probably had something to do with that. I'm sure she submitted completely to him in the writing of this book and that is why it is completely clinical and even crude 
 When I saw the title, Hardcore Java, I expected that the content would be so intense, I might not understand much of it. But that wasn't the case. The book didn't live up to its name.  I think the thing that affected me the most negatively was the language. For example, the author provided sage advice about not calling System.exit() from libraries, but felt compelled to add the following which was longer than the advice: "Just imagine the look of surprise, consternation, and growing anger on the face of your users when they try to run the plug-in, and their application simply exits without bothering to save two hours worth of data. Although it sounds funny, it could lead to sore feet from looking for another job." While this might be cute once or twice, it gets tiresome and patronizing when used repetitively.  The book could have used more editing. I found the text garrulous and included far too many code samples, samples that were longer than they needed to be, and samples that repeated themselves. For example, the author's expose on member classes was 21 pages, while Josh Bloch offered more detailed and concise information in four pages in "Item 18: Favor static member classes over nonstatic" in his book on Effective Java.  I strongly disagreed with the author's recommendation about making helper methods protected, not private because somewhere, someday, someone might want to subclass your class. I'm in the middle of an extremely large refactoring job, and it has been complicated because the previous programmer had the same philosophy. The use of protected enabled the code to grow coupled beyond belief so it became impossible to modify one class without breaking dozens of others. Fortunately, I have Eclipse which helps me find which members are used elsewhere, and which are not. As I made the latter members private, Eclipse noted that many of them were not, in fact, used at all. But don't take my word for it: Josh Bloch in Effective Java also recommends against this practice in "Item 12: Minimize the accessibility of classes and members." In addition, making members protected to allow possible extension is not enough: "Item 15: Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it."  I only caught four typos, so I obviously needed to be reading more carefully ;-).  Now on to the better.  The chapter on the use of final everywhere was interesting and worth considering, although it seems to me that its use would severely lessen readability.  The example of a typesafe enum superclass was excellent and we've already incorporated an adaptation of it into our code base.  The chapter on references was also good, and contained real-world applications. But the chapter must be missing something as it occurred to me that if one uses Java's EventListener class, wouldn't their stuff already use weak references?  While there were a few other nuggets of information here and there, I'd still recommend Effective Java over this book 
 I have been practicing yoga for several years and was looking for a way to introduce it to my partner. I found this book to be poorly laid out and I did not feel it had a cohesive theme. The poses were awkward, did not have the insight I was looking for 
 These were a waste of money.  They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING, much less my backside, even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size.  I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy! 
  Save your money if you're looking for a read containing anything other than very "low key" romance (editorial and reader reviews give no indication as to just how "basic" are the romance aspects of this story).  My read led me to conclude this work is more closely aligned with the type of gay, youth fiction authored by such as Mark A. Roeder.  This is something that might be nice for others to know before purchase is made.   To repeat, this book is not particularly aimed toward adult readers; there are other much better written coming-out stories, providing more of a reading challenge for such readers.  Further, a major detraction is the atrociously bad editing and/or use of the English language.  Examples of this include words placed in the wrong part of a sentence, misspellings, storyline comments attributed to the wrong character (Joe's name mentioned as saying something when Jim is the one who would logically/correctly be making the statement).  Other such problems are also present.  I think the author, and we, might have been better served had he spent more time in his two alma mater's English departments and less in their film and screenwriting ones.   PS--Oh, and if you're hoping for more romance than a tongue-tangling kiss, you won't find it here 
 that was the worst novel ever.  I didn't follow the story line at all.  It seemed so random, almost like there wasn't a story line at all.  I was soooo confused with the book because I didn't see any characters except some hydrogen, cobalt, and zinc oxide.  There were so many marraiges between hydrogen and carbons and other oddly named people.  I was revolted when reading that 2 hydrogens married an oxygen.  DO NOT GET THIS BOOK.  IT IS POSSIBLY THE WORST STORY I HAVE HAD THE MISFORTUNE TO READ 
 Since so many popular chick-literature focuses on the privileged, glamorous lives of beautiful Manhattanites, I was curious to read this book which focuses instead on the lifestyle of women in Hollywood and suburban New Jersey (especially since I am former New Yorker, who lives in the New York suburbs and works in the New Jersey suburbs).    However, I was left disappointed and annoyed.  Compared to other popular chick-lit, the author's characters are fully-dimensional and likeable (compared to say Plum Sykes' inanely vapid and selfish characters in Bergdorf Blondes). It was for this reason that I finished the book, and other readers will want to as well, since the author excels at making the reader care about the characters.  However, advertised as a book about "friendship", this book is no different than any of the NYC-center chic-lit narratives which center on a have v. have not lifestyle. The problem being that in works such as "The Devil Wears Prada" or "The Ivy Chronicles" which are a humorous look at the lives of the haves, they make no particular moral statement about the class differentials of the have-nots.   Suburbanistas, on the other hand is infused with a subtle brand of class issues, and populist, democratic socialism and anti-corporate message which in my opinion has no place in chic-lit. What makes this subtle moralistic message annoying, is that in the end the glamorous, thin, beautiful woman from Hollywood continues to be fabulous and continue her acting on Broadway, while there is no Cinderella ending for her childhood friend from New Jersey. Since the author took it upon herself to promote a socially democratic message throughout the book, suggesting that at the end, both characters will achieve equality, to end the book with this obvious contraction is frustrating and annoying.  
 If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell.  Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning.  Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle?  The acting in this movie is "meh", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part.  The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you.  You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable.  
 Yeeeaaahhhh...so here I am in college waiting for this book that I ordered about a month ago, and it hasn't come yet, when my credit card number was taken, and I'm falling behind in this class, and I tried to get a hold of amazon but they won't get back to me. Hmm! Great!!! Gonna send it or what???? I'm getting pretty pissed, thanks 
 I've read The Other Boleyn Girl and a great deal of Philippa Gregory's other works and found them to be thoroughly enjoyable and hard to put down.  It is therefore unfathomable to me that she could have written such a disgusting, morally-repulsive "novel" (and I use the term loosely)such as this.    This book is about a woman's desperate need to retain control of the land she grew up on.  Land which, by legal rights, passed to her dimwitted, sexually depraved, mouse of a brother.  The incest scenes are rife and horrifyingly detailed.  I could not bring myself to even finish this book, and I certainly was not about to read the final two in the trilogy.  If you have even the smallest thread of moral fiber...run the other way.  This book will make you ill 
 This is not as big as it looks in the picture. It is tiny! You have to heat up the water yourself separately and then pour it into this piece of junk. There is no electric heating. Stay away from this 
 There is no objective advise here.  While I've worked in Cosmetics and know there is a lot of hype, there are great products out there that she just completely destroys - mostly anything plant based.  Not all here descriptions are valid and unless you have terribly sensitive skin, you can just ignore this book.  The truth is keep your reciept! Take a tack and pin the reciept and box to a bulletin board and try the product your interested in, if you don't like the result, return your products to the store.  If in 4 weeks you don't see ANY difference, it's not working for you!  But this book will simply scare you, when most products are perfectly safe without reactions

 Despite the pedigree and the weel thought out ideas of this book, most of solutions are either pie-in-the-sky or they are simply wrong.  First of all the setting is correct, America is the only super power and the world is threatened by terrorism and AIDs and gloibalizaiton is something that exists.  The prescription in this book is for America to 'lead' by cooperating and to 'fight poverty' and do lots of other do-gooder things in order to make others happy about globalization, perhaps 'solve' the AIDS problem and 'contain' dictators like Saddam.   We know from the thesis of "The Pentagons New Map" that the world is already divided into two spheres, one that 'works' and one that is disfunctional.  According to Huntingon the world is divided into 'civlizations'  This book only adds to these not mutually exclusive ideas by claiming that peaceful solutions can be found to problems and that America can use its influence, economic and political, to make others agree.  First of all, America is the new empire.  Cooperation doesnt work.  First of all, most of Europe positions itself as being 'anti-america'.  Second, Americas true ally, India, has gets little attention here.  The author, of course, denies that the main source of the worlds problems are found in that long belt that includes North Africa, the Middle East and Cnetral Asia, namely Muslim nations and those that border them.  The Democracy problem was solved  in South America, it yearns to be solved in the Middle East however this book provides no clear solutions.  Cooperation couldnt stop the Rwandan genoicde and it will do nothing to stop AIDS so long as African cultures deny it sexists, therefore cooperation is a dead letter.  America, unfortunatly, must go it alone, and those who choose to follow will be rich and happy, those who dont will be poor and undemocratic.    Besides its only a matter of time before the world ceases to be unipolar.  Seth Frantzma 
 I wasn't expecting this set of books to be smaller than a deck of cards.   Whoops, forgot to click several times and read the fine print saying they were 2" x 3".     I returned them! 
 So, poor Brooke Shields felt unhappy? So what? Is she unaware of the billions of people on this planet who live desparate lives of real poverty, who watch their children die of preventable diseases or starvation? Is she unaware of all the babies who die from malnutrition and malaria every year? And all she can do is sit in her mansion and feel sorry for herself. Of all the times in one's life, the time you are needed most is when you are a mother who has just had a baby, yet still she couldn't feel her own baby's love for her. How pathetic. I think she'd have soon changed her tune had she been marooned on a desert island after a plane crash, and she realised she could die any moment. People get 'depressed' because they spend too much time thinking, and thinking about THEMSELVES. Don't these pathetic people have anything better to do with their lives? Think of all the suffering she could prevent if she used her fame and money to do so.  She should read "Stop thinking and start living" 
 I had a friend of mine give me the cookbook as a present and I even went to Santa Fe last month and went to Harrys. Well the cookbook is nice to look at but it is not a real cookbook. More like a coffee table book. Pretty pictures and recipes that just are average. Also after going to Harrys I realize that there is really nothing special about this place but that the owner yells at his staff and the local paper identified him as hiring a lot of illegal aliens. What a disappointment 
 As a piece of entertainment, this book falls flat. Way flat.  There is a story here, but mundane sub-plots (including the love story) are thrown in in an attempt to fill the pages to make it a book.  I found myself skipping pages - lots of them - to get to the point.  Overall, very disappointing.  
 With the talent involved in this film, I had high hopes.  But there's a reason why this western can't be found on any "great westerns" or "classic westerns" list: it's not very good.  On the plus side, it has some excellent location work in and around Death Valley, some great photography and some striking imagery.  The first 30 minutes are very good.  But it goes downhill after that, with a story that falls into total predictability and ridiculousness.  It's hard to root for the outlaws, and we don't see any redeeming qualities in Gregory Peck until far too late in the story.  By then, it's hard to care.  There's actually a scene where he explains to Anne Baxter and her grandfather that he's actually a decent guy -- this despite the fact that he's robbed a bank, is willing to let one of his own men die of thirst, and plans to steal all of Baxter's and her grandfather's gold!  Yeah, right!  The final gunfight is poorly staged with no suspense, and the denouement is beyond ridiculous.  There are dozens of fine westerns on DVD, but this isn't one of them.  Technically, the transfer is very good.  For special features, there are some still galleries, trailers for other films, but no commentary 
 It was just a little over 13 months ago that Americans flushed this john and voted for leadership. We didn't buy into the lies or false claims of heroism perpetrated by Kerry and writers like Brinkley who rely on their subject for facts (fat chance)  The economy is moving well. Iraq is moving well regardless what Kerry says. This Kerry promotional piece did not work and thank God for that.  HAPPY ANNIVERSARY AMERICANS! WE ALL "FLUSHED THE JOHNS IN 2004! 
 Was happy with this toaster until I had it for about 4 months. At that time the lever started acting up by not staying down.  Sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down. Not what I expect from a $70 toaster. Well, I have finally given up (2 months later) and am sending it back to Hamilton Beach since too much time has passed to send it to Amazon. They are sending me a new one, which I am not sure I am happy about. Might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven......... 
 His central thesis has been answered by everyone from Daniel Pepes and Shabtai Teveth, to Ephraim Karsh's new book "Fabricating Israeli History". He fabricates  whole JAE speeches, mistranslates texts, and  literally concocts a "Zionist Mythology" straw man to destroy. He  fails. REad Karsh's book 
 the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointtin

 Bill Gienapp was a brilliant historian, and his work "The Origins of the Republican Party, 1852-1856" is a pillar of American political history.  Unfortunately, his final work, "Abraham Lincoln and Civil War America," is a tremendous let-down.  It is perhaps one of the worst examinations of Lincoln's life, and has almost nothing to do with "Civil War America."  Essentially, it is an unqualified love poem to Lincoln, and strives only to prove his greatness -- there is no critical analysis at all.  Lincoln is given credit for every political and military success 1861-1865 and is absolved from blame for all his mistakes.  In reality, Lincoln was a complex personality and his public career was much more tumultuous than Gienapp proposes.  It is disappointing that Gienapp, a man who dedicated his life to exhaustive, nearly flawless historical research would resort to such frivolous, uncritical "pop history" at the end of his tragically short life.  Skip Gienapp's Lincoln and, instead, read Stephen Oates's "With Malice Toward None" or Don Fehrenbacher's "Prelude to Greatness: Lincoln in the 1850s."  
 This poetry has no redemption or beauty. It is dry, sarcastic, dismal, and plain out unhealthy to the mind. It's not worth it. Read poetry that moves you to understanding, not this 
 this industry is "goin down"    u call this an album???  LO 
 I bought this book based on the reviews I read on here and I was not happy with it at all. I am a recent graduate of an advertising program and am currently completing a portfolio program. I had hoped this book would provide me with some sort of valuable insight. Unfortunately it seems to be geared toward those who know nothing about advertising at all. Much of this information is in the text book from my very first advertising class, and the rest of it belongs in a marketing text book. After buying this book Bruce came to my school as a candidate for an open teaching position. The students were not impressed with him. He is very old school. While there is a lot we can learn from people who are "old school", there is no room in this business for people who are stuck in their ways. If you are a beginner and are looking to learn a few things about advertising this may be the book for you. If not, save your 40 bucks 
 I found this book to be very boring. I bought it because I had seen it referanced in a lot of magazine articles. It may be good for looking up useful information on heart disease, but not really a preventative book. The diet recommended in this book is unrealistic to me and seems like a diet that would be recommended to a person who was diagnosed with heart disease and had to change their lifestyle 
 As an initiated priest of Palo, I can say that it depends on what house you are in whether you think this book, or any other book by Lydia Cabrera, is all that good or not. This one does have some interesting material, as do all her books. But it has plenty that is not universally agreed upon, and it has absolutely nothing at all to say about the deeper, and most important secrets of Palo. Palo is not a standardized tradition. What you know and what you do depends on what house you are coming from. The houses are secret societies. You can't expect to learn anything without being in a house. It's as simple as that. No good Palero is going to make the secrets public. By their very nature, that would be insane. Not that I am showing disrespect to Lydia Cabrera. Her books are more or less good. I like some parts of her "La Regla Kimbisa." But a word of caution to you who want to dabble with African magic: there is a lot that will never be put into writing. Dabbling, when you don't know what you are dealing with, and especially in Palo, is a very fool hardy and dangerous thing to do. You don't know what you don't know. A lot of the older Paleros question what got into Lydia Cabrera to write what she did. Palo is closed to the uninitiated 
 Having never read this author before, I did not know she was a macrobiotics enthusiast.  I just wanted some general information on improving my diet.  I'm not interested in macrobiotics.  However, in perusing the book, it seemed to be very detailed and comprehensive.  It also seemed to be very labor intensive.  If you're into macrobiotics, I guess it's a labor of love.  It just wasn't for me 
 No doubt Stewart Lee Allen was pleased with the success of "The Devil's Cup", a fine travelogue/meditation on coffee. With this book, it seems he decided to indulge himself a little, which actually turned out to be quite a lot. He attempts to display wit throughout, but for the most part Allen's wit is supercilious and sophomoric, and would to many seem to be the product of a vastly overinflated ego. In fact, "In The Devil's Garden" is laden with inaccuracies in both fact and interpretation. Simultaneously, Allen takes pleasure in virulently anti-Christian prejudices. Time and again he discusses "the Christians" as if retailing a particularly juicy piece of scandalous gossip which instead is really no more than a figment of his ignorance and over-heated literalistic imagination. But, have no fear, the author slanders all religions East and West with equal verve. This purports, after all, to be a book about food, which features in most faith traditions. To add to the horror of it all, his misuse of the English language is beyond belief. About a third of the way through I began to circle the malapropisms as if I were a high school English teacher. Two thirds through I gave up. I only finished this book to make sure it really is as bad as I thought. It was. It is a mercy to literature that "In the Devil's Garden" is out of print. R.I.P. May it never be revived.      
 And if you aren't already a fan, I can't imagine you'd be interested in this quick gloss over of Harrison's life.  Honestly, I was given this book as a present.  And I read it over two days when I was home sick.  The book is an easy read, and isn't poorly written.  It doesn't sensationalize or gossip either. Thus the second star on the rating.  But there was almost nothing in this book that I didn't already know.  It was same as watching the show "Biography".     If you need this book for your Harrison collection, then look for it in the bargain bin.  Otherwise, I'd stay away. 
 All "style" and no substance. Even the dance number with John Travolta & Uma Thurman was lackluster. And would Cedric The "Entertainer" please go away? I've never seen anything with him in it that was any good. I should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud. I think Christina Milian's voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over.  
 My 3 1/2 year old son enjoys this book, and I'll admit that the illustrations are great, but I find the text of this book lacking.  For example on page 40, the text reads: "I'm supposed to be played with," he decided"--is this even correct grammar?  The choppiness of the text, lack of flow, and overuse of exclamation points makes the story a disappointment to read 
 I was very disappointed when I opened the package from GemAvenue.  Here's why:  1.  The ear muffs are of a very LOW Quality.  Hardly worth the $14.99 GemAvenue (e4hats) charged me for it.       $0.99 would have been a fair deal.  2.  The ear muffs were advertised as being new but it had a definite "second hand" feel to it.  It reminded me        of opened merchandise from the Salvation Army Store!!!  No Joke.  In fact there were no tags on it at all to        inform me of where it was made, what it was made of, washing instructions, etc.  it did not even have the        name of the manufacturer!!!!  3.  The plastic band felt very fragile like it would break with the slightest pressure.  Adjusting the width was        nerve-racking because I had to be very careful not to break it!  4.  The "wool"(?) had a very SYNTHETIC feel to it.  Furthermore it was sparse and flat.... NOT warm and fuzzy.  I         doubt very much it is sheepskin as claimed by GemAvenue.  Besides, there was no tag to indicate that       it wasnt in fact some sort of CHEAP polyester.  5.  I tried it on and it did NOT cover my ears completely, so you can be sure its NOT going to keep my ears        warm at all.  IN CONCLUSION,  this product is NOT NEW, NOT SOFT, NOT WARM, NOT GENUINE SHEEPSKIN!!!  What more can I say?  I am just disgusted at Gem Avenue (e4hats) for selling me this rip off useless piece of JUNK!!!  I will NEVER buy anything from Gem Avenue (e4hats) EVER again!! 
 It explained very brod topics, the author goes on and on about his own experiances. I was just not pleased. Thank yo 
 This phrasebook has lots of useful grammatical information.  However, many of the examples are literal translations of the English.  The results are phrases that are not good or natural Amharic.  Instead, they teach you how to sound like a foreigner.  Though there is an Ethiopian listed as one of the authors, it is clear that he felt pressured to produce a prodcut that was close to the English 
 I've read reviews that this book is perfect for beginners and I'm at a loss to understand why.  Things are explained in high, low, fast, slow, and rarely gives an example of what specifically is meant.  The writer makes references to things that a beginning photographer, such as myself, might have the vaguest clue about without an explanation, or explanations that aren't very clear.  Bracketing is mentioned throughout the book but I'm still understand what the purpose is.  I expected clear explanations of the basics - composition, lighting, chosing a shutter speed, and choosing an aperture.  The book seems to cover each thing in little bits, then moves on.  There's approximately 40 pages (of large text) explaining everything from the different types of cameras, different types of flashes, compostition, lighting, metering, the different ways to meter (as well as the different devices), film, aperture and shutter speeds, and the many sub categories - I excluded all the pages of photographs, and much of the tip boxes since they don't really add much to what's already written on the page.  There was more information devoted to the different types of cameras then anything else.  I find the book to be almost completely useless.  It hardly expands on the manual that came with my camera 
 I am not into books that are about children being hurt or this kind of family trajedy. I did not dislike the book and I did finish it. There was a suspense that made you want to know what happened that kept me reading. It was a little too scary for me as a parent 
 I found this book to be very repetitious and containing quite a few grammatical errors.  This detracted from what could have been a wonderful story 
    Most of the songs on this album are entertaining. They have catchy hooks, a cool sound, and Johnny "Rotten" Lydon's distinctive sneering vocals. However, there are a few major problems.     For the first part, they're all basically the same song. They're pretty much all just an excessively loud brick wall of sound, which might have been interesting for a few songs, but is just repetitive and draining after a while.     Also, the songs are stretched out way too long. These could make great three minute or so songs, and than maybe PiL could put on more than eight tracks. But no. They had to stretch them into five minute long ballads that sound like they could very well just be on a loop. There is almost no variation between verse and chorus, and the volume of the music stays basically the same throughout the whole record: unnecessarily loud. This is of course with the exception of one song, "Religion", which is basically a great, big, anti-Catholic rant and a perfect example of good ol' Johnny taking himself a wee bit too seriously. To be quite frank, the whole rant reminded me of poetry that might have been written by Rick on the television show "The Young Ones". And then of course is "Religion II", which is the same song as "Religion" except with instruments in the background. Good try Johnny, but no dice. Shoulda stuck with "God Save the Queen" 
 I *love* Bach and the music selection for this video is hardly any of the best stuff he composed and so dumbed-down that it's downright bad (maybe it's not dumbed-down and the people who arranged it had a different idea for the figured-bass than most others have seen it but it still isn't appeasing to the ears). Also, like I've said in all my reviews of the composer vids, the timing is off for the vid portion and in a Bach video that's just not good. The Mozart vid is far better music wise but I suggest buying the c.d.s and forgoing the vids for this collection altogether 
 This may be the first time you hear me say this, but Go Fish was too artistic and dated for my enjoyment.  I think that if I had seen this film when it was first released back in 1994 I would have been impressed.  This was a very avant-garde film that tried very hard to discuss an issue that was very "hush-hush" back in the early 90s.  Lesbians were very closeted back then and were not a major part of the culture norm as they are today (well, as much as we recognize them today).  This makes for a very provocative film, but it also makes for a very dated film.  This was my biggest issue with this film was that it nearly felt like a comedy instead of this symbolic struggle to pursue happiness like any heterosexual relationship.  I realize that director Rose Troche was trying to show us that a lesbian relationship is no different than a male and female relationship and even lesbians talk like men talk about women, but somehow it just felt very dated and clich for me.  It didn't open more doors in my mind to the lifestyle of lesbians, but instead gave me this dated image of this butch lesbian that is rebelling against something instead of embracing the true lifestyle.  The black and white photography, while symbolically trying to show the black and white of the situation and relationship, just felt like an art film.  This was an art film, so what am I griping about?  I guess I just didn't want to see an art film with this topic.  I wanted to see something along the lines of Kids or even a documentary, not something where the uneducated will laugh at and ridicule even harder.  I wanted a film that was going to punch me in the face, not build upon dated/old clichs that instead poked my mind randomly and not very hard.  It was unimpressive.  It wasn't bold filmmaking, but instead just this random, average production about a lesbian love story.  Was it to be educational?  I think there were elements that could have been explored greater and into detail to cross that education/lifestyle acceptance line.  The scene dealing with bisexuality is the first that comes to mind.  This probably sounded great on paper, but when it was actually filmed out, it seemed high schoolish and bland.  The inner voices were not struggling with the character, but instead causing confusion and chaos that will never be resolved.  Another scene that could have played out just a bit better was the dinner scene where a group of lesbians have gathered for a party.  There could have been more discussed between the lesbians like lifestyle, issues, and current problems (that would help with the dated feel) instead of just sex, sex, and more sex.  That was a huge downfall for me was the constant reminder that all these women wanted was to have sex.  There were times when I was watching this film where I felt a bit of sweetness in my mouth because I thought there was some candy-coating happening.  This does not need to happen in a film that is supposed to bring the lesbian lifestyle closer into the spotlight.  I never felt that these women in this film were given the best light to show their stuff anyway.  From the beginning of the first scene until the last (and all those snippets in-between) all they could talk about was sex.  They wanted to have sex more often than I honestly think about in a day.  It really made the rest of the non-existent themes seem blurry and unimportant.  There was just a consistent lack of togetherness for this film that ultimately hurt it in the long run.  This wasn't a film about women's rights, but instead a dire attempt to show the similarities between homosexual and heterosexual relationships.  I agree that this happened, but just not very coherently.  There seemed to be other elements strewn together in a very loose fashion that took away from the overall power of the film.  Don't get me wrong, this could have been a very powerful film about a lifestyle that this world is still not accepting, but instead it went too far to the left (which isn't bad, except in this case) and chose to go the bleeding artist route instead of the informative, here are the facts route.  The black and white photography, the lack of character development (who really was Ely's partner?), and the cheesy moments between scenes where women talked to me about the illusive "honey pot".  It just wasn't coming together well for me and eventually fell apart all together.  Overall, I was not impressed.  There are greater films out there that express the power of the relationship and do not create this unimpressive "raw" sensation by trying to shock the audiences.  One of my favorites is the film Big Eden which accepts homosexuality like it is commonplace in society.  If Go Fish would have been done in a similar style, I think I could have walked away from the film with a better taste in my mouth.  Instead, I am stuck with an unimpressive story that did nothing except joke about why lesbian women like to play the game "Go Fish".  Ha ha ha h....it just isn't working for me.  I do not recommend this film in the least bit.  There was one, singular scene that made me chuckle and for the likes of me I cannot remember why.  It was an unmemorable feast of bad cinema.  Skip it.  Grade: * out of **** 
 Junie B.Jones came back to school and she forgot to do her home work and the teacher called her up in front and told Junie B. what she did for the weekend. I like this book because Junie B. Jones gets a serprice coming for her. I like this book because it's funny   
 After I installed this software, my Windows XP system shut down with the dreaded "blue screen of death".  I'm still trying to return my system to its former useable state!  Beware 
 STAY AWAY from this product.  The first one I got couldn't keep time properly -- on a digital clock! It was slow, and lost a lot of time.  I returned it to Target and got a new one. It had the same problem. I finally gave up and used it as it was. I never liked the super loud beeping sound it would make as you press a button, though. Too loud.  Now, the Microwave broke completely (won't run), and I'm having to send it back for a replacement 
 We purchased the GoLive software because it promised to do "everything" we could possibly want for our business website  ... we purchased the GoLive book because we needed help figuring out how to make this non-user-friendly software fufill its promises.  The book only covers the simplest of web designs and does NOT go into detail regarding anything that we require. We were very disappointed.  I would only recommend this book or software to those who want a very simple, very generic website 
 we had a heated pad for years that finally played out. it was wonderful. wanting to spend less this time than i did for the first one, i bought this item. i wish i had never put it on the bed so i could have returned it. i was suspect when i opened it. poor quality material. poor bed fit. very very warm on the lowest setting. after 3 sleepless nights of feeling the wires, which are quite large, in my ribs--it had to come off. i had rather be cold and i hate being cold 
 I purchased these shoes for my upcoming wedding because I have a hard time walking in really high heels. They are extremely cute but the satin ribbon ankle strap doesn't hold my foot firmly in the shoe. When I walked around in them, I could feel them "flopping". Also, anytime I raised my foot (to simulate my fiance taking off the garter) there was too much gap between my foot and the shoe. So, just be aware of this if you decide to purchase this shoe. For the price, this is not worth the buy 
 Bad quality, not so durable. Large burner died with 2 months of normal use. I put this product in the trasher 
 Dick Couch is a former SEAL. He loves the SEALs. This book is a good look(although limited)at modern-day SEALs. If you have never read a book about SEALs then this is an excellent place to start. This book is very informative. If you have read alot or know alot about the SEALs then skip the first 38 pages. The author really loves the SEALs. Did I mention that? On one page alone(small pages) the word SEAL is mentioned 16 times. Dick Couch is a good, not great, writer and is very detailed and I was really enjoying his book until I read his account, on page 183, of a close-quarters firefight in which he describes how good these particular SEALs could shoot because they had shot the bad guys weapon and his hands holding the weapon. This may have impressed Mr. Couch or maybe he is just trying to impress the reader, but that is not good shooting skill. This isn't an old TV western. That paragraph really made me wonder about the whole book. Fiction? Non-fiction 
 I'm a Terry Pratchett fan. I've greatly enjoyed all of the other books by him that I've read. This one, however, was disappointing. It didn't have any of the "laugh out loud" moments that make his other books so much fun to read. It was amusing, but not hilarious 
 such a waste. read Jesus' Son instead--it's amazing. this...is...the dullest thing i have ever read. my book club hates me for it. they will all get Jesus' Son for xmas 
 I've only read about 30 pages, but already I am not satisfied with it. What is this about Jesus somehow being too shy and affected by the labels given to him by those in Nazareth as the reason why He could not perform miracles there? Since when did Jesus become discouraged by what others said of him? I read this book because I am very very chronically shy to the point where I am depressed half the time, but I'm not so gullible as to be pampered by comforting words that are clearly out of line with what I think to be the true meaning of a passage. In other thoughts thus far, I think the author is trying to target too wide an audience, giving it a rather impersonal tone. I will finish it nonetheless, for hope that it bring some advice to me, but truly I think the solution for you and for me comes from a life of prayer and patience and acceptance for who God has made you and believing that He loves you 
 This book is not good. The author's style is good but the story goes nowhere.  The characters in the book are really more parodies of people rather than being fully developed.   Waste of time 
 I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious. before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the  hummus.  I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad 
 While it is true that dogs, like most mammals, including humans, can be trained by operant conditioning, Donaldson's basic premises are simply incorrect.  Her arguments that dogs can't learn except through conditioning should be obviously faulty to anyone who has spent any time with dogs.  It is true that dogs don't think exactly the way humans think, but they are certainly capable of observational learning and simple reasoning, for example.  She begins her discussion by contrasting Skinnerian behaviorist notions (which were also incorrect in their basic premises) with the strawman of the "Disney" view of animals.  She's not willing to take on serious recent studies which give real insight into how animals think, feel, and behave.  The interested reader might want to check out "Animal Minds" by Douglas Griffin. Or much older, long underrated books by Charles Darwin and George Romanes, for that matter. Skinnerian behaviorism is headed for the garbage bin of obsolete theories. And there are also far more enlightened dog training books, by people who are in touch with more modern ideas about how animals behave.  The choice isn't Skinner or Disney.    If you really were to believe, with Donaldson, that dogs are nothing more than mindless, always greedy automata, why would you ever want to live with one?  Luckily, she's wrong 
 This is a very bad book once you get past your self-conscious fear that you are missing something--I would say an alarmingly bad book: one has to wonder why this manuscript was submitted, and if submitted, not edited. This turns into a repetition of the allusive and graceful, for sure,  but unsubstantiated shtick of the by-now facile co-mingling of forms and genres, made even weaker by a lack of discipline to corral digressive discursions and courage to present arguments in at least occassionally straightforward logical presentation--this is all riffing on material we've seen before and it repeats and repeats and repeats itself. Yes, we can treat "Yahweh" as a purely literary-textual rather than an embedded national-cultic figure whose text was never naked and whose narrative was never uninstantiated in an actual religious-national culture (itself progentive but not, as a culture, textual-canonical), and compare this to the figure of "Jesus Christ as God" and then, propose a Gnostic trope of Yahweh's self-shrinkage in internally distancing (and neurotic) "zimzum."  Presumably we could also describe quantum mechanics in a poetical fashion and discourse freely on the feline qualities of Schrodinger bifurcated cattiness vis a vis the solid roundness of Newtonian physical matter--except we would be missing what was substantive and unique about the actual subject matter.   I will let Christians decide whether the oft-repeated and repeated remark that Jesus Christ is not Yahweh is meaningful or provocative for them; as a semi-agnostic Jew I would agree that Christianity has not supplanted Judaism and that Judaism will and must always attempt to define itself on its own terms. Still, I must wonder what this observation, when it comes for the second, fifth, and tenth time, actually tells us about the plurality of Second Commonwealth Judaisms, the full Gestalt of "Yahwehism" throughout patriarchal, Rabbinic, and mystical literature, or, indeed, the "Jewishness" of classic Christian doctrinal claims in an age where very Orthodox Jews (who do, it is true, practice the Law) now freely confess to belief in a dead Messiah, who will be resurrected, and who, many declare, is "the essence of God in a body".  Moreover, the second-and-third hand derived picture of kabbalah, most particularly the poetical post-Kafkaesque elaboration on the meaning and emotional import of "Yahweh's" zimzum is a debilitatedly reductionist and misleading summation for the reader of the contextual placement and import of zimzum and shvirat keliim within the rich panoply of inter-related Lurianic symbology as understood through its oral and written expositors. Just as Hamlet really is not Yeshua and Bloom's Yahweh is an over-familiarized and sized down version of the theophononic and hieraphantic Yahweh-Adonoi-El of Jewish tradition and practice, so is his Yahweh of zimzum an over angst-compressed shoebox size misimpression of the Divine Structure of actual Lurianic kabbalah 
 Hoping for an exciting read with this, my first Lee Child mystery.  Unfortunately you don't always get what you hoped for.  Every aspect of this story is poorly thought out.   I'm as willing as the next person to suspend reality for the sake of an exciting storyline, but this is too implausible to be ignored.  Buy a John Sandford novel instead.  
 I love Columbo.  I have seasons 1, 2, 3 and 4.  Season three is the only set on double sided DVDs as far as I can tell. It freezes and locks up on all my DVD players in the house. This needs to be made into a 4 disk set.  Universal should redo this season and give everyone a swap out.  This should be like a recall with no questions asked.  If I had to do it over I would not buy the third season.  With all that said, the episodes are just great 
 About the only thing this album is worth is the inclusion of the original mixes of Boyz N Tha Hood and Dope Man. They aren't that drastically different than the versions that appeared on Eazy-Duz-It and Straight Outta Compton. There is also the lame clean version of 8-Ball (NOT the original song, but a clean, radio version, which is only interesting in that it was on the D.O.C's "It's Funky Enough". This hodge-podge was thrown together by Macola more-or-less to make some money off of NWA, whose future at that point was up in the air because Ice Cube was off at college. The songs came from the "Boyz" 12", the "Panic Zone" 12" and were rounded out by D.O.C.'s Fila Fresh Crew and the song "Scream" by Rappinstine, which was later replaced by "A Bitch Iz A Bitch" when Ruthless got the rights back to this album in 1989. (That song was originally on the Express Yourself 12" and is now a bonus track on "Straight Outta Compton" as well).  This is interesting more or less for historical purposes, but there's nothing on really that's all that important. Aside from the original mixes of "Boyz" and "Dope Man", this is for die-hards only. The rest is 2nd rate typical early/mid 80's generic rap, which gives no indication of what would follow. 
 The book was interresting but  I find it interesting that the club referred to in the book is ony for peopole making 6 figures.Do they realy need the basic exercises that are in this book? I thought this was for people fresh out of school or those choosing careers far from their area of experience 
 I was very upset that this book was geared towards Christians.  Nowhere on the front or back cover did the book mention that the book would include quotes from the bible, tips for abstaining from sex before marriage and how to maintain a close relationship with God.  I am an atheist!  This is more than a little misleading...frankly, I was very offended that the authors would just assume that everyone who picks up a book about relationships subscribes to Christian beliefs.  For that reason, I'm only giving it one star.  Luckily, I got the book from a library, but if I had paid for it I'd be very unhappy.  That said, if a religious guide to dating is what you're looking for, you may like this book.  It does have some good suggestions to offer, and I like how each chapter had a summary list of important points.  This is great for a quick review of each chapter.  
 This book appears to be the " book" from "MUSIC MAN  from the way it is listed.  It is not however.  It consists of songs from the show with melody line only printed in extra large notes. Each note contains  the name of the pitch writen inside.  It is only marginally useful as a  teaching tool for children and is defintely not what it appears to be in  the Amazone Catalogue! 
 If you're interested in the basis for the Food Enzyme Concept, you will be better off with the original, Dr. Edward Howell's book, "Food Enzymes for Health and Longevity." Santillo's book is an enthusiastic abstract  of some of the highlights of Dr. Howell's work, but the details got a  little scrambled in translation 
 This book has beatiful photographs - that's about it.  The directions are poor and you cannot see the entire finished  jewelry piece.  This should have been a coffee table book. 
 This is not a fun book to read. It's like an old textbook in a community  college. It's okay, and it's worth reading, but it's not worth the money.  You won't gain 15 bucks of information in this book. If you want to know  about independent filmmaking buy Rick Schmidt's Feautre Filmmaking at  Used-car prices. This is well worth the read and the money 
 I am a graduate student in organizational development.  Although this book has some good underlying concepts, I found most of the book hard to follow and not very engaging.  It was often difficult to see how many of the concepts actually apply to organizations.  There may be good ideas, but they often get lost in the rambling chapters 
 Overall, this book was a mildly interesting, quick read, probably suitable for a weekend around the house.   I found myself, however, mildly fatigued due to the awkwardly strung together facts, as if they were simply plucked from their sources and placed on paper with a minimum of effort.   Unfortunately, except for a few points, any information in this book isn't "new" and could probably be found, with some effort, in encyclopedia's, National Geographic, etc.   In my opinion, I would be willing to pay as much as seven dollars for this book, however, not the publisher's price, demanded by such obvious esoteric subject matter 
 Most of the material in this book is obvious, trivial, or both. Whatever is left has been better covered even in "starter" career books like What Color Is Your Parachute.  I bought this together with several other career change books, including Is Your Genius at Work (Dick Richards), Working Identity (Herminia Ibarra), Finding Your North Star (Martha Beck), and Do What You Are (Paul & Barbara Tieger). I Don't Know What I Want was the only disappointment. The assessment section is a joke, while the advice for individuals with different motivations to change careers appears to be written at an introductory level more suitable to somebody who's starting their first career (in which case see my comment above about What Color Is Your Parachute). All the other books I've mentioned provide either an in-depth method of self-assessment helpful in developing a plan of action, or information about the job search process that hasn't been published in popular magazines; some of them provide both.  It's not worth the bother to return it, but I don't see myself keeping it around or recommending it to friends 
 On the back cover of this book, we learn that "terrorists and hostages forge unexpected bonds . . . Friendship, compassion, and the chance for great love lead the characters to forget the real danger that has been set in motion . . . and cannot be stopped." The characters may indeed forget, but Patchett's constant foreshadowing of ultimate tragedy ensures that you never will.  To be sure, this book isn't all bad. Writing about the shared humanity between hostages and terrorists isn't a bad thing, and some of the characters manage to be entertaining at times. But Patchett seems to think that this theme is too subtle for readers to understand unless they are bludgeoned with it on every page. Hence, nothing in this book is subtle: one of the child terrorists turns out to be a fantastic and passionate chess player; another is a brilliant opera singer. One wonders if Patchett thinks that we would miss anything less over-stated.  Her handling of the child terrorists in general is also inept. We learn early on that "if [these children] had been living in a different country, in an entirely different life, [they] might still have gone out trick-or-treating." But Patchett seems to frequently forget that these children ARE coming out of an entirely different background, filled with political and economic desperation. Hence, she writes about them as if they are all recently transplanted Americans, with all of the accompanying childish tricks and lack of seriousness. Her larger theme-- the common humanity of characters from such different and seemingly incompatible backgrounds-- is difficult to take seriously when said backgrounds are drawn so unconvincingly.  Finally, Patchett's book lacks any real plot structure. The characters are thrown together early on, and her constant foreshadowing leaves no doubt as to the book's tragic conclusion. Since no major events happen in between, this book essentially consists of a long series of often unrelated vignettes about the characters' harmless interactions. You could skip almost any chapter and not miss any of the book's theme or plot. The ending, when it finally does come, has no surprises or emotional impact. One of the major hostages dies, but his death has the feel of an afterthought, hastily written in and not dwelled upon at all.  Patchett's inept characters and almost nonexistent plot make Bel Canto a largely harmless, occasionally amusing, and completely forgettable book. 
 I ordered this video with a great deal of excitement beacause it promised a lot and had a lovely woman on the cover.  When I played it for the first time I was very disappointed for three reasons:  1)  Nearly all of the moves require a specific type of chair.  If you do not own this type of chair in your home, you are out of luck.  Even if you had the right type of chair, I doubt these techniques would be comfortable anyhow.  2)  The narration is very poor.  They try to get you into a relaxed state, but their voices (man and woman) are more annoying than soothing or relaxing.  In addition, the guy is a hippie with a ponytail.  If he was on the cover, I would have not bought the video.  3)  The man and the woman are both somewhat flabby (the woman is still very attractive though).  Most instructors on these types of DVD's are nicely toned and pleasing to look at for inspiration.    Overall, the biggest disappointment was knowing that I needed a special chair to do these movements with.  If I would have known that, the DVD I bought would still be in the Amazon.com warehouse.  Good luck to those of you that still decide to order this video after reading what I wrote.  You're going to need it! :)  BB& 
 That's how I felt the whole time I was reading this book. I loved The Sixth Sense, really liked Unbreakable, sorta liked Signs, and hated The Village. When Lady in the Water came out, I really didn't have any desire to see it. However, when I saw this book in the library, I have to admit that I was intrigued. As a writer, I'm always curious as to how others go through the writing process. What drives them? A peek into a creative mind like Shyamalan's was too much too resist.  I  wish I had.  Others have written that Shyamalan comes off as egocentric. I didn't get that sense so much. He's a visionary who couldn't get everyone to buy into his vision. Whether or not his vision was one worth pursuing . . . well, I think anyone who reads this book or sees the movie will know how to answer that.  However, the problem for me wasn't the subject. It was the author. Bamberger was simply not the right person to pen this tale. I really don't know much about the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster, and apparently, neither does Bamberger. He provides little or no insights throughout the text. I think that a good, seasoned writer could have done something with this story. Instead, we got 270-some pages of nothing special.  After reading this book, I went back and read Roger Ebert's review of Lady in the Water. He wrote something in there that was interesting. He said the movie was all tell and no show. I felt the book was much the same way. Bamberger continually tries to get away with just telling us the facts, as opposed to showing us how the story unfolded. As a result, the narrative is dry, and incredibly uninteresting, considering the subject matter.  All in all, I'd definitely pass on this book 
 If your left - handed this book is NOT for you. I thought a lot of the projects were to advanced for beginners. 
 I was surprized to find that The Yeast Connection left me feeling disappointed.The lay out of the material is less than "handy" and the overall flow of the information that could be helpful to someone setting up a cleansing program is irratically placed through out the book. I also purchased the Yeast Connection Cookbook and was horrified to find the author supplying alternative meat sources such as hippopotamus,lion and giraffe. What's up with that? Have they lost their minds 
 The story is cute.  But I can't figure out how to get the buzzing sound to work every time.  My daughter loves that it buzzes and she wants me to make it work, but, it comes on only sometimes.  Its not worth the effort to return it.  I don't recommend buying it 
 Why do some white kids like hip hop?  probably the same reasons why children have tried to shock their parents for ages. Hip hop (what a name)is the product of cultural nihilism, a direct result of the black underclass which seeks to return to the "good old days" of blaming whitey. After all it's whitey who told us are BAD-so Bad we will act. So there you have it, instead of Black Americans working hard to become successful, many prefer to follow a congo beat while fondling their fake bling-bling while watching underclothed women gyrate their rotund bodies.   Those writers who claim that hip-hop is another culture whites want to steal are delusional at best. When I'm stopped at a stoplight and the car next to me is shaking with a loud bass, all I can think of is: "thank God I lack their culture"!       But let's think about this! Remember the days when the world "culture" actually meant something. If one studies the culture of the Greeks or Romans we see a the long history of a particular society. A history built on art, language, law, philosophy, religion,music,  architecture and myth.  Hilarious enough, the so-called hiphop culture began with a myth:"the myth that poor latinos and blacks created hiphop out of nothing: (this was a direct quote from a misguided latina at an education conference at UNC.     And the myth continues, according to another site, the author claims that hiphop is instrumental in making social/cultural changes in the larger society.   A recent hiphop conference (pretending to be a political entity) presented the (world),or at least their "hood" with a list of demands, including full reparations for blacks, free education, free health care, all in a beligerant and hostile "gimme" tone.     The angry person who referred to me as an idiot may need to remember the words of the rapper Tony Yayo who raps:" I'm in that brand new range:when I pull up, kid, I turn your brains into red concrete stains."  I ask you-and others-is this a culture-or is it verbal poison?    
 I found this book to be very boring. I bought it because I had seen it referanced in a lot of magazine articles. It may be good for looking up useful information on heart disease, but not really a preventative book. The diet recommended in this book is unrealistic to me and seems like a diet that would be recommended to a person who was diagnosed with heart disease and had to change their lifestyle 
 The item is fine.  It was the wrong DC adaptor for the Garmin unit purchased.  It was listed along the Garmin unit as the correct one for the unit.  It was for another Garmin line of products.  I'm sure it worked well on the correct product 
 This is a fun film and one of the few from the period where Jet just seems to have some fun and go off. But this is a pretty sorry release for it. So Tai Seng is releasing widescreen laser disc masters again? Niiicccee. Wait for a better release. At least that one might not have a Ric Meyers commentary on there. If there's a sure sign of a lack of care from a company releasing kung fu films, it's Meyers' name anywhere on the product. 
 i loved all of the previous books by Alexander McCall Smith and looked forward to each new one, although the frequency of publications does make one question if his writing has turned into a pure money producing scheme. However this novel failed to develop Isabel in the manner that I have always viewed her character and has became superficial. To end as this does seems extrordinarily superficial to meet a mass market view of society, and reminds me of the second movie in the 'Back to the Future.' This novel destroyed Isabel for me. mar 
 As a long time fan of Nicholas Sparks, I was a little disappointed in this book.  The potential for it to be a great story faded when it became about these two characters and nothing more.  The entire book takes place in this little Bed and Breakfast and lacks the support of any minor characters.  There just wasn't enough going on in this book to keep my attention.   Sparks's writing is beautiful as usual, but the plot for this story just didn't impress me the way his other stuff did.  If you are looking for a great Nicholas Sparks read, try The Rescue 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 Curiously, though the event has rated an HBO documentary, a made-for-TV movie, and a full-blown theatrical retelling, the complete story of the "Miracle on Ice" has never been put between covers in a real, live book (as opposed to a tome of the "instant paperback" variety).  Unfortunately, it still hasn't.  Coffey does a good enough job of telling the only story that people seem to care about anymore - the February 22, 1980, shocker that the U.S. hockey team pulled off against the unbeatable Soviets - but he reproduces each and every hockey movement of the game to such an excruciating degree that it's all the harder to forgive him for paying scant attention to the rest of the games that the Americans played to cop the gold.  The interstitital mini-biographies of the various players and Coach Herb Brooks (whose 2003 funeral following a fatal car crash serves as the book's curtain-raiser) break the game narrative up to the point that the book is a bit confusing to read.  It's an OK effort, but "Do You Believe in Miracles?" (the HBO documentary) and "Miracle" (the Disney feature flick) remain the best reminiscences of this epochal moment in sports history 
 I bought this book after hearing the author talk on C-Span "Book  Notes".  She seemed intelligent and well-spoken. I was surprised to find her writing was not up to her oratory.  The book reminded me of term papers written by high school students- occasional flashes of insight, never properly developed, surrounded by uninspired verbiage. Chapters were subdivided into alternate views: "Winston Churchill Was Well Suited to High Office" and "Winston Churchill Was Ill Suited to High Office".  After only a few paragraphs, the section would end with   lines right out of high school debate class "It was for these qualities that Churchill was hailed as the savior of his country," or "Because of these qualities, Churchill was an irresponsible and erratic leader."  The only redeeming quality is the character of Churchill, that manages to still come through despite the very immature style of writing 
 The author pledges that, by using this book, in a couple of month you may be mistaken for a Greek god or goddess, page 113.  Like a con artist, who buys a bottle of aspirin from a 99-cent store and tries to sell you each tablet of aspirin for a dollar, promising you that that would solve all your health problems, the author experiences a frenzy of publishing deceitful brochures, each contains few flawed exercises and crammed with endless tales about the evil empire (41 only in this book).   The book is jammed with untraceable citations attributed to professors John Jakicic, Janda, and Vladimir Zatsiorsky, doctors Judd Biasiotto, Garrick, Fred Hatfield, and Fred Clary, experts Vladimir Janda, Jrgen Hartmann and Harold Tnnemannoffered, Ori, and scientist Igor Sukhotsky. While the book title refers to abdominal muscles, you will find only one  reference to `transversus abdominis' on, page 90, and one reference to the `internal oblique' muscle.  There is no reference to key words such as `cardiac', `pulmonary', `venous', `inspiration', or `congestion', which you would expect to find in a book that is dedicated to abdominal development.    That explains why the author, on page 110, does not recognize the meaning of `upper' and `lower' abs.  Though the author admits, in his dedication of the book to his parents, that he is not a rocket scientist, nevertheless he believes that it were easy to become a fitness expert by just browsing through medical books. In page 110, the author mistakens the anatomy of the abdomen by stating that "the rectus abdominis muscle is the only muscle that constitute the abs" and that "there are no upper or lower abs". He thus does not recognize the different and wide origins and insertions of the oblique and transverse muscles that constitute the lateral support of the abdominal pouch, in the upper and lower parts of the abdomen.  Here, he states: "No matter where you attach the load to your torso or your legs, you will train the entire length of the abdominal muscle".  That is an erroneous analysis of anatomical function, because the oblique and transverse muscles could be loaded with mere torso twisting apart from stretching the rectus abdominis muscle.   The author's flawed understanding of health, anatomy, and physiology issues caused him to make some dangerous mistakes:  (1)	On page 110, the author advises "getting used to neck bothering" during abdominal workout without realizing the need for warm-up and progressive incremental strengthening of the neck muscles to avoid cervical disc herniation or nerve pinching.    (2)	On page 107, the author prescribes a bizarre exercise that could not be explained in relation to any abdominal strengthening. The one-arm deadlift as a workout of the oblique abdominis is berserk. The author recommends buying a 300-pound barbell for that purpose, while his picture of performing the deadlift indicates his unfamiliarity with the mechanics of lifting. Neither his thighs are well developed, nor are his trapezius, which are characteristic signature of any significant training on the deadlift.    (3)	On page 101, the author defends his approach of `heavy load with few repetition', against `light and high repetition', by suggesting that heavy tension increases muscle tone while high reps increases lactic acid production. He bases that on his understanding of `Myofibrillar hypertrophy' (page 47 in his book `Power to The People') versus `Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy'. Here, in that latter reference, he admits that he has no respect to `Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy' because it leads to a lot of vasculature and fluids in the muscle. The truth is that successful training must balance strength and endurance by planning periods of high repetitions for fat burning and endurance and periods of heavy strengthening for advancing strength. The author's claim that heavy loading with few reps is superior to the other modality contradicts his claim in his book `The Russian Kettlebell Challenge' that 40 to 100 lifts of the 32 kg ball will lead to ultimate strength.    (4)	The author claims that this book will teach you both `isolation' and `integration' of the abdominal muscles. He then describes few of the commonly used abdominal exercises you will see in any mediocre gym. The leg raises (6 pictures), the sit-ups (11 pictures), the Swill Ball crunches (3 pictures), the wheel Jackknife pushups (22 pictures) all emphasize the rectus abdominis muscle. When it comes to the oblique abdominal muscles, the author describes another bizarre `full contact twist with bar' that has very little to do with the obliques. The Saxon side bends is the only exercise that reasonably emphasizes the obliques.  Thus, the book ignores all torso-twisting exercises that strengthen the lower abdominal fibers of the oblique and transverse abdominal muscles.           Instead of distorting your knowledge about anatomy, physiology, and fitness, and draining your wallet on these deceitful publications, you could do yourself a favor by running few miles and attending local gyms where you meet many talented instructors on endurance, yoga, and general strength training.   
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 This is a pure Rip-Off from the cover of Aerosmith's Live Bootleg album from 1978...Where's the shame? Too bad Twilight are not original enough to come up with their own cover.  In another words, this DVD is pretty suck and the originality here is nowhere to be found...Especially on the cover art that they stole from a much bigger band. 
 People were talking about this movie as if it were the next Silence Of The Lambs.  There are several reasons why this is not so.  1. The Dumbest Cop In The World:  This character never calls for backup, and is too slow to think of the most obvious clues.  At the end, he even throws down his gun to have a fist fight.  He'd never survive on the Sopranos. 2. It's sooooooo 1998.  This movie assumes you know nothing about the internet.   3. It tries to be cool by combining BDSM, body modification, and rituals, but in the end it just makes all these things look bad. 4. It's inconsistent.  The Dee Snider character "retires" all his piercings for a few years, and then suddenly they're all back in the next scene.   5. It's unrealistic.  Where the heck did Snider get that second dungeon from in just a day? 6. I won't even get into the gaping plot holes.  The acting, pretty bad.  The dumbest cop in the world character has just one mood:  Grumpy.  Amy Smart is totally wasted in this movie.  Snider's pretty good though.  Actually he's really good.  Really, bottom line:  You have only two reasons to buy this movie. 1. You are easily entertained and you have no problem with plot holes so big you can drive a Twisted Sister tour bus through them with room to spare. 2. You're a Snider fan and you must own this.  If you belong to one of those two groups, go for it.  For Sister fans, they'll enjoy how the movie roughly follows the plot of the song Captain Howdy/Street Justice.    You've been warned!  
 This a great concept of a book, but the scholarship, prose, and editing are all shoddy. Some facts are flat-out wrong, dates often have transposed numbers, entries are repetitive.   Some of the entries are misrepresentative of censorship trends. For example, there is an entry on Voltaire's "Candide." However, the only time "Candide" was ever censored (as far as my research can tell) is once in the 1930s when one shipment of French copies was stopped in American customs because of the pictures. So it's the *artwork* which was being censored, not the novel. Additionally, much of Voltaire's work WAS actively censored, both during and after his lifetime, but Karolides and crew fail to mention that.  My college Censorship Honors Seminar course used this book as a textbook and we spent most of our time wondering if the editor was asleep while proofing the text. It was horrid 
 Disclaimer:  I have only been able to sample Professor Butz's work.  I looked at those portions of particular interest to me.  I read what he had to say about Jewish demographics, that is, the number of Jews in Europe before and after the Second World War.  I also looked at what he had to say about the Wannsee Conference of January 1942, at which the Germans, according to the standard historians, decided on the Holocaust. I was also interested to see how he evaluated the Nuremberg trials of the top Nazi leaders.    On population figures, Professor Butz will not accept any data from Jewish or "Communist" (i.,e. Soviet) sources, since, he says, such sources are tainted.  Jews and Communist lie, according to Professor Butz, so why listen to them.  On the Wannsee Conference, he quotes the Nazi sources that speak of Nazi plans to deport all of Europe's Jews and to enslave them.  But since these Nazis did not spell out an intention to kill all Jews in so many words, Professor Butz finds that, therefore,  this source is reliable evidence for his proposition that no such killings took place.  In Professor Butz's book, moreover,  whoever says that he has witnessed the Holocaust is a liar.    On the Nuremberg trials, he finds that any incriminating statements by Nazis to have been extorted by cruel and sadistic Allied guards.  Professor Butz's work gives evidence of great industriousness.  He has many footnotes and supplies many figures and pictures.  Such apparatus has been taken as a sign of deep scholarship by his friends and supporters.  But his analysis of all these data is simple:  whatever supports his thesis is accepted, whatever contradicts it is called a lie.  But unfortunately for Professor Butz,  it is quite impossible to accept his thesis without also accepting his notion of the Jews.  He sees Jews of all stripes -- from the most Zionist to folks like Noam Chomsky -- as united in a vast conspiracy to dupe the non-Jewish world.  Moreover, in order to accept Professor Butz's work, we must also accept that this Jewish conspiracy, this "Hoax" as he calls it, was also uncritically accepted by all the professional historians who have worked in this area.  Everyone is a dupe, everyone, that is, except he himself and his handful of friends.    Is that plausible ?  I don't think so.  
 This book is awful.  It has terrible explanations and few examples.  The math is very unclear.  If you are an instructor, please use a different book 
 Very bad book! This book, like all the books in the Trotter-Mathematica series is a excellent example of how not to write a good technical book. Presentation of material and ideas do not flow and he makes simple things more complex than they really are by virtue of his inability to communicate ideas in the most direct way. Many good authors have written books on Mathematica such as Bahder or Ruskeepaa. It would have been better if they had written this book as well 
 This frame was purchased as a gift by a group of us for our babysitter. The idea was great but the frame wasn't. It was difficult to operate and the instructions were difficult to understand. She sent it back and bought one she loves from Sam's Warehouse. 
 The book seems to be well written, however one reason I purchase computer books is to go through the examples and actually get the source code to compile. There's an unanswered enty in the Apress forum from July asking if anyone could get the source to compile. As I said it's not answered so apparently no one else could get the source to compile either. As I said in the forum if authors would simply include a jar file with the source this problem would not exist. Since the author used eclipse to generate the examples and since it's a simple mouse click in eclipse to do this, it must be laziness on the authors part. I'll change my rating once (if) the source code compiles 
 I did not like it. It is a bad story. Wolfs are not bad like in the story. Peter doesnt listen to his grandpa, so it is a bad example 
 The Quiet Earth is overrated for a variety of reasons that will be discussed below. This movie is not the epic, thought-provoking, intelligent sci fi I was led to believe it was. It's actually very overrated, and fans of intelligent sci fi such as 2001 or Primer will likely be very disappointed. The first 30 minutes or so are jaw-dropping. I was really getting geared up for what I was sure was going to become one of my all-time favorites. The scenes of Bruno standing above the wrecked passenger jet, driving around a mall, the sun rising to the haunting score--all unforgettable. The scenes where Bruno starts to lose it, running around in a slip brandishing a shotgun, setting up cardboard figures of celebrities and pretending he's their ruler, giving them speeches (That's why I deserve to be President...of the quiet earth...I've been condemned to live) are all great. After this point the movie starts to disintegrate, and quickly. The female character is highly irritating, so much so that I think I would have ditched her and looked for other survivors. Api is also highly irritating, and when the film veers away from its central mystery and starts devolving into yet another film about a petty love triangle--my thumbs were pointing down, way down.   Something needs to be said about the ending of this film. So many people have said that it's "deep." How is it "deep?" How is it deep when it's just a gimmicky way to quickly wrap a rather dodgy film that really doesn't have anything to say? Let's examine this. Many people argue the following (and if they were correct the film would've been much better than it was): The main character is a scientist who convinces himself that Project Flashlight resulted in "the effect" (even though others here insist on calling it "the event") which made everyone else disappear. The main characters come to believe that "the effect" didn't snatch them up too because they were died right when it happened. But what if there isn't any "effect" at all? What if these are just three people who died and then went to another earth where there aren't any people? The scientist then convinces himself that "the effect" is going to happen again, and, understandably fed up with the fact that the only other two people on earth are a bonkers, daffy, annoying woman and a nutty, homicidal maniac, decides to basically kill himself while blowing up the satellite for Project Flashlight. He dies again and ends up on another world, one which this time doesn't even resemble earth. The end. It would have been very clever if this was what was going on, if there really wasn't an "effect" at all and if the three protagonists had just happened to go to the same place when they died. Unfortunately, all the critics saying "they went to another earth where everyone else was gone" are forgetting something: the dead bodies! I know there aren't a lot, but remember, there's the radiation burn guy in the science station, and there's the dead guy on the hood of his car, and the dead woman holding a CB radio, etc. If they went to another earth where life was absent, why are there dead people? The real answer is that this movie was not very well thought out, that it doesn't make sense, and that the ending is just a cheap and easy way to try and appear impressive. According to the people who worked on the film, "the effect" obviously did occur, and what happens at the end is that when the scientist tries to kill himself a second time he dies, again, at the exact moment that "the effect" occurs a second time. So at the end, "the effect" does occur a second time, which means the girl and Api are history, and the scientist, as he again dies when "the effect" occurs, moves on one more time. Another point that is made in the DVD commentary is that the film was made by a Catholic, so the obvious purgatory then heaven tripe comes to mind.    Also highly irritating is that for a scientist, the main character is not very smart. He laments that he's the last person on earth and then he runs into a nutty woman. They find a nutty guy named Api and then the three of them conclude they're the last three people on earth! What?! Are they totally daft? A scientist would quickly reason that if there were three people within such a small region of the same city then there are probably other people in the city, more people than that throughout the rest of New Zealand, and even more people in bigger places such as America, Europe, and Asia. That his first conclusion is always that "they're the only ones" only demonstrates his stupidity. They come to believe that they all died at the same time, right when "the effect" occurred, and that that's why they remained on earth. Well, if three people died at the exact same time in the same city in tiny New Zealand, then many, many other people must've died at that time throughout the rest of the massive world. 
 Esquire is a subpar Men's magazine, in my opinon.  More than half of the magazine is advertisements, and when you finally get to the articles they are rarely entertaining and/or thought-provoking.  If you like ads and cologne samples, pick it up.  After all, it is pretty decently priced 
 The book offers a good synopsis of PCOS. However there are overly technical details (reference chapter 2 regarding types of blood tests, etc.) which pad the pages and make for unuseful reading to the lay person. The book comes across as more of a work in progress rather than a serious paper on the topic. Items are repetitive throughout which again appears as page-padding. Mention is made of one particular subject that was to appear later on in the text (i.e. how PCOS will impact on your female fetus) however, this never materialises. The author clearly has a passion for the subject, but unfortunately the text is poorly articulated. 
 Apparently this is one of those "cult" movies that has a small but dedicated following, even though most people have never heard of it. Nothing wrong with that, but be aware that the reviews you'll read here are from a VERY skewed sample of movie fans. I love good comedy, and so does my wife, but both of us found this movie terminally dull. It's basically a one-joke movie -- the joke being that the people in it (the characters, not the actors) are totally untalented, but also totally oblivious to that fact. So they just keep on doing their unfunny bits.   "Waiting for Guffman" does not appear on the American Film Institute's list of 100 Funniest Movies. Nor is it on the IMDB list of 50 Top Comedies, as rated by thousands of movie fans. So anyone who tells you this movie is the "funniest movie ever" or "hilarious" is definitely out of the mainstream.  I'll give Guest and his usual crew credit for doing something a bit off the beaten path. The improv/mockumentary format has the potential to be funny, but in this mess of a movie, it doesn't work very well. There are some funny bits (David Cross is always a stitch) but too much of it just falls flat. It feels like something that would have worked on SNL as a 10-minute sketch, but as a full-length movie it just CRAWLS.   OK, I've said my piece -- and I'm sure that I'll get lots of "not helpful" ratings from the movie's rabid fans who make up the majority of the folks that will check out this title. But if you're not a fan of slow, dry, improvisational movies, be warned: you won't find "Waiting for Guffman" very amusing 
 I've read nearly every one of Danielle Steel's vast collection of novels...and this is "hands down" the VERY WORSE piece of garbage she's ever written.  What a joke!  It was as if one of Ms Steel's enemies broke into her house and forced her to write this mess!  Don't bother 
 I thought that this book would be more interactive. Better (and more creative) to draw your own family tree 
 I would not recommend this book to anyone unless they are looking for a non-realistic cutsie book to pass the time.  The book starts with a good premise: what the elaborate ritual of college admissions really tells about a person and who he or she is.  However, the story gets lost with odd twists, turns, and irrelevant plot lines.  This poorly written maze of a book about nothing isn't exactly written for teens as it heavily focuses on the emotions of the stress of parents sending their children away.  There are some mildly amusing parts as Dylan goes through various college interviews.  However, most of these situations are cliché and predictable.  The more unintentional amusing parts of this book is watching the author, James Finney Boylan, attempt to create characters that talk like modern day teenagers.  Someone should tell this guy no one calls each other "dickweed" or "dude" in every sentence.  Another thing that is annoying is that he writes like he is still in junior high.  One may notice he shifts from the narrator talking in first person to third person at various points.  He also used convoluted vocabulary in an attempt to add some sort of depth to the writing.  So if you are really bored, there may be some humorous things in this book to read, mostly unintentional 
 I don't know what happened but this album needs to be slept on. This dude keeps rappin' about where he's from and junk like that. It's like he doesn't have anything else to say. While the production may be okay (it's questionable)the lyrics just plain suck. Hey Fiend give Dr. Dre a call 
 Edward R. Murrow was a giant of a man and more than just the liberal hero of felling Sen. Joseph McCarthy (who went overboard on a very real problem of Communism in the US - see books on Venona), which takes up much of this small book.   In actuality, Murrow was a rare quality of a man that shined for a bright moment amidst much darkness. His notion of fairness and character is better addressed in A.M. Sperber's "Murrow: His Life and Times" (read p. xi and following). Although, the best contemporary view of those times - to be neutral - is now found wanting, as no one is neutral - although he was exemplar regarding fairness, even when he went to defend his associate Laurence Duggan (p. 99), who was not only a KGB informer, but in fact, a KGB agent (this wasn't known to the public until after Murrow's death). Nevertheless, Murrow was a man who stuck to his guns and his character and redefined journalism (earlier journalism had a "yellow" reputation since the 19th century). My father had worked with him in the 1950s at CBS and told us that he was down to earth and a solid person. He was the ultimate gravitas statesman of journalism. He was not so easy to categorize, which journalism since the Watergate era has done in political terms (when the media was redefined by the Bernstein / Woodward team at the Washington Post - decidedly with a left bent).  Bob Edwards, who has hosted "Morning Edition" on NPR, writes briefly on Murrow and tends to mold him in the image of a contemporary liberal media hagiography, but never really shows the depth of his character and the times that were (again, see Sperber).  In his afterward, Edwards comments on the devolution of broadcast journalism. His most telling paragraph is when he writes: "If there's a Murrow now among young journalists, he or she will probably leave the business before arriving at a position that gets our attention. If that person shares Murrow's background and training, he or she likely will end up as the president of a small college, enjoy the work, and know the names of every freshman's parents. That would be a very good thing and we should not necessarily mourn the loss of such an individual on a bigger stage" (p. 165).  Another outstanding journalist of that era to research was the Chicago-based Clifton Utley.  I still remember those great weekend days when my father would listen with memory to "Edward R. Murrow - A Reporter Remembers, Vol. 1: The War Years, 1939-1946", those London broadcast recordings of Murrow starting with the memorable line, "This is London". He would start his later broadcasts with a similar focused-styled phrasing that captured the imagination and hearts of people everywhere. 
 My wife gave me this book for my birthday this year, and it's the first time I've ever been disappointed by a gift from her.  I read 75 pages of this before I couldn't force myself any further.  The book reads like one long run-on sentence.  Ideas that should have taken a few words to mention are given several paragraphs; those that should have taken a paragraph are given many pages.  An example from early on:  the author spends an inordinate time speaking of how Melkor's tainting of the Music of the Ainur and his eventual exile compares to the Eden story in the Judeo-Christian belief system.  The author states explicitly that she assumes familiarity with the Silmarillion; anyone with such familiarity who was raised by or near Judeo-Christian folk, who also has this presumed knowledge of the Silmarillion, will find this to be obvious and nearly trivial. Instead of being a building block for a larger theme, is in itself given several pages of aimless discussion!  Furthermore, if (besides Silmarillion familiarity) the reader has anything more than a thin overview of knowledge of Greek and Norse myths, then nothing of interest can be learned here.  My guess is that, like me, you'll find that you can rewrite all the useful information contained in the first 75 pages as a single paragraph, not taking even a single page, and conveying the same informational content.  I wouldn't bother 
 I have read and heard so many negative things about Oxycontin that I can't keep silent about this any longer! I am a chronic pain patient who was on Oxycontin for many years. I also participated in one of their early drug trials for chronic pain, so I have personally contributed input to Purdue about how this medicine affected my body and mind. It was truly a lifesaver for me at the time, as it allowed me to return to work on a full-time basis. (When I say full-time, I REALLY mean FULL-TIME! I had two full-time 40 hr./week jobs plus I designed a bi-monthly magazine on a free-lance basis. I have several inoperable conditions which cause me to suffer constant, intractable pain on a daily basis.   I tried all natural alternatives such as chiropractic, acupuncture, massage, meditation, herbal diets and others for several years before finally applying to Purdue's clinical trial for chronic back pain, in which Oxycontin was being used for pain relief. By the time I started the trial I could hardly sit in my office chair for more than 15 minutes. I had tried other medications new to the market at the time including Trazadone, which put my heart into severe arrhythmia for days after taking only one dose. Other drugs had intolerable side effects; Oxycontin did not. Instead, I received a steady dosage of pain relief medication which did not make me 'high', sleepy nor nauseated. I was overjoyed to have my quality of life returned to me!   After being in the 3-year clinical trial for a year and a half, I was told that the trial was being suddenly halted due to the bad press that Oxycontin was receiving. The company which handled the clinical trial for Purdue did not want to be involved so they just dropped all participants, leaving us with only a few pills on hand and no referral to a pain management doctor, as they had initially promised. I was fortunate to find a doctor at the 11th hour who would accept me as a pain patient.   Without getting into all the details of 'life afterwards', it should suffice for me to mention that Oxycontin can be a worthwhile and helpful drug in the hands of a chronic pain patient. A person in pain does NOT get 'high' from opiates. Instead, the medicine is used up by the pain receptors in the brain and never reaches the 'pleasure centers'. Pain patients feel ONLY RELIEF FROM PAIN.   I sincerely wish this bad press would stop as it is doing a great injustice to the chronic pain patient. If a person wants to get 'high', they can take Oxycontin or they can take a slew of other drugs OR they can simply turn to alcohol, which is not only legal but is also widely available! I can guarantee that more young people are killed by the effects of alcohol than by Oxycontin. And yes, they can still sniff glue or smoke pot or take any number of synthetic substances such as Ecstasy and get their buzz that way. Oxycontin and Purdue are not the villains here; instead, we need to look to ourselves for responsibility and sometimes to the parents for their lack of responsibility. And ultimately, the person taking the drug is the one who has the REAL responsibility -- not only to themselves, but to everyone around them who might be affected one day by their bad decisions.   Let's put the blame where it belongs and STOP punishing the chronic pain patients, who are only trying to have some quality of life. Thank you for listening - now won't you please help us by spreading the word that we deserve to have our dignity restored and the quality of life returned to us - even if that means we have to take Oxycontin in order to be able to live?  Thank you.......K 
 This once promising and enjoyable series (and I have read every book) has just become too much like an overblown TV soap opera. Every time one problem or mystery seems to be cleared up, it either evolves into something else or another situation takes it's place and we have to wait a year or more for the next episode. Temple appears to have finally made a choice between the two M's but we all know that's only a deception. The one bright spot in the story (and earlier books had a whole lot more of them) is on page 297 and involves the wonderful Fontana Brothers doing a James Bond imitation. It took me forever to read this book and made me think it would be my last Midnight Louie story until the end. And I must say it's a shocker and I will have to read the next installment but get a headache thinking things will drag out til the author reaches "Z" 
 I just finished reading Ida Lupino and was so disappointed.  The author is not a biographer - he's a second-rate journalist at best.  He managed to cull together a great many facts and just tossed them around, hoping for a narrative.  There are so many things I'd like to know that just weren't answered.  An example - Ida had one child, Brigett.  She's mentioned a few times, then qualified as the center of Ida's life and the main reason for her giving up her directing career - to stay home and raise her.  Yet we learn absolutely nothing about this daughter.  No personal description, no personality profile, no private life or professional info.  All that is said is that when she grew up, she moved out of the house and moved "far away from Los Angeles."  These facts would have been easy to find, but the lazy author just glossed over whatever he didn't have. The style is high school level - things repeated over and over and restated in sentence after sentence and rephrased a paragraph later.  Terribly amateurish.  Didn't he even have the benefit of an editor?  Lastly, the author has fallen in love with his subject and lost all perspective on both her flaws and her achievements and lasting importance.  There's no solid analysis of her acting technique - just carefully chosen trade reviews that are most favorable to her.  Ida Lupino mastered basically one type of performance, and she gave it over and over again.  For a particular type of role, she could be extremely effective by displaying her tense, neurotic personality.  But she certainly wasn't any great actress, not by anybody's standards, except the author's, and definitely only a competent director, not the female William Wyler the author tries to paint her as being.  Lupino deserves a far more thorough and honest bio than this 
 The author presented quite a rosy picture on China. On privatization, this book praised the successful gradual approach of the government. On institutional reform and liberalization, the market forces and foreign investors seem to be transforming China into a "rational" and democratic system.  Although the author distances himself from the neoliberals on the issue about privatization, his logic on institutional transition and modernization nevertheless make him more of a neoliberal than otherwise. This book described the policy reforms and changes of social control mechanism nicely, but not the social problems and challenges resulted from the reform.  Optimism is fine, but downplaying the uncertainties and social ills associated with globalization is not. The excessive optimism of the book make it like an English version of a Chinese official textbook 
 There's a lot of stuff here. But it's very difficult to navigate and not very well organized. One of my co workers loaned me a book called PC Hardware Maintenance and Repair by Michael Graves and I find myself going to it instead. Still, Scott really does know his stuff 
 This is an unbelievably bad book. "Unbelievable" is the correct word. Lunn has trouble with sentences and paragraphs with a single subject are quite beyond him. Logical flow of thought does not occur either. Worse, as a "historian," he accepts as facts, concepts which are in great dispute or have no documentary evidence (too many to mention, but start with Mary Magdalene in France and even the existence of Arthur in England). Try another source for decoding 
 Dance of Death, Iron Maiden's 2003 studio release ended up being a personal favorite of mine.  I still enjoy great songs such as the title track, "Rainmaker" and "Paschendale."  All three of these songs, in fact, are on Death on the Road.  You'd think I'd be happy, but, I'm afraid, I am not.  In 2001, Iron Maiden released a live album entitled Rock in Rio.  Long story short: Buy it.  Don't buy this.  They are basically the same thing, except Rock in Rio lacks songs from Dance of Death, and the mediocre (and that's being nice) performance that accompanies them on Death on the Road.  What happened?  I was so anxious for this album I imported it from Japan to avoid waiting for the delayed USA release.  When I first popped this in my CD player, I thought I was experiencing a hearing malfunction, but, unfortunately for Iron Maiden - I wasn't.  What I was experiencing, however, was a band going through the motions.  Track by track you will find a vocalist struggling to reach the notes he achieves in the studio, you will find Janick unable to replicate his solos, you will find tempos slowed or tempos rushed to the point of annoyance.   You will find one of the most ho-hum live performances from one of metal's greatest bands.  You will find yourself - fist clenched - screaming to the heavens "Why God?  WHY!?"  A live album is supposed to make you either remember, or wish you were at the concert.  It's also helpful if the performance is at least close, or equal to the one a band delivers in studio.  Live albums have long been hit or miss for Iron Maiden (hit: Live After Death, miss: A Real Live/Dead One) - and this, I'm afraid, is a miss.  The only thing you'll "miss" by avoiding this release is Bruce gasping for air on most of the songs.  You might also miss the one millionth performance of "Run to the Hills" - could you live with that on your conscience?    I hope you can, because your wallet will thank you.  Need a Maiden live fix?  Get Rock in Rio.  Absolutely need to have every Maiden release?  Pick this up used, it's the least you could do.  Let's hope when Iron Maiden invariably releases a live album after this fall's studio release and subsequent tour they put a little effort into delivering a memorable performance worthy of releas 
 I love to read and listen to books on CD but I have tried to listen to this a couple of times and I am disgusted.  The language and the sexually inferences are so vile and gratuitous that I can't get past the second disc.  Very disappointed 
 I found the writing of this book quite bad. While reading the book I felt like suggesting that the author find a good editor to clean up the uneven, choppy, and repetitious writing here. She uses the word "nowadays" all too often, I even found it in a passage which is attributed to a person who wrote into her column in The Atlantic Monthly. I could get out one of my old writing books and give specific examples of the areas that are in need of a tune up, but I do not wish to put that much time into this review, nor do I think that this is what this forum is meant for. And I do not relish giving a bad review, the author seems to be well intentioned and probably a good and productive person, but this is more the reason I felt the need to add my two cents.  I came here to Amazon's review forum to find out if anyone else felt the same way I did, and was amazed that so many well educated readers found the book so good. This is quite disturbing. I now doubt that well educated readers are able to discern between good and bad writing. It also makes me wonder if the reviews are from friends, many of them sounded so similar. The ideas are refreshing, but presentation could use one or two more rounds with a good, or perhaps different, editor 
 Joseph Arthur's latest effort substantially lacks the sublime ambience of his previous endeavors.  One can listen to "In Ohio" over and over and over while continuously marveling at its beauty.  It's terribly unfortunate that no other song on this album emanates a similar raw, aesthetic element which is immediately apparent on Arthur's past travels 
 While this book is generally on with its observations of general human behavior, it should in the relationship section, not psychology. Its pop-psych style of unsubstantiated examples doesn't provide much valuable  information for you to learn from. It's an entertaining read, but when all  is said and done, it's difficult for a reader with any knowledge of the  MBTI to feel like they've learned anything worthwhile. If you want a book  about relationship quirks, this is the one. Otherwise, look for something  else 
 This book is beyond mildy boring. It's easy to spot the 'plot twists' several chapters before they occur. All her jokes center around one-theme that isn't funny from the start. I recommend it only if you're looking for a cheap read that doesn't require any thinking. I was very disappointed 
 This book is beyond weak.  I would like to give it negative stars if possible.  The characters are confusing and little goes on with them that is worth reading about or believable.  I suppose if you like fictional sex and rambling writing you will love this book.  Personally, I want a refund 
 following in the footsteps of oceans eleven, in one word... horrible.  the plot was really weak, and the ending was completly unexpected, in this case, that was not good.  there was nothing wrong with the actors, they were all good, it is just the plot was horrible. 
 I loved this when it came out, but I also loved lots of things then that weren't good for me. Not that this is harmful in any way... it's just that it is really, really awful.  Lemmy is the only one in the band that could play with any facility or sense of melody, and even he wasn't exactly at his best then. The drummer is an unsteady, two-lick metronome, and Dave Brock continuously uses a wah pedal on his guitar solos to try to cover up for the fact that he sounds like he's playing with his toes. Overlay it all with undifferentiated sonic sludge, add a flute/reed player who seems to have never learned half the notes on either instrument, and sprinkle with "cosmic" lyrics that weren't so much goofy as stupid - that was Hawkwind.   Don't buy the hype. Hawkwind was always terrible, if terribly sincere. They were a joke then, and if you pay what they're asking for this idiocy, the joke's on you. Want space rock? Buy Gong, or even Planet Gong, not this mud 
 I read the promising reviews and found the story's premise interesting, but what a let down. I eagerly read the first few chapters and then discovered that the author really didn't have much more to say. Oh, he kept building his characters into what should have become some sort of crescendo, but sadly there was none, and the plot simply fizzled out and died. On the last twenty pages or so, I found myself skipping over whole paragraphs in a vain search for something interesting to happen. I couldn't wait for the main character to die so I could finally understand the ultimate reality the author, no doubt, was going to reveal in the end. It seems the author simply got tired of rambling on about the characters and decided to hastily bail out 
 My daughter brought this book home from the school library and started to read it aloud. I was appalled at the first sentence. "Jim's dog got killed by the garbage truck". Of course, that immediately caught my attention. I wasn't sure she was making up the sentence! I thought WOW. I didn't think it was at all appropriate for a first grader in general. This book should be used for a very specific purpose. Perhaps maybe if the first grader was in a situation where their pet died but not for leisure reading at all. The book's characters display isolation and aggression; verbal and physical. I considered the entire content of the book very inappropriate 
 Maybe I made a mistake starting with a book that's 3rd in a series without reading the earlier ones first. I gave it up at page 118 as I just couldn't get engaged by the characters.  My previous experience with the Anita Blake series led me to this book hoping for a gutsy heroine and lots of action. There is action and descriptions of odd characters with extra eyes and magic skills. Guess I didn't make it to the sexy parts, as they mostly were talking about it, trying to be lyrical, but somehow the characters weren't coming alive for me so I gave it up.  I didn't want to pan this book entirely, knowing Laurell Hamilton's abilities, she might pull it together, but I just wasn't willing to keep soldiering on hoping for a turn around. 
 I was under the impression that this book would help me get unstuck from my current career. This book is primarily for teams, and even that  it is very weak in creating a formula to help solving complex problems. The suggestions that it does give are so basic and simple that the author was either wanting just to sell a book of random "nice" thoughts, or has not been in the private sector to realize the complexities of doing business. The last comment in the book is what pushed me over the edge, it recommended buying a copy of this for everyone that I know in the business world to help them. The only money I would waste is buying a copy for the authors, they obviously haven't listened to their own advice 
 Humorous but crude. Well written but sexually explicit. Be aware that the lust-obssessed characters and some graphically described sex scenes detract from an otherwise entertaining plot 
 Shevonne the imperial hoodrat or whatever you claim to be.....you wouldn't know about being a hustler if Ice-T slapped you with your tampon. Its painfully obvious that you don't have any music knowledge due to the fact you enjoy ignorant, inbred, klown music. I am sure you do relate to the lyrics because you definitely have the iq of a tree frog. And no I will never reach that level.......or should I say sink to that level because I never move backwards with my intellect only forward.   Dem Wack boyz are one of th worst groups out there to date.  Support real emcees like Mos Def, KRS-One, and Immortal Technique 
 I loved Waterhouse's book "Outsmarting the Female Fat Cell" and I was hoping to learn a lot from this one too.  Unfortunately, this book was offering 8 commonly known strategies, like: destress your life - that's good - without more specific HOW's.  An example; if you have three kids, a demanding job and an unhelpful husband, she'd like you to change your attitude, not particularly your life.  Hello!  I've learned all of her strategies and a lot more from magazines, such as Prevention, including more up-to-date facts.  For instance, Waterhouse recommends kava-kava for sleeping.  However, lately kava-kava has come into disrepute due to German medical studies.  Also, I would have rather seen more information explaining WHY these 8 stragies work, rather than just the "do-it's", for instance: how hormones affect us, etc... as her other book did 
 i ALWAYS give rave reviews to books, but not this one.  i am a happily married romantic at heart, and this is the only book i have never in my life been able to finish.  (i average 35 books a year).  it was just bland and boring and oh so.......boring.  do not recommend, though, i would have liked to with such a romantic title : 
 this is an excellent novel, well written and not only a good story but a fascinating glimpse into a world that no longer exists. Interspersed with wonderful insights into the systematic and awful oppression of young girls are glimpses into the everyday life of a culture within a culture, food, customs, clothes, songs and so on but within a world vulnerable to the surrounding and increasingly hostile, racist, ignorant anti semitism of the Iranian islamic community. i will read it agin soon 
 This book is great for freshmen or anyone who had never exposed to economics. It's simplicity and clarity makes learning economics fun, yet it doesn't sacrifice any indepth necessary 
 The chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch, however, it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate.   The 1 star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack.  I had intended to use it as a cold mask only.   
 Please, please.........  Do not buy this thing, there is a wealth of information by users out there with multiple problems and almost non-existent support.  If you do buy one - DO NOT MIRROR IT! - use it only as a storage device without any of the RAID features, otherwise you will almost certainly lose your data!  I ultimately stopped using mine and went to a USB/Firewire attached external drive enclosure, much faster a more versatile.  Good luck 
 In her section about Lakewood, the author tries to create a connection between Lakewood, the spur posse, and the military-industrial complex that does not exist.  She regards Lakewood as a breeder town, built to supply human labor for the aerospace industry.  Here are the facts:  1.  Lakewood was created in 1948 by real estate investors to provide housing for returning WW2 veterans.  2.  The LB Naval Shipyard, Douglas Aircraft, Lockheed, Northrop, and North American Aviation were all in operation long before Lakewood was built.  3.  The spur posse was given way too much publicity by the tabloid TV vultures to a National audience.  I emphasize the word National.  The market for those kind of unhealty tv shows goes beyond southern Calif.  Lakewood home values are very good, and the neighborhood infrasturcture is a lot more organized than most southern Calif housing projects built in the same era.  If she wants to bash a southern Calif. neighborhood, Long Beach would be an easier target.  There, you have many nice one-home lots that were destroyed by investors who built 8-unit apartments on a one-home lot.  Anyone who has not actually lived in Lakewood might believe her essay...but it is not reality.  In the end, she thinks So. Calif is headed over the cliff.  I would say the idyllic "Calif. Golden Fantasy" is no more...but whatever changes that occur here will have to be dealt with in a positive manner, instead of just being given an obituary 
 I started reading this to my 6 and 8 year old, and got about 5 chapters into it before I started to doubt my choice of reading material for these kids. For one thing, the language is archaic and hard to wrap your mouth around. But for another, the values expressed in this 300 year old book are a bit disturbing. The God-fearing family runs aground on an idyllic island full of naturally growing fruits and vegetables, and arrives with supplies aplenty to draw from, but within a week they have slaughtered at least a dozen creatures. Seems to me the main theme of the book is "man's dominance over nature." Doesn't work for me 
 If you are looking for a book to learn a few parlor tricks about palm reading, there are other books out there that are better.  This book is literally a miniature book, being only about 4 nches long and does not  offer any substantive info on palm reading..  I don't recommend it 
 Once again, Ladinsky claims to be presenting English speaking readers with the work of the great Persian poet Hafiz, and once again, he hasn't felt the need to actually learn Persian or actually base these works on any previous translation of any poem by Hafiz. These are the poems that Ladinsky imagines Hafiz might have written had he been a twentieth century baby boomer Californian disciple of Meher Baba, instead of a 14th century Persian Sufi Muslim. Ladinsky believes (or claims to believe) that Hafiz told him these poems. If so, the afterlife hasn't done anything for the great poet's literary talent 
 See the swastika on the cover?  I bought the book and then returned it.  Don't waste your time.  You'll find more secrets in your local newspaer than here. Sorry  guys, this book is just not woth the paper it is printed on 
 I was very disapointed with this book.  First it is a self published book that needs to be proof read and the font selected is horrid and hard to read.  Secondly, this is Stringfellow's soap box about her ex husband and work troubles.  It kept sounding like she was taking revenge on these people with her words, it just didn't set well with me.  The part that she did talk about Faith the dog, she really didn't go into any great detail.  Pass on this book and get Grim's book about Quentien, the dog who survived the gas chamber, its a much better read 
 I bought this sandbox for my 2 1/2 year old son, and he loves playing in the sand with it.  However, I am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the Naturally Playful sandbox (which I was originally going to purchase, but got this one instead to save $10 - mistake).  As soon as I put the lid on it caved in the middle (of course, I already had sand in it).  Also, the lid just seems to lay on the top, and could be easily blown off.  I'm sure it won't last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back 
 The compositions, Rhythms and singin-style of Peter Cetera sound always the same. He is a typical sappy love song - singer who prefers the love ballads and cheesy love adventures. it might have been a bit tedious and boring.  The problem is everywhere: If you are a Hardrock fan like bands Uriah Heep, Stevie Ray Vaughan, AC/DC, Rory Gallagher, Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, your ears can't be familar with all these silly love songs. My ears cannot work like that.  there are two alternatives: - if you are a hardrock fan. You like a mythological lyrics, you won't like Peter Cetera or Chicago. Keep your fingers away from this !!! - if you are a sappy love song fan then please buy this cd !! 
 This gets my vote as Miles' worst pre-electric recording date. It's one of the most desultory jazz recording sessions ever made. All the tunes are done slowly to highlight Miles' lyricism, but everything is so draggy that he just sounds bored. Elvin Jones, a great modern drummer, is totally handcuffed. Also, the CD is a major ripoff (even as it was on LP): we get only 27 minutes of music (which, come to think of it, might be a blessing in disguise: the less of this music the better). For die-hard Miles fans only (and then to only hear him at his worst) 
 My most recent purchase of this disc ellicited only "modified rapture". I found many songs to be irritating at first, with "Original Prankster" being the most offensive. I actually had to turn it off - I've NEVER done that with an Offspring song but once and that was during "Cool to Hate" (Ixnay), which I eventually warmed up to, and this one too, after another chance. Is it odd that "Dammit I changed again" has a similar reappearance in "Lightning Rod" (Splinter)? And listen to "One Fine Day" (my favourite on the disc) - tell me you don't immediately think of Green Day! OK, maybe only the introduction. One of the few highlights for me was "Special Delivery", but probably because I can relate to the words.  I liked Ixnay and Americana - this just seemed like leftovers. I loved Splinter. I think Conspiracy just didn't have the same consistent feel. It's not awful, but I just didn't like it. I'm slowly warming up to it 
 The highlights of this book: - factual errors - irrational layout - practice tests that don't remotely resemble the real thing. Don't buy it 
 Tiresome, repetitive sexual descriptions, no character development, unexplained events, no plot, very little humor.  Ten years ago, Hamilton was doing interesting work, exploring some moral issues, having some character development, and humor.  Now both the Blake and Gentry series are predicable and sex obsessed 
 I just did not like this book, it just did not have much of a point.  Even the usual witty repartee between Amelia and Emerson wasn't enough to salvage this book for me.  The whole plot seems pointless with Amelia and Emerson just meandering around Egypt's various famous archaeological sites.  As much as I hate to admit it, I really missed Ramses, and that whole England bit was far too boring.  Let's hope the next book redeems the series for me 
 It would take a book to answer all that is wrong with Farrell's reasoning, but to make a few points:  1. He implies that female 'circumcision' is much the same as male circumcision which is astounding but points to his general ignorance. If male circumcision is about teaching males to endure pain (actually more about male tribal bonding) then what on earth is a little girl being taught when she has her external genitalia cut away and is left with a tiny hole and a life-time of pain and health problems?? It's for protection? What, or whose, interests are being protected?   2. He does not acknowledge that the shorter male life-span is due to testosterone and all its consequences for males. Castration is known to increase the male life-span. Why do men even want more testosterone rather than less? Surely illogical?  3. The male 'instinct' to protect females is actually to protect the bodies men need for sex and reproduction. As more than 50 million females have been killed recently in Asia simply because they were female should make us question this supposed 'instinct to protect'. And protecting females most often translates into ownership and control. This is a similar logic to that of men in certain cultures that use the pretext of honor to justify the murder of females. Why do women need protection form their protectors? Men need to explain their logic here. Is it something like the protection criminal gangs provide for people against other criminal gangs?   4. Powerless men are created by male-male competition for access to young females and again, the sacred testosterone drives this not women.   5. His views on rape are ridiculous. Young human females have permanent sexual signals whether they want sex or not. These external signals do not usually reflect the females internal desires and concerns and this causes the confusion. Men are responding to fake signals that females don't know how to override without becoming invisible altogether.  6. This book is basically about all the hoops males try and jump through in order to rise in the male hierarchy and ultimately get their DNA into numbers of females.The men who fail are the men without power. Farrell wants us to feel sorry for them which is as likely as men feeling sorry for, and diverting their monogamous sexual interest and resources towards, unnattractive old women.   7.Farrell does not explain the irrationality of men rejecting and being abusive about women who don't sexually reject most men (ie the easy women) at the same time as they complain about the pain of being sexually rejected so often by women. There must be some mysterious male logic to it - perhaps situated in a fantasy world of being the only male who isn't rejected. Duplicity is clearly a male trait that farrell failed to mention.  8. It is a suspect logic that concludes that the people who have been the lawmakers and political leaders for millennia ie males, have actually only been acting in the self-interest of females. For men to have evolved a lack of self-interest is impossible. To argue that they have is Farrell's most ludicrous argument. Of course women also have self-interest, intimately tied to that of their children. The very real difference is that because we evolved with a mating system where females moved to male-bonded kin groups to breed males had the advantages of size, kin-bonding, no real reproductive demands of offspring and time and cicumstances that enabled them to be the rule-makers which included the enforcement of ownership and control of females as they were exchanged between groups for breeding. They may have felt varying amounts of power within that system and they may have felt the power of their sex needs as female power but to say that this is actually women having and exercising power is absurdly illogical and contrary to reality. It is another fantasy to add to that of South Sea Island free sex and mermaids.  This book is interesting for debate and as an example of male sexual frustration being blamed on women. Ultimately it is about how some men suffer trying to get sexual/reproductive access to females and might help us notice that the 'power' being defined is reproduction.  In a market where the supply of sperm far outstrips the tiny market of eggs it does reduce the value of sperm and create massive competition in males and competition in females for better quality sperm and/or extras that improve the outcome for offspring. Embedded in Farrell's books is the manipulative attempt to solve this by encouraging young women to 'put out' more. It's the same old male longing for 'free' sex ie the usual reproductive behavior of male animals where post-copulatory costs are carried by females.  In nature male animals experience far less or equal disposability as females when they are monogamous and concentrate more on parenting ie are symmetrical with female reproductive behavior. Can we look forward to this in the human male in the near future and solve the whole problem? Can we expect men might consider reducing the supply ie their sex-drive/seeking multiple partners and increasing their childcare. Reduce testosterone? Or is that blasphemy?  The new question is What do men want? The answer is the same as ever - sex. The methods of trying to get it are the same even when put in a new wrapper such as Farrell's ie irrationality, deceit and manipulation. Perhaps the real myth is the myth of ADULT power and we should direct our anger and frustration towards our gametes, hormones, fetuses, infants and children that are the real reason males and females exist, are pulled together and driven apart.  At least let's not create a new myth that the human male somehow managed to evolve a lack of self-interest. How gullible does Farrell hope we are 
 Yet another in the series about the late Sleeping Prophet of Virginia Beach. I thought this was a boring book. I also don't believe a word of it. Anyone who does subscribe to the notions of this book needs to take some elementary history and geology courses. It'd be one thing if it was presented as fiction but it's given as apparent fact. Over the years Cayce gave a lot of information in his life about the continent of Atlantis and its role in human (pre)history. The problem is, Cayce gave dates for when Atlantis was to rise from the ocean once again. 1975 and some other predicted times came and went and as far as I know, no Atlantis. Surely we couldn't miss a massive continent jutting up out of the Atlantic near Bermuda, could we? This should be one more nail in the coffin of Cayce's reputation (he also claimed moderate smoking was good for you, along with many false predictions and downright silly assertions) but for some reason the "sleeping prophet" seems as famous among need-to-believe types as ever. I've read a couple of his books, or I should say, books assembled out of his various "psychic" readings, and in every case I came away feeling ripped off and let down. Was Cayce for real? He did seem to enter a trance-like state, true, but the things he said from within those trances don't seem in hindsight to have been validated, so I question how much value should be placed on them. Hey, if reading about fantasies of lost continents makes you happy, then slap down your eight bucks for this book. An evening spent with a Cayce book isn't as bad for you as, say, moderate smoking. From my own non trance-like state, however, I, the Non-Sleeping Prophetess of Mason, Ohio, predict most people won't feel it's worth their time and money 
 This was a hot mess, it was so boring I couldn't even finish the book, I passed it on to my cusion, and she said the same thing, I just gave the book away. My hopes were all high from Flyy Gryl, but thats the only good book that Omar written. I was so upset by this that I actually wanted to write Omar Tyree myself and ask him what the hell was going on. I mean when you write a bad book chances are that no one is going to want to read the next book. I hate reading a bad book because I feel it is just a waist of my time, and I could've done somthing better. Omar, you owe my 4 hours of a good book 
 Overall it is a fairly good album.  Marques Houston has grown into a fine young man.  I am just as old as Marques Houston so I can remember his Immature days.  In my opinion, there are very few songs that are worth being listened to over and over and some that are not.  The tracks that I like are as follows:  1-All because of You 2-Sex Wit You 3-Marriage 5-Naked 6-Do You Mind 11-Everything  
 As a product of a non-religious household who only converted to Christianity earlier this year at age 24, I might have been the ideal reader of this book.  Regrettably, it didn't speak to me at all.  Without any doubt, many of those coming of age today sense deep, underlying problems with the state of society.  Many are responding by turning to the teachings of Jesus Christ that until recently guided all of western civilization.  There must be a good book to be written about us, but this isn't it.  Carroll's hypothesis is simple: today's young adult Christians reject both secular thinking and watered-down versions of Christianity (as typified by Vatican II) in favor of orthodox Christian belief and practice.  She presents some statistics, but her main body of evidence is interviews.  She mentions dozens of young adult Christians as well as priests and community leaders, but she doesn't quote them at length.  Each one gets a page or less, barely enough to recite a few cliches.  For instance on page 118:  "In a suburb on the western edge of St. Louis, a cohort of young Catholics gathers each month for eucharistic adoration, confession, and charismatic praise-and-worship sessions.  The group, known as the House of Prayer, is run by a handful of young adults brimming with enthusiasm for Catholicism and the desire to convert their peers.  Attendance at meetings sometimes hovers around a hundred, and postmeeting conversations routinely include news of the latest conversions to Catholicism or vocation to the priesthood.  Participants in the group also lead door-to-door evangelization blitzes and youth ministry events intended to invigorate the faith of Catholic teenagers."  Period.  End of sentence, end of paragraph, end of section; House of Prayer is never mentioned again.  This abrupt style shortchanges the subjects.  Nobody in the book really gets a chance to share their stories.  A real conversion experience takes more than a page to explain (I would know) and this book really gives only rough outlines of what happened to each person and organization, sometimes not even that.  Hence it's hard to form an emotional attachment to anyone you read about.  Furthermore, Carroll can't stop her own opinions from bleeding over into the text.  For instance, she cites several people complaining that their childhood churches were too dedicated to service, and not enough to ritual.  Her attachment to ritual--particularly the Catholic mass--is clear, but she doesn't acknowledge alternatives.  Some people may feel at home in a ritualistic, prayerful life, and more power to them.  But if others feel that God calls them to a life of service, then that's what will suit them better.  The chapters on politics on academics are even more one-sided.  For instance, we hear about City College and the annual Society for Law, Life and Religion symposium, which, Carroll notes approvingly, "featured conservative columnist Ann Coulter."  (If she cares that Coulter opposes all three things in the title, Carroll doesn't mention it here.)  The big problem is the ceasless attempts to play the victim.  Almost every paragraph villianizes the big bad postmodernists, secularists, relativists, etc... etc...  It's taken as a given that these people completely control our society and dominate everything that everyone sees and hears.  Personally I don't recall ever seeing Jacques Derrida deconstructing Rousseau when I turn on my TV.  The evidence is thin for the "tyranny of relativism"; in fact it consists of only one student saying that in class he'd "get funny looks if he mentioned Jesus." (Horrors!)  But besides insulting the reader's intelligence, this insistence on perennial victimhood masks a bigger problem.  Carroll keeps insisting that young orthodox Christians are counterculture, but you can't be counterculture when there's no culture left to counter.  It's useless to insist that we have to undermine existing beliefs.  As Chesterton said, "You can't undermine a hole in the ground.  If you try, you will only make the hole bigger."  It's time for Christian writers to give up the endless victimhood and realize that if we want our religion to last we need to start building up out of the rubble rather than just claiming our own patch of it 
 Just plain common sense. There wasn't profound thought through out the whole book.  I finished in thirty minutes 
 I kept falling asleep reading this book.  He keeps repeating the same thing paragraph after paragraph.  I found His Needs Her Needs to be a much better book 
 This proves the cynics who say that Groucho was always the funny one to be correct. Not only did I fail to laugh once at his dismal attempt at humour, I also failed to understand what most of the words meant. Avoid 
 This manual contains valid and useful information but is very poorly laid out.  The table of contents and the index contain not one single page listing, Duh!  Additionally all the figures are at the end of the chapter, hand drawn, hand written figure numbers or just plan missing.  But the kicker is this and most of the sniper/target interdiction books are available in pdf format for free.  Contact me at my email address.  This is so typcial of the publishers Paladin Press, Delta Press, etc 
 I loved Anne Bishop's Black Jewels Trilogy so much. But it took me a long time to pick up this book, because it just didn't sound terribly appealing.  And it wasn't appealing in the least. The one character I did like was portrayed as a cold, possessive jerk by the end of the book. The mysterious Lucien is shunted aside for the "sweet" Neall who has about as much depth as a puddle. And Ari, as a heroine, is a joke. There was nothing to like about her at all.  The Fae storyline was tragically typical. They're arrogant and uncaring, so now their world is disappearing. Can't we have some Fae that aren't high and mighty? The only thing truly interesting about them was their positions which coincided with gods of ancient Greek and Roman myth, and their ability to turn into an animal representative of that.  Anne Bishop is a great writer, but you couldn't tell by reading this book. It had none of the dark, edgy feeling of her first novels and feels like a cop out, as well as a whack over the head with strong feminist beliefs and the Wiccan religion 
 worked for a month on and off and now doesent work at all. 
 There is only ONE page of useful info in the entire book. I am not kidding! ONE page. Everything else is fluff to sell a book. I thought it might be fun to read in bed w/ my girlfriend...negative.  the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w/ some arrows that say "rub here."  Everything else was crap.  And a waste of time. I guess if you are a terrible lover who doesn't try and please your woman - it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there. If you know it's important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page. Look it up on the net and save your money 
 I was a fan of Robert's since his days at Ohio State.  I admired him for his stance he took then by skipping football for a year.  Although, I missed watching him on the field, I respected him more for doing that.  I also respect him for the work he does today with kids.  However, I found the book to be mediocre.  He has some interesting opinions (most I don't agree with), but he usually doesn't go into enough detail when supporting them.  He talks about football for 85% of the book, then crams all kind of issues in the final 15%.  He probably would be better off either writing a longer book or another book altogether.    I am curious as to why most every review touches on his intelligence.  I found that to be irrelevant.  Some people attacked him because of some grammatical issues early on in the book.  While I noticed these, I thought it was more important on what he was trying to say.  If you are that put off on these minute details, I have some of the most boring books on the planet I can send you that are grammatically correct and you can spend the next 5 years reading them.  I really don't think Robert cares if you believe him to be intelligent or not.  I know I wouldn't.    Overall, I thought there were some interesting stories and I appreciated his honesty.  However, I found the book to average at best and it's overall layout didn't seem to make much sense. 
 The first thing you should know is that this book is not really intended to teach you the GOF patterns -- read the GOF book for that. That said, it does do a decent job of translating the GOF patterns into C#.  My main gripe, and it is a big one, is that this book is *very* difficult to read because half of the relevant material is in the form of "challenges" whose answers are in an appendix at the back of the book. Please note that these "challenges" are not supplemental exercises that can be skipped -- they contain key information that is needed to understand the implementation of the pattern. Having to jump back and forth on nearly every page make the book almost unusable 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 I am a well trained, working actor.  Books that have truly helped me get to where I am are K Callan's "The New York Agent Book" and Brian O'neil's "Acting as a Business".  Far more specific and useful.  This book is general, and offers no new information 
 Simple is definitely the word to describe this book. The photography is gorgeous and the pictures take up most of the space.But the projects are contrived and poorly explained for beginners. A mix of retro hippie/today's young hip designs. There isn't one project that interests me nor is there any inspiration to be taken from these designs. I expect better books from Interweave Press. This one is a disappointment. I gave the same review for Color on Color by the same author 
 +++++  This book (first published in 1934) contains brief writings of physicist Albert Einstein (1879 to 1955), one of the most creative intellects of the twentieth century.  It contains articles (speeches, letters, statements, etc.) from early in his career.    This book gives a personal portrait of the man behind the scientific legend.   The book itself is divided into four parts:   (1) The world as I see it (about 30 articles).  This is my favorite part.  (2) Politics and pacifism (almost 20 articles).  Einstein was a pacifist (one who opposes the use of force under any circumstances).  (3) Germany (3 articles).  Einstein was born in Ulm, Wurttemberg, Germany.  (He later emigrated to the United States in late 1932.)  (4) The Jews (just over 10 articles).  Einstein was Jewish.  Finally, if this book is so good, then why did I give it the rating I did?  Two reasons.  First, there is a much more comprehensive book that also has gathered Einstein's writings.  It is called "Ideas and Opinions" (first published in 1954 and sold by Amazon).  It contains almost all the articles (it excludes seven) contained in "The World as I See It."   As well, it contains selected articles from other publications (most notably the books "Out of my Later Years" and "Mein Weltbild.")  As well, the book "Ideas and Opinions" has a fifth part called `Contributions to Science' (which contains almost 20 articles).  Here, Einstein discusses topics such as relativity, theoretical physics, science, and gravitation.  He even gives tributes to such people as Isaac Newton and Copernicus.  Second, this book's price.  It costs $9.20 and you get 65 articles.  But the hardcopy version of "Ideas and Opinions" costs about $6.00 and you get 120 articles (almost double the amount)!!  (Note that all prices quoted are as of May 2006.)   In conclusion, instead of this book, I recommend the more comprehensive and cheaper book called "Ideas and Opinions."  In my opinion, this recommended book is the definitive collection if Albert Einstein's popular writings!!!  +++++ 
 All the TV shows he mentioned were from around 1990, so I didn't have a clue what's he's talking about. If you wanna read a good nature book, then read Walden by Thoreau 
 I would not buy Sango products from Amazon if I were you.  Their supplier is terrible.  There is nothing wrong with Sango products, it is just that Amazon and the supplier do not care about product quality or customer happiness.  The first set that I received had bubbles in the glaze and it was easy to send it back.  However, the second set I received came broken.  Things like this do happen in the mail, but what upset me was the fact that there were wrapped up pieces and notes from a previous customer.  What this told me was that the supplier was sending out already returned broken items and trying to pass them off as new.  I brought this to Amazon's attention twice and all I received was a generic response.  I recommend you buy your Sango products elsewhere 
 now mabye this is not fair because i do not usually like realistic books but this book was boring. I hade to read this book for school and I was bored. It's about a young boy named Fu growing up and having a hard life in  China. I would not recomend this book unless really like realistic books  and ones that are slow. Did I mention the chapters were long 
 I`m trying to remember what made me pick up this book. I know I wanted some light reading for the summer days sitting on the beach but the Face was so bad it took me a month to finish it. I literally had to force myself to read it. The writing is vintage Koontz to the extreme. Koontz likes to describe things that not many people really care about and this book is yet another example. I call it diarrhea.(Spell check)  I respect Koontz, for example, Odd Thomas is really good but the face is a story of a boy who is the target of a sick, demented killer. Thanks to some spirit who led a disgraceful life while alive, the boy lives in the end.   A good 200 pages could have been deleted from this book and maybe then we would have had something decent. My advice is skip this one.   I would love to know if Mr. Koontz is being paid by the page? The face makes me wonder.. 
 This novel was a big disappointment to me.  It began with great promise but then fell apart at its midpoint.  I can only conclude that Ms. Aikens was writing under a deadline because the resolution of the various plot lines in the novel's concluding scene is ludicrous and unsatisfactory.  So save your money for another book 
 ....and it was true love. Shudder. I really expected the best from this book. The premise was so great, but the execution was so terribly awful. Mona, the main character was poorly fleshed out, and, while I truly felt sad for the tragedy in her past, I found that she was so consistently disengaged from her own life, that I could not empathize like I wanted to. I had hoped that with the word "reinventing" in the title, I would see some sort of cathartic metamorphosis in her character, but she seemed to stay the same. I thought that at the very least, I would get detailed accounts of her physical makeover, fashion choices, and lifestyle changes, but felt that there were many missed opportunities to add color to the story. I hated the F-bombs dropped so frequently by more than just the main character. Come on, puhleease, write me a real dialogue! Put some effort into it! A steady stream of obscenities is just a signal to me that I, the reader, was not worth the effort.  As for the Mike, the male lead, so to speak, he simply came across as a misogynist of the highest degree. Having Mona keep saying that "there was more to him than that" did not make it apparent to my mind. I could not see what either saw in each other. She came across as seriously whacked and manipulative, and he was absolutely the worst the male world could possibly offer, an insult to men everywhere. Stereotypes and cliches abounded. It was a wasted opportunity for the author, and a waste of my time. Sorry. 
 ...going to make money on nanotechnology within the next fifty years are stockbrokers and people like Jack Uldrich who -- for a fee of course -- will unveil their nanotechnology "expertise" and proffer advice accordingly...unfortunately, at this point, nanotechnology is little more than a fancy term -- practically speaking there is no tangible nanotechnology outside of research labs and what does exist is years away from commercial development...more pertinent in this particular case, Mr. Uldrich really provides no evidence to support his claim for "expertise" in the field of nanotechnolgy -- his resume shows only that he was a former naval intelligence officer and Defense Department official and also served as the Director of the Minnesota Office of Strategic and Long Range Planning under Governor Jesse Ventura...Jesse Ventura?...hmmmm, I'm not quite clear on how one acquires nanotechnology experience working for Jesse Ventura...moreover, his advice is basically free via columns he publishes every week on the "Motley Fool" website...no, I have to say this book is not recommended 
 This book deserves no stars.   PLEASE stop buying and promoting this rotten book! This is a book about a rotten, selfish self-centered male who takes everything including the life of the female tree. Even at the end when he chops her down to sit on her as an old man, he's still unsatisifed and has a big scowl on his face!  The female tree gives and gives and gives, and the male (from boy to old man) just takes and takes and takes and is never satisified, happy or thankful.  What kind of story is that?  This is truly a rotten story. Don't buy it! Don't give this to your children! 
 THE STORY OF O attempts to defy the wisdom of the 10 Commandments of Hot Movies and fails.  I won't bore you with all of the Commandments, just #7 "Thou shalt not make a hot movie with an entire cast of non-hot actors."  Shot in that hazy sometimes dreamy kind of way that I dislike TSOO is about a rich guy who sends his girlfriend to a mansion where unattractive masters train unattractive slaves how to be obedient.  After graduation the rich guy loses his woman to his older, much older, step-brother.  Other stuff happens (banging, branding, eating, talking, talking, talking, whipping), but it's all unimportant and not hot 
 I am a fan of Michael Crichton's.  Having said that, I felt that the writing style of this particular book was incredibly choppy, and that certain characters were not well developed at all (e.g. the wife!)    The basic premise was very interesting and the book was suspenseful; it moved along at a fast pace.  However, Crichton added too many characters, and made the book too dense.  I had to skim the last several chapters because I wanted to know what happened at the end, but I was getting extremely bored.  Obviously, he has come a long way since this book :-) Sigrid 
 Unlike the rest of the Rich Dad books that I've read -- which were for the most part fantastic -- this book was terrible.  Michael Lechter may indeed be a very bright guy and a star in his field, but he is an absolutely horrendous writer.  The intro by Robert Kiyosaki was the only really enjoyable part to the book.  Lechter immediately jumped into complex explanations of the various types of IP protection available without really clarifying anything for the lay person like me.  And no real life examples of anything -- just references to a couple hypothetical "horror stories" that he relays at the beginning of the book.  The only reason I gave this book 2 stars and not 1 is because at the very least I was able to get some basic definitions of IP terms down.  But I guess I could've gotten that from a dictionary too 
 . . . . . is that it's actually being discussed. I'm pretty down about the fact that I have so few ways in which to usefully spend my time that I am offering an opinion on this excrement. Exploitation of aging film stars is nothing new and if they are willing to be exploited then who am I to complain?; there's nothing objectionable about seeing a naked body on the screen, in my opinion; we all do stupid and regrettable things in our youth and they are, potentially, funny. However, certain crimes against the viewing public are inexcusable, namely the fact that WE HAVE SEEN IT ALL BEFORE, SO MANY TIMES. I, personally, feel insulted that we are being offered this crud but am also aware of a sense of doom that people are actually getting laughs from the tired, old, flogged cliches (you know, sock over turgid member, lustful older woman, kooky student, BOY WHO REALISES THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS etc., etc., etc). As a final tirade and the most astounding feature of all the reviews that have appeared before is that some so beguiled by their own "insights" that they are reviewing this film in a pseudo-academic manner. I was sure the word "ouvre" (if that's how it's spelt) would appear somewhere. Please, someone, tell me that nobody has yet written a PhD thesis on campus comedy, that most banal of film types. Please!!! Otherwise, truthfully, any pretension that we are an intelligent race may as well be buried once and for all.  Yes, this is a truly terrible film in every sense of the word. It is a "comedy" that is genuinely depressing but we're getting pretty used to being fed swill now, am I right? And some are becoming quite fond of the taste . .  
 yeah....this cd bit.  i bought chillout sessions 4 last year, and looked forward to buying this compilation as well.  unfortunately, it didn't live up to the last one.  out of the 20 or so tracks on the first cd, i liked 2-3...and they were all on other compilations i already own.  the same was true for the second cd.  this was not worth the money.  i was very disappointed 
 If you could really get into a good college by this kind of hype and  manipulation, I guess the Ivy League would have a real overcrowding problem.  Look instead at "Harvard Schmarvard" and "Getting in Without Freaking Out." Both are down-to-earth and incrediby helpful guides. 
 This book was okay... I too would say borrow it or check it out from the library.  It had some useful information, but what it did have was not indepth enough to really be of help, and most of it was irrelevant 
 Tells you what you should be doing but doesn't tell you how to do it. He explains what the quadrants are and goes in WAY too much detail describing the different types of people in these quadrants and does not tell you how to get from the employee quadrant to the investor quadrant. Makes suggestions like start a business or develop a business system. No mention on how to do that.   I just finished reading his Yahoo Finance article "A Taste for Debt" from 10/31/06 about upcoming tough financial times and he ends the article in typical Kioysaki (no explanation or in depth advice) fashion by saying "So what do I recommend? For now, enjoy the party, don't drink too much, and stay close to the exits".  Thanks for that Robert. I can't wait to not recommend and never buy one of your books again 
 I ordered this from Amazon and received it in about 2 days.  Unfortunately the foot pedal is broken, so I have to return it.  My other DeLonghi has lasted for about 20 years, so I will get a different model 
 Starting a magazine, as I have done, requires more than just an editorial plan. Woodard's book does a nice job of establishing what needs to go into an editorial plan but it completely ignores production issues, printing, advertising and funding. It's a little like telling someone how to design a car without mentioning that in addition to nice upholstery and great body work it needs an engine and tires. Put another way, she only talks about the part of the iceberg you can see. 
 I know Batali has become an American icon for Italian cooking, but this book is poorly written and assembled.  It is boring to thumb through with recipies that invite you to close the book and go to another.   I love Italy and both Northern and Southern cuisine, but this just doesn't work for me.  
 I hate how this book protrays the father, as an unattached lion who watches tv rather than helping his son bloom. I bought this book for my autistic son for Christmas, read it and put it in the trash. It makes Dads look uninvolved and is not a good portrayal at all. My husband is an excellent father and certianly would not choose to watch tv over helping my son learn.  Very dissapointed in this book and honestly surprised by all these positive comments 
 What a waste of time and money. 10 songs and hardly 20-30 minutes... of pure mediocrity.   Weezer is an amazing band...just don't bother on this one folks. Pinkerton and the Blue album are just classics. I Respect those guys a whole lot.  This is just...disappointing to say the least. It's just BAD, even for a Weezer fan. Lately Weezer has been trying to do with their nerd-rock label and are going for an almost loveable, adorable sort cutesy label.  I can't make myself clear enough. Don't go near this album, it's just the bottom of the corporate barrel. 
 Funny how people always vote a review to be "not helpful" when the reviewer expresses an opinion the voter doesn't like...  If you are a mickey d's binger who gets pissed off when people expose the fact that their food is utter garbage (or, if you are a Mc-Exec), you'll automatically hate my review or any others like mine.  But if you're here to really see what someone who hasn't been mc-brainwashed, hopefully this review will help you.   This book tells an accurate tale of the solely profit-focused means by which mcdonald's has grown into the fast food empire it is today.  Sure, it's a capitalistic wet dream.  But what this book doesn't cover is how Mickey-D's exloits workers, vales corporate profits over franchise success, and feeds people McGarbage that can't even be called food, all without being honest about its products or practices.  I'm sure devoted McEaters and McCapitalists will trounce my 1-star rating & review, but that really just proves my point.  Read this book.  But if you care to know the WHOLE story, be sure to also read something presenting another view - such as Fast Food Nation 
 I bought this from Amazon and I don't like it - I need to take 5 or 7 measures to be sure about the values, The diferent from the firt measures to the 7 measure is 3 degrees, I have a baby 6 months old and for me is a problem to take a lot of measure. In conclusion IS TO BIG INACCURATE.  
 Ugh. I did not even try to finish the book. It is full of sexual content. Not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature 
 The previous comments about these headphones being "distance-sounding" are right on the mark.  They have very little soundstage, and the mid-range sounded muddy to me.  Bass is decent, and they have treble, but do yourself a big favor.  Save up some more money and go for the Sennheiser HD-555's.  For about $150 you'll be getting a killer set of cans with great soundstage.  If you get a chance to A/B the difference between the HD-485's and HD-555's you will not be able to buy the 485's.  The HD-555 are very close in sound to Sennheiser's primo HD-595's, but cost $100 less than the 595's.  Go for the real value of the HD-555's.  If your really in a pinch for cans, I think the open-ear Koss KTX Titanium phones (for about $20 bucks) make a much nicer sound than the HD-485's. Comfort of the HD-485's is also a big issue.  They aren't nearly as comfortable for long wearing sessions as the Sennheiser 500-series headphones or the Koss.  In summary, the HD-485 is a mediocre headphone even at this price range. 
 Throughout reading this book, I went between various stages of enjoying it and thinking it utter rubbish. On the whole I would actually recommend people to read it despite the low rating. Its starts as a tirade against science, technology and claims that we are a plague apon the earth and basically (and happily in his eyes) heading for extinction. Ok possibly. But there is nothing to support his views. Nothing resembling an argument, just agngry rant mode. This is where the author is at his worst. His knowledge of science is extremly poor. (I am a scientist by trade).  The best part of the book is where the author gives his account of philosophy and attacks the usual Platonic tradition up through Kant. He attacks free will and follows the usual Nietzsche road of asking why liberal humanists seem to out-Christian the Christians when they no longer believe in God. This is all good but I think nothing that original.  On the whole I see this book as follows. His lack of progress point of view seems to be quite ignorant of writers such as Jared Diamond and Richard Wright and seems over pessimistic. Will we destroy the earth or at the very least destroy our civilization? Perhaps but I don't see any reason why we won't smarten up in time to avoid this fate. Certainly there is no argument in this book to convince me otherwise.  His attack on humanism is not all that original and as far is it is original it is not supported by argument. Richard Rorty does a much better job as taking liberal humanism apart. Also pure liberal humanism is somewhat of a straw man, at least to philosophers, though I admit that it lives on strongly in academic culture around universities. When I agree with Gray, I do so at the beginning and not because he convinces me. When I disagree with him, he simply seems silly. In the end I find that reading the book was enjoyable but mostly because it steered me into thinking about some interesting things and not because Gray makes any good arguments 
 It started working fine after waiting forever to charge it for the first time. Won't charge anymore and won't work! Didn't get much use out of it either! Not worth the price 
 Tolerance means accepting and no causing to conform to your beliefs. Which is what Muslims do. If Islam was not tolerant, then how are millions of muslims living in America today? How are they living in the same houses, going to American schools, listening to music, having to shop for clothes that are all inches of fabric, having to watch as kids in class make christmas cards in class or carve Halloween jack o lanterns, or not get to go to public swimming areas or Muslims teens not making out with teen guys? Islam makes no move to force anyone. Everyone is trying to confrom you. Everyone assumes that you do celebrate Christmas or eat pepporoni or wear shorts and tank tops. Because they think everyone should be like them and that's all. Sometimes it makes me tired and look back at how I've made it to high school as  Muslim, especially after 9/11. It comes from faith in God, my family, my friends- both Muslim and non-Muslims, and looking at all the good things and stringing those together and making those count more for the bad things. If only people coudl have that outlook on life, the world would not be such a bitter, criticizing place to be wher eeveryone has to constantly defend themselves. I can't seek to change everyone's opinion because it's not our place to tell people what's right and wrong. If you know about the true religion and Allah has opened your heart, it is up to him to let you accept Islam. In the end , if you keep good relations with others and have an open mind, understanding Islam and other religions, will not be a problem for you. And as assurance to other Muslims who are struggling and have become insecure about themselves around unwelcoming people,  " And had your lord so willed, He could surely have made all mankind one single community, but (He willed it otherwise, and so) they continue to have differences-all of the,, save those upon whom your Lord has bestowed HIs grace (by following His guidance on cohabiting with their differences and handling them peacefully). (11:118-119)  That is the simple message of Islam. Diversity is by God's will and it is useless to deabte against others that you are right and they are wrong or you are good and they are bad. Only God knows and that's how it is supposed to be. He will accept those people's prayers even those who aren't Muslims and are good people, we really don't know. No Muslim says if you're not Muslim, you go to Hell. That is completly out of line. ' Kaafir' does not mean infidel or unbeliever as many so called experts and uninformed people believe. It simply mean one who denies the clear fact of God's creation and favors and rejectss His message while realizing within oneself the truth that he/she opposes in words.  I think one of the main reasons people are against Islam and think it unfavorable, is becasue it is so different from our media and pop culture today. Islam to modern society is like an old fashioned time, whien people still read thier holy books, didn't have premarital sex, wore modest clothing, thought highly of educaiton, had good ties with their parents and family and respected their elders. Now in this free society, people want to do anything and can't stand those who have self control and such faith.  islam is easy to embrace if what your goal is , is to worship God in the simplest sense and keep good morals and values and be tolerant to others. Many religions also do this, so it shows islam is not some strange new idea.  thank you 
  In the post 9/11 world in which this book, subtitled "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity in the Middle East" was published, it should not be surprising that the reader would anticipate a discussion of the factors that led up to that awful day. This, however, is not to be found in What Went Wrong?  Instead we are treated to a cerebral discussion of various and sundry esoteric minutiae. We learn, for instance, that, "A distinguishing characteristic of Western music is polyphony, by harmony or counterpoint. This begins in its simplest form with the choir, in which matched voices sing different notes in a planned sequence to produce a combined effect; then comes the keyboard instrument, matching the ten fingers of the two hands, following different routes in a common purpose; and finally, the musical ensemble, from duets and trios to the full orchestra". While this is all well and good, and may even be mildly interesting on some academic level, it is hard to understand how it plays into a discussion of "The Clash Between Islam and Modernity..." that has led to the precarious times in which we live.  Or, on another note (harmony? counterpoint?) we learn that Robinson Crusoe was translated into Arabic by Butrus al-Bustani and published in the late 1850's. Big deal!  What we don't learn anything about is the rise of militant Islamism. There is no mention of Wahhabism or how this fundamentalist Islamic movement contributed to the rejection of modernity. The Muslim Brotherhood also is not to be found in the index, nor is there a mention of Sayyid Qutb, or his writing of the incendiary manifesto, Milestones. Furthermore, there is not a single reference to al-Qaeda, though Usama bin Laden does appear, albeit seemingly as an afterthought, in what appears to be a hastily added Afterword.  So what went wrong?  Beats me.. 
 I know a lot of people liked this book, but it didn't work for me. The main character and his buddies run around like chickens with their heads cut off, acting as if they have committed a huge crime. The problem is, they didn't. There is no crime. I talked to several cops and a prominent defense attorney about this plot, and it makes no sense. It would make sense if someone comes after the McGuffin, early on, but no one does, not until very late in the book. So most of the story has no foundation. 
 This book is mostly fluff about what to expect at the doctors and how to react to the questions and concerns of your doctor.  The test in the beginning of the book talks about various things you should do and not do when going to the hospital.  One of the answers is that you should remove your nail polish, another refers to your husband, instead of spouse.  Dr. Roiszen is obviously preaching to only the female segment of the patient market.  He also mistakenly implies that drug salespersons, known in the trade as "detail" salesman, only give him a little token gift and states that they provide a service which he compares to the neighborhood pharmacist.  Buy the book of its information, but read it with an open mind. 
 ...and dump it...great advice given in a previous review.   I think the "shame" about this book is that it glosses over some very interesting ideas with (in my opinion) some wholly unsupported and mostly un-related crap.   Talbot is to the theory of the Holographic Universe what Mark Furman was to the guilt of OJ Simpson.  Whatever truth there is to it will be hidden by his presentation of "false evidence" 
 Obviously skilled in her practice, the author really gets her hands dirty with this book.  The only problem I have with this book is that, well, I just didn't understand what she was talking about.  I've read many books about general practice and little about theory and, as the name of the book suggests with the inclusion of the word "theory," I expected to learn something about the theory of "witchcraft."  I just didn't.  It seemed like she was trying to be abstract and mysterious while battling the need to be technical and explanatory.  I felt, throughout the book, that she was being creatively fictional (and not the inspirational kind) rather than paying attention to the mission of the book.  Teach the reader about theory in a way that invites the public rather than a way that nurtures a mere minority 
 Anybody buying this book to learn some BW will be very much disappointed. Like the way the book is organised but older stuff. I can't beleive the greedy publiser is still selling this book. Not only they should stop selling, also should recall the book 
 First, in response to another review:  the Aishling Gray novels are by Katie McAllister, not MJD.  This book was so, so, SO, predictable. It was Betsy with gills.  Every other word seemed to be the "F" word, which is boring and unimaginative.  The plot is contrived, designed mainly so that the "heroine" can be put in a position of having multiple males attracted to her.  It was just crappy all around.  I got the feeling that MJD just plugged names into a standard formula on her word processor.  Having said that, I'm not giving up on Mary Janice.  I'm just not going to invest any more time or money in this fishy series. : 
   Now i must say that I'm a fat man. I'm at least 45 pounds over-weight but i don't make action movies and i don't ask people to pay good money to watch my fat self preform stunts and kung-fu moves. Someone please tell Mr. Seagal that he is past his action movie prime and needs to find new work 
 Pitbull's (A.K.A. Armando Christian Pérez) third album is "El Mariel" (2006) a twenty-one track release which features guest appearances from Fat Joe, Sinful, Bun B, Cubo, Redd Eyez, Wyclef, Oobie, Anjuli Stars, DJ Khaled Vybz Kartel, Ken-Y, Lil Jon, Ying Yang Twins, Trick Daddy & Rick Ross. This release is made up mostly of party/dance  Reggaeton track's and like a previous reviewer mentioned is not political (outside of intro/outro). Pitbull's track celebrating Fidel Castro's transfer of power "Ya se acabó" (A.K.A. It's Over) is not included on this release. Pitbull's singles are "Ya Chico" (Lengua Afuera) and Bojangles (Remix) feat. Lil Jon & Ying Yang Twins - painfully bad track's to listen to. Pitbull does alright celebrating being out of the dope game on the upbeat "Come See Me". "Jealousu" is in the same mold of the singles, while "Que Tu Sabes D'Eso" has Pitbull collaborating with Sinful, and Latin Hip Hop's most egotistical MC Fat Joe. On "Be Quiet" Pitbull reps living in the cocaine capital, in a track that makes me wish he would be quiet. Pitbull try's to show how hard people from his hood are on "Fuego" and "Rock Bottom". "Blood is Thicker Then Water" is a decent introspective collaboration between Pitbull and Redd Eyez. Wyclef and Oobie team up with Pitbull for another dedication to the ladies on "Jungle Feaver". Singer Anjuli Stars provides some soulful vocals to "Raindrops" a track dedicated to those who have past and about appreciating life. "Dime" is a purely Spanish track which features Puerto Rican Singer Ken Y. "Born N Raised" is the album largest collaboration and features appearances from DJ Khaled, Trick Daddy and Rick Ross - this cut was featured on DJ Khaled's "Listennn...The Album". I am not impressed with "El Mariel" but at the same think people who appreciate the reggaeton movement more then myself will enjoy this release.  
 I've read Sarum, London, & The Forest and really enjoyed them.  This book is not nearly as good.  It's just plain boring.  I kept reading with the hope that the book would improve in the next chapter - needless to say my hopes were dashed! I will probably give his next book a chance, after all, every author should be allowed a "dud" now and then 
 I do understand artists expanding their styles.. but this to me was too much of a departure from his other work. Intensive Care is a great album that I listen to alot, but this one is lacking in the sytle that I love so much from his work.. 
 Other than having a misleading title (maybe specifically due to a hidden agenda) these journalists write an informative book on Russia.  They certainly know about Russia but I failed to grasp what was wrong about Kremlin and Putin. Neither Kremlin nor Putin are angels, but as I see, Russians are living better than ever. Indeed many people from other unemployment hit ex-Soviet countries are having their Russki Dream in Russia.  12 years ago some people from our company went to Kazakhstan for business and on highway they had to take armed guards, and those pople do not count armpistols as arms ! Last winter we were traveling in southern Siberia in comfort, the roads were in very good condition, people were happy and I did not see visible environmental destruction. Is Putin guilty because there are heroin addicts in Irkusk ? Maybe he or his staff are shortsighted but how could the authors blame Putin, that I fail to understand.   The military is a similar issue. Yes, there is serious harassment there. But unless Putin argued that he had God's powers, how come he is expected to snap his fingers and solve every problem ?  Kremlin may have serious shortcomings, Russia may have lots and lots of corruption, they may be tough on international arena (yet they haven't declared a war for oil under a WMD lie) but this title fails to convince me that the rise of Kremlin is the end of revolution.   Just the opposite, the authors inability to support their arguments make me believe that they have an agenda!   Maybe other journalists will do a better job and disclose Putin's dark side instead of his shortcomings and their books will hopefully inform me. I am not a Putin fan but let's give him the right he deserves. Putin has been  working hard to reestabish laws in a country that was in total chaos just 15 years ago! There are lots of people who can not quit smoking in 15 years 
 I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul.  I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style.  Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much "simpler form."  I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know 
 I bought this book prior to starting an MBA program because even though I was about to begin a major investment of time and money, I still wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do with an MBA.  After reading this book I was no more sure than before I started 
 Being a Cussler fan for quite some time, having a first edition hardcover of "Raise the Titanic", I dutifully purchase and read every Cussler, and Cussler collaberated, piece of fiction and non-fiction. This title is a predictable read with only the names and places changed from previous reads to protect the innocent. Granted it's interesting and all that, and some of the scientific stuff is momentarily thought provoking, but in the end you already know the story  Bad guy going to take over the world, world in enviromental danger, good guy gets girl, car chase and everybody saved. Maybe I'm just in a cranky mood today, but thats what I think of it, and I'll probably buy the next one 
 Another jingoistic, poorly theorized work of fiction. There are countless of these cheap "doom-and-gloom" scenarios. Save your money and play Command and Conquer: Generals. Because really, that is all this book is, another fantasy videogame reading "end-times."   There is absolutely nothing inevitable about a clash between China and America. Neither state has anything to gain from such a clash, nor does China have any reason to overthrow American hegemony. China is greatly benefitting from the Pax Americana without paying the costs of this system. If aggression occurs, it will be due to inept American foreign policy.  And on a final note, Bush has made it quite clear that the U.S. military will not support Taiwan if it were to formally declare its independence. 
 This is definitely one of the worst cd purchases i've made.  The Cd is poorly organized, and most of the music isn't as good as one would think.  the songs that ARE worth listening to though, are: Disc 1: 8. Halifax - "sydney" 11. Say Anything - "Woe" 15. I can make a mess like nobody's business - "The best happiness money can buy" 56. Patent Pending - "Los Angeles"  Disc 2: 1. Hellogoodbye - "Homewrecker" 5. Jack's Mannequin - "Kill the messenger" 8. Matchbook Romance - "My Eyes Burn"  Other than that, this is really a minimal value Cd, in my opinion 
 After reading the storyline of this movie, it seems like a framing movie, so I didn't even bother to watch it because framing movies piss me off.   
 Nice product before they decided to save a few pennies - I have purchased seven, but now it is made with out the handle - so if that was part of the atraction of this case, note that the discription says 'sturdy padded handle' -- NOT! 5 STARS if it still had the handle or if you don't need one 
 I'm getting a little concerned about this review system because people are clearly misusing it and reports of abuse have gone ignored.  I am no fan of Bill O'Reilly and this novel is not the greatest, but there is no excuse for intentionally misstating the content of a book or using this space as a soapbox for irrelevant opinions...especially if, from the looks of some of these reviews, a reviewer have not actually read this book.  We need to set our opinions and agendas about the author aside and review the book on its own merits.    RE: a previous reviewer's statement that "under aged kids are being molested in this book by sicko [...]".  The character in question was a villain who briefly appeared -- a young ghetto dealer who was having sex with a 15-year-old when the hero/vice cop apprehended him.  In fact, O'Reilly is so busy preaching and pontificating in this scene that he forgets he is supposed to be telling a story: "Obviously, he preferred oral sex to oral hygiene."    That's the main problem with the novel.  He doesn't understand how a story is told, and it doesn't appear that his editor exercised too much control over easily correctable gaffes.  He interrupts an arrest scene with a comment in parentheses: "Homicide detectives are required to wear suits on duty".  You get the picture.  The details are not horribly original, but nothing is stolen outright that I can pinpoint.  And some scenes and subplots were actually funny.  I have a feeling it could have been a good novel with a decent amount of editing and advice.     There is nothing gratuitous, [...], or intentionally [...] in this book.  It is just mediocre -- but I did stick with it to the very end.  If you like media-related mysteries or O'Reilly, check it out of the library like I did.  Fulfilling my curiosity about what kind of story someone with his background would tell was worth a few hours of my time.     
 Obviously, the rantings of a depressed, selfish and self-righteous woman, who for if these issues were not enough of a challenge, believes in the fraudulent and assanine thinking of Freud. To bad she didn't kick the bucket before she had the opportunity to launch such a demented attack on the very core of society, and what brings meaning to life: family. This sad woman's physical appearance, almost confirms the above alone - just a miserable, frustrated witch.  
 It's obvious that all these glowing reviews are by a small band of loyal groupies from the Kay Sheppard Yahoo group.   It's about time to start asking some questions here.  Like, if Kay Sheppard is an "expert", then where did she get her training?  What university?  Where is her research?  Where was it conducted?  What exactly do these so-called credentials she uses mean?  Where is ANY science to back up or give credence to anything she states?  If you can't eat white rice, but you can eat white potatoes, where in the science of biochemistry does that seeming contradiction support itself?  The book and the entire premise that it's based on is entirely made up out of folk lore, oral tradition, junk science and food quackery, and it capitalizes on the sad and lonely search for something, anything, to help dysfunctional eaters stop eating destructively.    For all the book's claims, there is zero evidence that the 'food plan' works, or that any statistically relevant number of people ever achieve "abstinence" beyond short and sporadic episodes.  Since Sheppard has no peer-reviewed research or any documentated legitimacy to the claims promoted by the book, it has to go to the same junk pile that every other diet book goes.  
 I purchased this dvd because I own the 2nd one and like it so much.  Boy, was I disappointed!  The abs diet people must have decided to create the second dvd because this one needed a good edit.  The second dvd covers basically the same exercises but with better instruction and form.  Skip this one and buy the Abs Diet Workout 2 
 I have Goddess bras, and it seems that each style has it's own sizing.  The love at first sight bra fits wonderfully, while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be 
 Read all of Chuck's other books and this is the worst of the bunch.  SD&CP was funny.  This is just a bad collection of articles that he has written.  If you want to read about femal cover bands, or the scene in Fargo ND when he was 23, go right ahead.  It feels like you are reading the Village Voice cover to cover...one crappy article at a time.  Torture 
 Like other reviewers, I love the layout, organization, and variety of projects.  HOWEVER, be aware that this book is full of pattern errors.  For that reason, I would not recommend this book to beginners, or to those who rely on patterns for exact directions.    Here are a sampling of errors I found.  I haven't written out details of the corrections; that's Storey Publishing responsibility.    The Gossamer Shell Scarf (p. 55) tells you to cast on 20, and then knit according to the pattern.  However, the pattern stitch requires more than 20 stitches.  The Twisted Knee-High Sock (p. 44) contains incorrect instructions about arranging stitches before the heel flap.  It has has incorrect directions for turning the heel.  There are others - be sure to read the other reviews! 
 The problem with this book is that it was written as a textbook with very little practal advice and no real "know-how" methods.  Similar to virtually all business books written by professors for colleges, this book falls very short in equipping would-be entrepreneurs with the insight, skills, and know-how needed to become successful entrepreneurs.  I would not waste your money on this book at any price.    If you want a great book on the topic, I highly recommend "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs".   This little-known book is rapidly becoming THE STANDARD for entrepreneurs.  
 What a shame that spell-check can't distinguish among a and an, their and there, misplaced commas, and then and than. I found 47 such errors in this book, and find it apalling that a name publisher never had it actually "read" before printing. Shame on them. And the title? Bears no resemblance to the subject matter or treatment.  White writes very well, when his ideas make it past a rudimentary grammar check. But the book seems to be a loose collection of magazine articles, with little overriding messages. Sure, we know science has rivalries, and that scientists can be prima donnas. Anything else new here? Not much. I'd pass on this one 
 I thought that I ordered the textbook and got a type of study guide instead.  The title of the textbook and the title of the 'studyguide' CANNOT be the same on Amazon - that is where I made my mistake!! 
 I, like a lot of others was kind of annoyed when I saw another issue out.  I own the extended and theatrical releases already.  BUT, I had to buy them to see the "Never before behind the scenes documentary". To be honest, I wasn't impressed.  A few funny things, but all in all...I could have lived without it.  It's just a bunch of stuff slapped together with no rhyme or reason.  The Extended version extra material is so far superior.  That's my opinion. But like me, you may just have to have it! Shame on the greedy movie companies for doing this to us! If you don't own the movies and are generally not into the extras, this is definitely a good way to go,  You get both versions and in a very smart package 
 Reasons:  1. Faulty battery cover design.  The battery cover comes off time I remove the timer from a metal surface.  2. The protective glass is cloudy - making the timer numbers hard to see.  3. The alarms are not very audible.  4. The magnet "unglued" itself within the first three days of use 
 Parents and children who loved the other Leap Frog DVDs about letters, words and reading will find this one disappointing.   Advertised as beginning math, this one is mixed up in its focus, spending quite a bit of time on recognizing the numbers from 0 to 10 (especially zero) and relating them to “quidgets”, then quickly jumping to addition and subtraction without sufficient explanation or introduction of the concepts.  Starting with simple counting, by the end of the 35 minutes, they’re showing us ten times tables up to one hundred.  Very young children will probably like the repetitive cowboy “numbers” song, and may even stick around for the “circus” acts and accompanying slapstick routines, but the concepts advance too quickly for this age group.  Kids who already know their numbers won’t learn anything new from the beginning of the presentation, but then again, they probably won’t learn anything from the rest of it either.  Clearly one should not expect kids to learn math in 35 minutes, which makes you wonder what they were thinking when they made this one.  A more sensible approach would be to have different DVDs for each level, as they did in the reading series, so that they could spend more time going into the nitty-gritty, and making it fun.  This one is a rush job, and was not properly thought out for the intended audience.  Definitely not a tool you should count on to introduce your kids to math.    Amanda Richards, May 4, 2006  
 Sure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss (Jinpachi) is really cheap and lame! Even at the "easy" difficulty, just a couple of hits from this freak and you're dead! The Devil Within mini-game is also stupid, some levels are just impossible and too hard. I wouldn't mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here, not to mention some save points are hidden. Imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles, spending around 2 hours or more to get to the boss level, then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can't save your game, then you're gonna have to redo the entire level again!!! That is one sick stupid game design! The only reason I'm playing this mini-game is just to get the hidden items 
 There is no other explanation. The following quote is all you really need to know to prove that Andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is. "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." - Andrea Dworkin. If a man were to say something like this, I'm sure she'd call for his arrest. 
 Kyla's irrational attachment to her dead husband was increadibly annoying.  She needed counseling and it doesn't look like she had any.  Someone else mentioned to skip this book and go to another.  I will read another Sandra Brown book, but if the next one is as silly as this one, then I'll be through with her 
 As a huge fan of "Chiefs", Stuart Woods first novel, I decided to give Dark Harbor a try.  What I found was a predictable plot, gratuitous sex, and all the marks of a "spit out thinly plotted books" machine.  Stone Barrington is informed that his distant cousin has allegedly ended his family's life and left Stone as the executor of his will.  When it is discovered that the cousin worked for the C.I.A., Stone and company begin to investigate his death to determine if it had anything to do with his clandestine work.  As they investigate and the suspects materialize, the plot grows more and more predictable.  Run from this one 
 I found this book rather...well...lame.  To me, and this is just me, the information was nothing that you could not find on most basic websites.  I would look elsewhere 
 Filling a book with applications is no good when you compress the theoretical material. This book, although nice on the application side, falls short when the going starts to get rough. This book has chapters that are not even worth reading, like the chapter on Eigenvectors and Linear Transformations. In general, the explanations are so short or lack demonstrations to a point where you end up memorizing theorems (a demonstration is not a paragraph in cursory English saying "blah, blah, as we saw previously, blah, blah, blah." If you doubt me, do that on an exam and see what the professor writes in red ink, later). Is that what you want ? The serious student will then waste his/her precious little time trying to fill in the gaps with other books. I'm not even talking from the standpoint of abstractness and rigour. I'm just saying explanations are lacking.  A reviewer said some problems are hard to do with the text, and 98% are done by rote. This is correct. The "hard" problems are hard because the book is lacking in abstraction. Another reviewer said this book will please engineers more than mathematicians. I feel this is correct too. Applied mathematics students should also avoid this book. I don't think this book prepares you for "the next level", where you'll be working with real problems. I don't see this book preparing the student for computational linear algebra, and I don't think there's nearly enough matrix theory here. Also, I think the book has that American textbook style where things are broken into small pieces and fit into nice-looking boxes and the text tends to loose its flow and you tend to loose the conections. It's not a good writing style for my taste. It's kind of like a Calculus book. They lie to you first, and then they teach you "Advanced Calculus" and "Analysis." Personally, I don't like that approach, because I think it's a time waster. And, you might not get a second chance to ge it right as an undergraduate (this is true for engineering students at my institution). Quickly immerse yourself in "Matrix Analysis and Applied Linear Algebra" by C. D. Meyer and avoid this book; or, another great book (and everybody says so, because it is), Gilbert Strang's "Linear Algebra and Its Applications." The virtues I see on this book are carefully chosen illustrations that help to convey meaning to the theorems by geometric aid and the intertwined applications "appetizers."  All in all, though, it'll do you more harm than good. Students who enjoyed this book have probably haven't read any other. This review refers to the 2nd edition 
 Had high hopes when I got this book. Sadly letdown. The book gives a tired old treatment of using a black list to check against the header of a mail message. Now not all spammers forge the header. But many do, as known for years. And they don't just forge the From line. They can also forge the Received lines.  When the author wrote the previous review, he mentioned the Received header lines. But, in general, for an ISP, the only valid header info is what the ISP itself writes. Received lines not written by the ISP can also be forged.   So using a black list on a header can easily be defeated by a spammer. And is being done so by many of them.  But Schwartz goes on to say that SA can now apply the black list against the body links. GREAT! Awesome. This is the key difference between 3.0 and the earlier stuff. Yet, when I went thru the book, I did not see any mention of this. Okay, perhaps I missed it. But if the book actually talks about it, it is in a very obscure fashion.  The new ability in 3.0 is seminal. Because while a spammer can forge headers, if he wants users to click through to his site, he has to write a valid address for himself. When AOL implemented this idea [not using SA] earlier this year, they said it led to the first documented decrease in spam they'd seen.  I repeat- if the book didn't mention the new 3.0 ability, it is grossly deficient. If it did mention it, but scantily, ditto. It certainly deserves at least as much space as was given to Mr Bayes.    
 Thomas Szasz has become a better writer since he wrote "The Myth of Mental Illness" in 1961. It is clearer in this book that he is just smearing psychotherapy than in the former book, where his smears are better hidden amongst erudite references to twentieth-century philosophy and other confusing stuff. That's why this book, although better written, isn't as brilliant as the former, in my opinion. Psychotherapy has posed an enormous threat to people who don't want their ego-compensations exposed. The power of the backlash against the discoveries of Freud should not be underestimated, and this would account for the enormous market for the works of Thomas Szasz, which are just pure anti-psych propaganda 
 ...because I have! In his book on ACC basketball. In some cases, he  didn't change a word....just repeated the same anecdotes. I am really glad that I didn't pay for this book because I would have been really angry about re-reading old material.  If you like reading about ACC basketball, and you haven't read Feinstein's verrrry similar book, you will probably like it.  If you like reading about Big East basketball when you're not reading about ACC basketball...you might like it.  If you think that the basketball universe is bigger than the ACC, the Big East, and Feinstein's apparent obsession with Bob Knight, save your money for another book.  It's too bad, really. Feinstein is a good writer. I guess the big buckets of cash he gets from each book he writes has finally caused him to lower his standards 
                 This review is in reference to "Nancy Drew: Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon Game + Strategy Guide" edition.                                               I've played 3 or 4 of the Drew games.  This one played faster and was over before the time it took to install the game.                                               Before I had installed 'Blue Moon Canyon', I had installed "Morrowind the Game of the Year Edition", which sold for five dollars less than 'Blue Moon Canyon'.  Morrowind is a huge 4 disc game that has, at the bare minimum, 400 hours of gameplay, and possibly might literally be endless.  The entire Morrowind set had been installed and up and running within 15-20 minutes.                                    After I had installed and played 'Blue Moon Canyon' we installed and got up and running "Age of Mythology Gold" also within 20 minutes. This is another massive game, a Real Time Strategy game that included the expansion pack "The Titans". Both 'Mythology' games were completely installed.  This is another game that can be played and explored for years.  The two game set sold for five dollars more than 'Blue Moon Canyon', or the original full retail price of the strategy guide edition.                               "The Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon" took so long to download...we went out for dinner and let it download while we were gone.  We have a P4 at 3.2Ghz, an 80GB HD, of which only 23GB were used, and 1.5 GB of RAM.  There is no reason on earth why Nancy Drew games should take so long, over an hour, to download...unless their copy protection program conflicted with our Toshiba Super-Multi Drive drivers.                                 The actual installation was not as painful as the download.  What was painful was the gameplay.  I had a lot of fun playing the 'Secret of the Old Clock'.  Whereas most of the Amazon user reviews came across as lukewarm to the game, I liked playing the golf game, and the car chase, and the "bank shots" of reflective light beams to be aligned.  I even felt proud when I finally got the sewing completed.                                  I knew that the Drew games wouldn't deliver the value that the two games (mentioned above) did.  But after the reading the reviews of 'Blue Moon' I expected to have more fun than I did with 'Secret', even though I knew it would be short lived.                             What a let down.  The game was over in two or three hours. Most of the gameplay was a memory test of what order what button was pushed or stick was knocked over, or  which way the track leaned to.  The 'arcade' games in the General Store were just hit the button or in this case 'click the mouse'. You didn't even have to look.  The most complicated task was getting a piece of paper to do a rubbing. It was very boring.                             Between the price, the concern over the length of the download, the most unimaginative gameplay set to walking back and forth on a train, I cannot recommend this game as being fun. It had a few moments with the Math/scale problems but it wasn't enough to carry the game or balance the huge amount of needless dialogue the player has to endure listening to.                                                  I realize I'm an adult, but the eight year-old little girl (I bought it for) lost interest after the first 15 minutes.  She was wiser than I.                        Sorry Nance, this one is a waste of money, and might contribute to hardware damage with driver conflicts.                                 marf   
 Visually, the book is rewarding.  The author has photographed her specimens imaginatively, compelling the reader to look twice to identify the subject matter.  The text, however, is a great disappointment.  Not  only is the format confusing (as some reviewers have already pointed out),  but with a writing style so disjointed and without an appreciable sense of  structure, the book leaves us readers floundering in a fishpond,  desperately seeking the shore 
 Jesus Christ is Yahweh.  Yancey doesn't understand that.  God is the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.  God NEVER changes.  God is Holy Trinity.  God in the Old Testament is Holy Trinity.  God in the New Testament is Holy Trinity.  God now is Holy Trinity.  When Jesus Christ comes back, God will be Holy Trinity.  God will be Holy Trinity forever as He was before the Creation of the World.  Thus, Jesus Christ who is God the Son is Yahweh of the Old Testament.  Anyone who teaches otherwise is going to HELL because he doesn't know Christ personally 
 My recommendation would be to read the Bible and leave Tim Lahaye alone. If you like, put a picture of Jesus, color and ethnicity your choice, on the wall. Feel good. Get Tim Lahaye's diabolical nonsense out of your life. Think about the friends you have, not the enemies. This man specializes in pointing fingers at people, known to God, but poorly understood by Tim Lahaye 
 Maybe the author wrote this book as part of his therapy.  It could have been such a nice book.    To read about something as idiotic as putting a small dog and a weasel into a barrel and closing the lid until one killed the other is just too much.  The dog is the one left alive, but has been hurt so badly they have to shoot it in the head.  Then there is the pig mating scene.  Yes, we all know "it" happens, but my child does not need to read about "thrusting" and blood running down the gilt's leg.  The boar owner makes a comment that the next time the gilt will stand still for it.  Great message for young girls.  When I asked children what they remember about the book, they tell me the above stories.  One did not even remember the boy's father dies, but remembered the above graphic situations.  Much is lost on them.    The graphic situations ruined what could have been a good book 
 I purchased this item judging by its comfort factor. All's well except the buckles do not have pins to hold the straps in place. The straps slip off occassionally, causing the shoes to come loose. 
 The authors didn't go through in details how to calculate Present worth, installments, etc.Before using this book, it is better to read Principles of Engineering Economy textbook. 
 Although the story should be a great read for children having difficulties with split families. The page where Elizabeth ask "Who do you love the best," could plant in a childs mind that one must make a choice as to which parent do you love the best, or even cause the child to wonder if he/she is loved the "best".  The book would have been excellent had it not been for this one page.  I suggest it be re-written 
 Then this will not work on your console.But if you have the huge old ps2 console then this will work on you console.If you do have the slim console then you should get a game shark 
 At the end of this confusing, and often difficult to read, book the author puts forward the view on the last two pages that the human race should abandon art as something out-dated and work instead on personality development.  Personality development?  Imagine a world with no movies, no music, no TV, no art of any sort, just people sitting around "developing their personalities" in their heads.  Give me a break.  Despite Mr. Rank writing this 431 page opus of obscurity, he must not understand much about artists if he thinks they would be satisfied with a substitute of this sort.  He misses the kinship artists feel towards their art, and the fact that often artists enjoy performing their art for its own sake, not merely for an interest in immortality.  Artists enjoy the feeling of power that comes with creation, and they need the relief and catharsis that comes from creating something beautiful. Personality development could never replace this, since art is a means for the artist to express himself not create himself.  In this little flaccid daydream of Mr. Rank's I detect a desire to have psychology replace art, since psy. is concerned with the development of personalities.  In retrospect, thinking back over the previous portions of the book, it seems as if Mr. Rank's whole theory of art is constructed in order to make artistic creation seem identical to his theories; to make it seems as if art and psychology functioned by the same mechanisms.  This made it easy for him to topple his own house of cards after its meticulous construction with one final blow. ***** I gave this book an extra star only because it had some interesting things to say about ancient civilization and the history of art.  However, I am sure there are countless heaps of other books that cover the same subject matter more interestingly.  I see no reason anyone should buy this book.  It's certainly not what I was looking for.  What a waste of money! ***** This book was written in the 1930's I believe.  After 70 years I think it's save to say that Mr. Rank's sour obituary can be dismissed.  Good art is still being produced and will be produced as long as human beings have the capacity to dream.  True, there have been declines in the standards of art, but this doesn't not show a decay in the concept of art itself.  Rather, there are two factors responsible for the decline.  First, mass media makes the public more accessible to the artist.  The culture is flooded with the worthless debris of talent hacks every year.  But there are still great works being made.  Second, the general trend of the public towards lower and lower taste makes for a bad reception of works of genius, and clears the field for the afore-mentioned debris. **** Beyond this there are many factors that cause different developments in art history.  For instance, representational art saw a decline with the invention of photography, and abstract and non-representational art saw a growth in popularity.  There have been long periods thought-out history, such as the middle ages, where art standards have dropped severely, but art has always emerged victorious in the end.  Art has been with us from the beginning.  It will be with us until the end, regardless of how wet blankets like Mr. Rank feel about it 
 .....isn't that someplace in Florida?  It would be interesting to see what old VW would have made of that section of the planet had she decided to incorporate it into her novel.  She was, however, a member of a clique which chose to incarcerate itself in the English Cotswolds for the main part.  Ah, wait...I feel an analogy coming on.....nope, it's gone!  There's nothing amazing about 'Orlando' it was a vehicle for Heaven knows what hang-up Woolf was pretending to endure at the time.  No one in that era wrote for entertainment or pleasure, it was always to make some point or other.  Thankfully the 'real' focus of most of these idle rants are lost in the mists of time.  It does, however, contain some cute imagery; the bit where the River Thames suddenly becomes unfrozen is good....I regard the presumed ancestors of Michael Winner hosting the mass banquet condemned to a watery eternity sans iceberg as semi-historic.    All in all, this tome should be read and sneered at .... like all  such books.  One shouldn't focus on the overall plot but the few mini-gems sparsely scattered throughout the text 
 I had to purchase this book for a university studio photography course...unfortunately, the instructor never even flipped through it.  It is by far the WORST photography book, really the worst book I have ever purchased!  There are typo's, the "example photos" and instruction sometime are not the same.  The projects are lame and really teach nothing.  I would not recommend this book under any circumstances...AVOID AT ALL COST!!! [... 
 Once put together, this toy is a great looking pirate ship. Just don't try playing with it. The Lego pieces do not stick firmly together, so even the slightest touch results in the entire ship falling apart. After several frustrating attempts to play with the toy, my five year old gave up on it. We finally used model glue to glue the Legos together so that it wasn't a complete waste of money. If you don't have the time or patience to do the same, this toy isn't for you 
 To be honest, I never really had much fate in Video game adaptations. Most of them in the past have failed miserably. Here, Resident Evil Apocalyse has made it even worse. A continuation from the first so-so Resident evil film. Umberella have decided to re-open the Hive, unknowingly letting the T-Virus out throughout the city, turning the people of Racoon city into zombies. Firsts of all, I love the Resident Evil video games( especially Resident Evil 4 ). Its what gave me encouragment to see this film. Before I actually saw this film I was thinking that this might be in some way decent. To be honest, it didnt even seem in anyway related to the Resident Evil series.   When it comes to bringing these video games to the big screen you need to ask yourself, What makes the actuall game itself such a success? If you take Silent Hill for instance. Probably one of the few video game adaptations that was an actuall success. They have really taken the Silent Hill video game features into perspective and shown us how this is actually done. It actually felt like Silent Hill. But in this case, it looks like the Resident Evil video games where just thrown aside. There is absolutely nothing meaningful from the video games that was put into this film and absolutely nothing atmospheric about it that even makes it feel like Resident Evil environment. And the atmospheric soundtrack from the video games have been replaced by Heavy Metal music. It felt like an absolute joke. It seems that they didnt even take the Resident Evil video games into consideration and without it, this film lost all its perspectives and has no meaning for the Resident Evil title. This is just a pointless action sci-fi. Film makers really need to take these video game adaptions more seriously. This is an insult to the Resident Evil video game series 
 For one thing Cantor claims the ancient Greeks were so gay. I dipute that. I think ancient Greeks were just living in a very temperature-wise hot, sunny climate and as a result were often semi-nude or even nude with people of the same sex. The affection the same sex showed each other was traditional and very most likely didn't usually include the act of doing it. Also, on other homosexual points it's somewhat wrong of Cantor to point out gay English kings. Even though a defense of this could be that Cantor was only pointing a fact in this instance I have studied medieval history for years and never before heard of this terrible fact of these particular English monarchs engaging in the Bibilically sinful act of homosexuality. A personal point on something different I also got of bored of hearing how English and Spanish people ate. Hey neither of these groups are noted for their great food (tacos are mexican food). Talk more about what italians ate in the middle ages please! Cantor has done better writing. I prefer his book on the plague to this one by far!    
 We read this book for our book club, and the overall feeling was that it was a quick, easy read, but very predictable and a little over the top.  We all agreed that we wouldn't be passing this book on to friends to read as we did not enjoy it that much 
 It's a pleasant-enough book to get from the library and look at for 15 minutes, but I don't think it's worth the price to buy.  These are one-of-a-kind quilts from the covers of Quilter's Newsletter Magazine and I can't imagine anyone wanting to replicate these patterns.  
 This rates as one of the poorer mysteries I have read in years.  It was truly an ordeal to finish, and I am left wondering why I bothered.  It has a totally unbelievable plot and inconsistent characters, many of whom are  stereotypical creations of little or no interest.  I was particularly  amused when the detective was told to "make a few inquiries at the  transsexual shoe shop, giving the size and style of the shoe from the  corpse".  In all of LA, I am sure there is just one known  "transsexual shoe shop".  Please.  I suspect Ms. LaPlante has  better material, but this is a poor example better left unread.  I would  give it less than one star, but unfortunately that's not an option 
    Lets be honest, no one really likes this band. Its all bandwagon, afraid of appearing stupid and unadventurous nonsense. If tame punk with Geddy Lee(of Rush great band)meets Diamanda Galas(great singer and composer) vocals is your cup of tea then by all means pick this up. But please there is far too much interesting music out there to waste your time with this. Check out Ash Ra Tempel, Robbie Basho, Scratch Acid, Boris, Dalek, and Borbetomagus instead 
 I normally do not review books, but I feel so strongly negative towards this one.  The book is very dry - there is an example at the beginning of each chapter to serve as a motivation, but other than that, the examples are very plain. In addition, he does not give enough material to work all of the problems. The examples are very basic and full of horrid notation. There are a lot of holes in the logic as well.  A plus side is that the algorithms are not difficult to implement with only a few notational quirks to deal with (but none of them have detailed explanations).   From a student's perspective, you should steer clear away from this one 
 I was very disappointed with this book.  The information was outdated and the section on women's running was inaccurate.  
 This book is inexplicably influential, probably due to its catchy but ultimately meaningless title. Barber fails to convincingly analyze an interesting thesis, instead delivering an exasperating 300 page-long list of every single thing on Earth that he disagrees with. Barber contends that natural human political behavior results in smaller and smaller ethnic enclaves trying to separate themselves from the larger world, while unchecked global capitalism is erasing ethnic flavor with bowdlerized mass-culture sameness. Interestingly, Barber contends that these two contrary movements are actually in an unholy alliance, using each other's excesses as excuses for their anti-democratic behavior. That is a fascinating thesis, which makes the weaknesses of this book all the more infuriating.   The first part of the book is an interminable tirade of lists within lists, of cultural trends that Barber disdains, in an avalanche of complaints that is not analytical but merely selective and arbitrary. It's all tied together with attempts at "edgy" pop culture references, made-up terminology (like the annoying "infotainment telesector"), and pseudo-intellectual quotations and namedropping. All is lumped together unconvincingly under the anemic term "McWorld," which is so vague and all-inclusive as to become meaningless. In his never-ending examples of how recent cultural trends are damaging the freedom and intelligence of the masses, Barber merely comes across as a condescending snob who thinks his own interests are superior, or a curmudgeon who thinks everything was better back in the good old days, or both. In the second part of the book, Barber proceeds to throw obtuse political science theories at various world hotspots, in which tribalism and separatism are damaging the integrity of nation-states. His umbrella term for this phenomenon is the dangerously loaded term "Jihad." Note that this book was published back in 1995, so that word was not as prevalent in Western discourse as it is now, but Barber still uses the term as a loose descriptor which is likely to offend both devout Muslims and ardent anti-Islamists.  When it comes to the specifics, many reviews here and elsewhere list out the numerous flaws in Barber's arguments, and there are so many of them that a lot of reviews are necessary for the task. You can agree or disagree with various critiques of Barber's contentions based on your own personal politics. But everyone will probably conclude that in this book's final section he does not deliver on the ironic implications of his initially intriguing thesis (embodied in the book's title), and simply forwards borrowed theories on civil society and the public sector. Overall, this book is mostly the longwinded grumblings of a nostalgic know-it-all who portentously predicts doom for every single cultural and political reality of the modern world. [~doomsdayer520~ 
 Movies For The Blind is one of the top ten best hip-hop records ever made. In Stoney Lodge is perhaps one of the most empowering/gut wrenching songs about bipolar disorder ever recorded. Agent Orange, while not new for the disk, is an excellent use of A Clockwork Orange imagery. The list goes on and on. So why then did this album fall flat? On one hand Def Jux is warping him to fit there new "politically conscious" label image and turning him into an Eminem knock off (which is ridiculous because Eminem bit cage's style hard) just listen to peeranoia, and on the other Cage is not the angry twenty something he once was. Cage is now on the thirty year old patient who wants to get sober, and get his life straight. In that sense the album works, it is pretty honest at times. Yet I feel that this somewhat contradicts what happened with Movies. He makes the apology, "everything I said on Movies because of my buzz." This hurts his credibility as an artist. And a line like "this time around I'm just one of you fu8king depressed kids." who is he, Slug? I don't feel the album lived up to the impossible standards set by Movies, yet I am interested to see where he takes this new angle. Overall, it's worth a look, but nothing special 
 When the original Cold Fusion press conference was held on 3-23-89, the reaction of the physics establishment in the first world was immediate , orchestrated and highly hostile. Mr. Taubes book is an effort to  spin-doctor an entire area of emerging global science out of exisitence .  As of 3-23-99 there are over 3000 peer reviewed scientific papers available  in this area of science with nearly every institution connected with  nuclear phenomena having checked in. Mr. Taubes confines himself with  attacking Drs. Fleischmann and Pons during the begining few years of this  controversy and ignoring the mountain of official  replications:  EPRI, US  Naval Weapons Lab China Lake,  U of Minnesota, MITI et al... If you want to  see how "black propaganda" works read this tome. I recommend it  to anyone getting involved in the "new Energy" movement to get a  temper of the opposition.  As Lord Macaulay put it over a century ago  " If a big enough commercial interest were threatened, even Newton's  law of Gravity would be called into question".

 I bought this DVD based on reviews here on Amazon. I won't fault others for thier position, it's just a matter of personal taste. For me this was a big disapointment. The story leaves a lot to be desired. The character Walker (Lee Marvin) gets away with a lot of crimes he shouldn't have. The direction seemed to be a practice in doing something different, but it failed. I'm sorry I bought this DVD 
 I was disappointed in this DVD.  I have done a decent amount of yoga and pilates; however, I couldn't believe how difficult this was.  The first workout was practically impossible for me, as it required SO much upper body strength.  It put a ton of strain on my wrists.  Kristin McGee is lifeless, and she never explained what parts of the body each exercise was suppossed to be targeting as most instructors do.  Kristin tells you if you're a beginner to watch so-and-so for modifications, however, the way the DVD is edited makes this impossible as the "beginner" person isn't always in view.  This DVD left me annoyed and discouraged.  If you are looking for a total body, low-impact workout, I highly reccommend Carmen Electra's "Fit to Strip."  Unlike Kristin McGee, Carmen is very fun and down to earth.  She makes you feel like you're working out with your best friend.  I also reccommend Winsor Pilates, Tae Bo, and The Firm dvds instead of this one 
 Reading this book is a little like reading the Kama Sutra. Both books discuss fascinating subjects but readers are given far more information than they are ever likely to use in practice.  Some critical weaknesses. First, there is the number of metrics: there are 114 (and some metrics are divided into sub-metrics, too). Another problem is that while the authors describe a broad range of metrics and scales, they are often less than informative as to how measurement is to be accomplished. They maintain, for example, that brand awareness should be measured on a scale of 1-7; but they give little information on how this notoriously sensitive subject can be quantified accurately. The same is true of metrics such as customer intentions and loyalty.  Finally, does this book really solve the problem of how to measure marketing performance or payback? On the whole, it does not. Nor does it discuss the key decisions that managers must make about marketing, and this lack of decision-orientation is the biggest weakness of the book.  Managers need guidance that links with real world decisions.    Much better alternatives are: - Marketing and the Bottom Line (ISBN: 0273661949) - Marketing Payback (ISBN: 0273688847 
 There was enough redemption and entertainment in the first 2 books to have me reading the third, but what a way for Sinjun to go!  I liked Sinjun, I liked Colin, the Scottish adventure and running away from the overprotective brothers is great... So why does our Strong and Manly hero have to ruin it all by subjugating the eager and talented Sinjun to HORRIBLE sex.  And later in the book when Sinjun decides to "let" her husband hurt her, it's DISGUSTING.  Having a man force sex on a woman is NOT romantic!  Rewrite the book to take out the rape and I would love it 
 I was overwhelmed by the choices, and selected this model, in part, because of the reasonal price.  I had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product, but I decided there was only a small possibility of that happening.    The instructions said to use the lowest setting initially, which certainly made sense.  However, the INSTRUCTIONS said to move the adjustment "toward the tip", which turned out to be the highest, not the lowest setting!  The diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the LARGER opening, but I read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later.  The spray was very powerful and actually "hurt", especially when it was by my tooth with a crown.    The next day I tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink, not in my mouth!  It felt wonderful on the lower setting!  I reread the directions again (and again over the next several days) to see if the error was mine or theirs.  I still think the directions were not written properly.  The third day I had trouble getting any spray at all.  This continued for about a week, some days getting more or less, but never a full spray ON ANY SETTING!  My guess is that it was in a permanent "pause" mode. I gave up and pursued returning the item.  It needed to be returned to an "authorized repair", which luckily was only a few miles away (there were only three in my state).  The repair man had told me, over the phone, it was a discontinued model and hadn't been made in about  a year.  When he looked at it, he found it had been made in 2006.  He said he could fix it, but wasn't allowed to; I am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail.  
 I have been told many times to believe people when they tell you about themselves. In Rachel Pollack's introduction, she reveals that Haindl approached her for this project because of her experience interpreting his art, not because of her knowledge of Kabbalistic principles. The rest of the book is simply her proving this thesis. I repect that Rachel Pollack has attempted to include a variety of different views on the Tree of Life. However, she consistently chooses to go with interpretations that favor the western Hermetic Tradition rather than traditional Rabbinic Kabbalism. The book uses the version of the Tree of Life invented by the fifteenth century Jesuit scholar Kircher rather than using the more traditional tree espoused a hundred years earlier by Rabbi Isaac Luria. This choice makes the rest of the book virtually useless to all but people who prefer Kircher's alteration of the tree. I really wanted to love this book. For people who favor the Western Hermetic Tradition over Kabbalah, it might be great. For me, it was just a disappointment. Perhaps calling it the Western Hermetic Tree would be a more honest title 
 All Covey is saying in his longwinded book, basically, is this: Listen to the people you love. Put the family first in all your decisions. Blah blah blah and something about synergy.  The writing is horrible, and the metaphors are overused. I also dislike Covey's plagiarizing material from the Bible and not acknowledging where he gets his "inspiration".  In one passage he equates the Bible and other books of scripture with "Chicken Soup For the Soul" as "wisdom literature".  Despite being a supposed devout Mormon himself, obviously he's afraid to mention the Book of Mormon in that passage. Perhaps he's afraid of scaring away potential pigeons--I mean, readers.   This was a book my book club decided to read; otherwise I'd have never even tried to get past the first few pages. I wonder how a man who is on the road more often than not can really interact with his own family and give "us", the poor ignorant masses, advice on our own families. In one passage he even says that other people's advice may not apply to our own situations. Then how can he expect us to take his advice?   Don't waste your money. If you absolutely must read it, get it from the library. Covey doesn't need your money, he has a huge house with a basketball court and indoor pool. He's doing fine. 
 Concept is good, songs are the funk and acid jazz you'd expect, but the cd sound quality is so poor it'll begin gathering dust immediately 
 I picked this book up because I saw the author interviewed on the Daily Show. Oops. I'm going to have to lower my trust in Jon Stewart a notch. One useful piece of advice I've received is not to be afraid to cut bait on a book that you don't really like. So after about 150 pages, I calling it quits with this one.  This book is supposed to recount the author's experience of growing up with a father in the CIA but it reads like a history lecture--and a dull one at that. I'm not sure why Richardson writes as though he's trying to distance himself from the narrative as much as possible. I'm not sure why anyone outside of his immediate family or friends would be interested in this book: the personal narrative lacks warmth and emotion and the anecdotes only hint at the gripping spy stories a lifetime of Tom Clancy has prepared me for 
 I think that this book carried on longer than it should. A good chuknk could've been cut out of this, and one sex scene was a little over the top and completely unrealistic. A lot of the scenes in this book seem to drag pointlessly on and on and on, like the descriptions for example. It would go from someone's hair, to their eyes, how the color of their eyes or hair contrasted with other colors. The it would go to another person's eyes and hair and how those contrasted with other colors. This book started off really well with the press conference, and finding out about the murders...but then the murders kinda get dropped for the rest of the book until the last chapter they get brought up again. I seriously think this book could've been written better. I almost considered not finishing it because the chapters carried on way too long. I did like, however how the different little things ths sithen did for Meredith helped with the story later as the book drug on and on 
 This book does a good job of telling you what your IPAQ can do but a very poor job of telling you how to do it.  I wanted more information about how to set up my IPAQ to connect with the internet.  The book told me it could be done and how wonderful it was, but lacked specific information about which screen to go to and how to actually make it work.    I later purchased IPAQ for Dummies.  This book told me what the IPAQ could do and specifically how to do it.  It was great.  The Dummies book also gave lots of information on programs that are very helpful to add to your IPAQ.    I was disappointed with IPAQ Pocket PC but very happy to get my hands on IPAQ for Dummies! 
 This will be short and sweet--I read this about three years ago....this book had potential but sucked.  Forget the fact that there is a graphic and brutal rape and murder of a kid, I can deal with that.    What I can't deal with is the fact that this girl goes to heaven, watches down on everyone she knew and basically the one last thing she does is inhabit the body of another girl and f*** the he** out of some guy she thinks is hot.  YEAH--tell me, on what effing planet is a CHILD raped and murdered and her one wish is to come back to earth for a few hours and do some guy?    Anyway, yeah, at that point the book became a huge chore for me to finish.  Lame to the extreme.  
 I wasn't impressed with these workouts. They are more like a gym class at school. I had never watched The BIggest Loser didn't realize how irritating  she was 
    I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE VERY FUNNY and it was in a very few instances.      Overall, I was disappointed and glad it was a short read 
 It is bad enough that this is a poor book with no balance, but to require it as a text in post-graduate studies in education almost brings on apoplexy.  It is a secular humanist apoligia for multiculturalism in education.  It is singular in point of view, never straying from the thesis that multiculturalism is good and schools must support it; hardly the sort of reference work for a university level discussion of the issues.  The philosophy behind the book is that people are hardly more or less than those cultural elements which have been socialized into them with little responsibility for their beliefs or actions.  The main text is that every culture is equally valuable in society, forgetting that "society" is essentially American culture with its own priorities.  They go into great detail on the virtues of immigrant cultures and the vices of the American culture, hardly accepting that it has a right to exist as well.  The most difficult aspect of this is the authors' almost laughable inability to get outside of their point of view and treat the issues with something approaching objectivity.  The book is unbearable in its "holier than thou" attitude.  I don't know if this is typical of the ilk but if so, it is hardly a wonder that the multicultural mavens have difficulty selling their point of vie 
 I mean, really.  SHARP OBJECTS has gotten tons of media coverage and nary a negative review in sight.  I usually read hundreds of novels a year, and I really don't get the big deal about this novel at all.  This book contains some sharply written prose, but the mystery plotline is quite weak.  SHARP OBJECTS is essentially a literary novel that the publisher has labeled a "mystery" to push more copies on unsuspecting consumers.  This slow-paced novel is not much of a whodunit and contains almost no suspense.  This novel does have a big plot twist near the end, but I found it to be implausable and pointless, tacked on for shock value and nothing more.    My major problem with this novel is the characters.  All of the major players in SHARP OBJECTS are cartoonishly nasty and dysfunctional.  Most of the characters are the residents of a small town in Missouri, and Gillian Flynn seems to have nothing but contempt for most of them.  The heroine of this book is an introspective bore, and possesses little personality beyond her self-destructive behavior.  I didn't like or identify with anyone in SHARP OBJECTS, which for me is a fatal problem with any novel.  I found this book tough to finish.   As Stephen King notes in his blurb, this is a nasty little novel.  The main question is whether you want to waste your time and money on something like this.  In the end, I regretted doing so.   
 As a disciple of Freud, Zweig was fascinated with the new psychoanalysis and applying it to historical characters. I think he overdoes it in his biography of Marie Antoinette, attributing her love of clothes, gambling, and partying to supressed desires rather than youthful vivacity, since she was a teenager, married at fourteen. This is a book that has outlived its time. Unfortunately, Zweig's Freudian interpretation has been imitated by other biographers and gives a false view of Marie Antoinette even to this day 
 This book was extremely difficult to understand. Full of big complicated terms that could have been said in simply easy to understand words.  If all my texts had been like this, I'd never have made it through school.  Not at all appropriate for undergrad work.  It's the only text I sold back, and was glad to get rid of it. A total waste of money. I had to buy another HBSE book just to figure out what this one was trying to say. 
 I found this book to be terse and unfriendly. I used this text for my introduction to markov chains class and did not get much out of it. If ur looking for a review of markov chain theory then U should consider this book. If ur looking for clear in-depth explanations and problems that are relevant to the chapters material look somewhere else 
 I might be in a slightly foul mood on account of my having just returned from a shopping experience which resulted in my receiving a parking ticket, but...  I used to watch KB's Hamlet on a fairly regular basis. Whether is was on cable or VHS, I found I could never get enough.  I signed the petition. I'm one of those people who's written letters in the hopes they'll actually make a difference.  That said, WHERE IS THE FRIKKIN' DVD? I mean, has anybody else noticed that KB's Hamlet has already missed the DVD boat? While the world is moving toward HD-DVD, we *still* have yet to see a sign of the stupid thing. I haven't owned a VCR since back before Amazon even really existed, or was, at least, widely known (I was an early adopter of DVD).  Now, years later - *years* after the first time I inquired about this release, I still can't believe it isn't out.  Reality check, people: Forbidden Planet, fine movie though it may have been (and in context of this discussion as, beneath its sci-fi exterior, one can find an interesting retelling of The Tempest), it's gone from film (decades before I was born) to VHS/Beta/?, to DVD, and now to HD-DVD.  Why is it that a film like Forbidden frikkin' Planet gets pushed up through the years and transferred over and over again to the latest medium when *the* finest version of Hamlet ever produced for the screen has been left behind?  What's going on? Is KB being held at gunpoint by Mel Gibson's handlers? Is there blackmail involved? Did KB contract George Lucas to add a bunch of CGI ewoks to each scene? 'Cause I can't figure out, for the life of me, why we haven't seen this stupid thing yet.  Was it that hard to commit it to VHS? It seems to me that it was readily and easily done.  So what's the deal with DVD? Is the money just not good enough, Mr. Branagh? I realize that your talents lie in theater rather than finances, but 100% of zero is zero.  It makes me wonder, then... is it some artistic issue? When transferred to the higher fidelity formats of DVD and HD-DVD, are there imperfections present that were undetectable when the film was out in VHS format?  Can we see more clearly how Charleton Heston's weird teeth have yellowed and browned over the years and formed into this strange rolling dental pattern greatly in need of modern dentistry (my dentist could set those teeth painlessly over a four month period without the use of orthodontics)?  For years, I've wondered about this. College came and went. I've moved to three different continents. My own career has gone from peon to Mr. Importantpants, and yet *we are still without even a DVD version of Hamlet*.  Yes, I realize there's a 4:3 version of the film available for digitital download, but please don't make me any more uppity than I already am.  I want the film, and I want it in its full glory, with proper aspect ratio, and preferably on HD-DVD so I can see it in all its glory (which would be especially nice considering the 70mm film used to record this sucker).  I hate to give what is easily the best film version of Hamlet ever produced (and, no, this point is not open to argument - it's not an opinion, but, rather, a scientifically proven fact) one star, but given that the man and his peeps have had over a *decade* to get the job done, I think it's really just about time to see it hitting store shelves.  If it *is* hitting shelves, by the by, I apologize for the rant, but I'm tired of waiting.  I want to see this movie on a disc before I die.  Widescreen.  Preferably HD.  I don't care about the bonus materials - you can keep 'em if *that's* what's taking so long.  But just get some dummy college intern to do the transfer and throw together a DVD menu.  If it can be done for Forbidden Planet, then it can be done for Hamlet.  I have spoken.  And I am awesome 
 I respect the message of "The Unexpected Legacy of Divorce" but it seems rather odd to call the ramifications of divorce "unexpected."  Those of us who have been through the hell of divorce know full well the problems our children face as a result.  Staying together for the children is one of the most damaging concepts of all times.  The author knows this and does present it in a way that eases my frustration a little bit. I know many people who have divorced and not one was due to not being ecstatically happy all the time.  They fell apart due to abuse, infidelity, and just plain incompatibility.  What I feel matters most for children is for them to feel loved and cared for by their parents.  When you have two parents who both love and share in the lives of the kids, most hardly notice whether or not they live in the same house. When you have a parent who refuses to makes the children a priority, who constantly disappoints, hurts, and replaces the kids, there will be damage, no getting away from it.  However, is it better for this type of parent to have daily access to the kids, seemingly with the other parent's approval?  I hardly think so and will challenge anyone who differs in opinion. It is impossible for any of the children of divorce to know if their lives would have been better had their parents stayed married.  This is  a major flaw in  the research.  I didn't see any statistics for custody or parental involvement which makes a huge difference. I don't think divorce is the answer for every marital problem but when it happens, you have a responsibility to make your children a priority and alleviate their fears.  When you put your own personal interests ahead of the kid's, whether it's divorce or starting a new life afterward, kids will suffer. I don't like 'studies' like this, they're misleading and potentially damaging. 
 Listening to the Standards being sung by Rod Stewart is like listening to Classical Music being played on a kazoo! If you're new to this music, try out some Sinatra CD's. He's the guy who sets the standard when it comes to singing the Standards 
 For those that are looking for something new and different to become inspired, this is not the choice. Just a bunch of inspiring sentences over and over again that seem redundant 
 What can you say about Buffy The Vampire Slayer that hasn't already been said? IMMORTAL is a typical Buffy story, with the typical cast of characters and the typical formula plot. Fun, but Shakespere is in no danger of being replaced. The biggest letdown of the audio version was, sadly, Charisma Carpenter, or Cordelia to her fans. The lady is an adequate actor, but her reading skills need a LOT of work! This could have been a more enjoyable program with a better narrator. Sorry, Cordy 
 The subject matter of this book is something that is of tremendous use in an elementary classroom. However, the text is choppy, and the subject hard to follow from one idea to the next.  Even the illustrations fail to  provide a common thread woven throughout the book.  The collage style  pictures are beautiful to look at, but confusing to tie together,  especially when paired with the choppy text 
 I bought the CD because I watched David Gilmour on AOL's Sessions Archive and they played Comfortably Numb. I love that song.  This CD is a disappointment.  Even Comfortably Numb sounds better sung by David and his band then it did back in 1979.    Save your money.  This is just more of Roger Water's ranting and raving.  He, for some reason, wanted to be a looney and that certainly comes across.  I hope David and his present band make and album with old Pink Floyd favorites.  They are so much better now, both vocally and accoustcally 
 I agree with the reviews that consider this book a pretentious, self-indulgent, ego-fest. Wallace is obviously highly intelligent, and every minute of this book seems designed to remind us of that.   It all starts off well enough. The characters are quirky and interesting. At first. And Wallace does a good enough job of setting up a curious chain of events to keep the reader reading and wondering what's going to happen. But nothing ever really happens. And at some point I just grew sick of the characters and their weird little lives.   Ultimately, this just felt like what happens when a really smart person decides to write something as a way to experiment with and exhibit his own intellect. And while that exercise may have been rewarding for Wallace, it wasn't so terribly rewarding for the reader.  
 I really didn't read it as it is too long and does not keep my interest at all.  I have read other books in the past like "Body for Life" and found them very informative and short and to the point.  
 This book will do very little to help you understand the Brussels Griffon. There are only a few pages about Griffs. The rest is about any kind of dog, and Griffs are not like other dogs. They have many unusual traits. Save your money and buy a book that is really about Griffs. The only one I know of is Doone Raynham's 
 Self indulgent, purile, child-like, pure unadulterated garbage of the highest order.  A truly horrible movie.  
 I read Pest Control and absolutly loved it - it is the type of book you can denfinately see being made into a movie.  However, I found The Organ Grinders very difficult to read.  Much as I appreciate how Fitzhugh is trying to make us see some of the ills of the modern world (very commendable!) but I just found it heavy going.  In fact I'm only three quarters of the way through and it's taken four weeks to read this far (I normally finish a book within a week).  I could quite happily put the book on the shelf and forget about it; the only thing keeping me reading it is the fact I don't want to waste the time I've already invested. Sorry if I sound scathing, Just disappointed, Pest Control is brill, Maybe I should shelf The organ Grinders and read that again 
 This book is a style guide, with guidance like, "When introducing small sections that contain subsections, use itemized lists rather than sentences"; "Begin optional steps with a clear visual and verbal indication that they are not mandatory"; and "When listing commands, follow the capitalization rules on which your product is based." The beginning and end of the book provide a shallow discussion of single sourcing, but much of the book is style guidance like this. Maybe I'm missing something, but what does that have to do with single sourcing? I sure don't understand these 5-star reviews and encourage you to flip through the pages of this book before buying so you know what you're getting 
 The book starts by proclaiming that neo-classical economics is adequate for explaining the information economy. This claim is not backed up in the book. First, textbook neo-clasical equilibrium theory contains neither money nor 'information'. Second, the book merely discusses qualitatively and nonsystematically ideas like positive feedback and increasing returns that were better presented by Brian Arthur. Third, even asymmetric information is not discussed (Ackerlof and Stiglitz are not even mentioned). Fourth (or zeroth), there is not a single empirical graph in the entire book, and nothing of modern ideas of network theory. So I would say that the book is more or less on the same level as Kelly's (pre-bubble-bust) "New Rules for the New Economy". All of these books implicitly hype the unregulated free market, in the face of both qualitative and empirical evidence that unregulated markets are not only unstable but are detrimental to human health and well-being 
 I found this DVD ery unhelpful, I bought for the merengue portion, and I feel like I threw my money away, It's a good enough video if you are new to salsa and merengue, but I don't recommend it for someone with experienc 
 I realize that HARDCASE is supposed to be a tribute to the hardboiled noir novels of times past.  Still, I don't think that's an excuse for the book's remarkably one-dimensional level of characterization.     Most of the major players in this rather slim novel are cartoonish, unbelievable stereotypes.  It doesn't help that the main character, Joe Kurtz, is an unlikable anti-hero whose only goal in this book is to make money for himself.  Most of the villains are appallingly stupid and pose no real threat to Kurtz.  There is therefore no one to root for in this novel and very little real suspense.  HARDCASE is readable and fast-paced, but its convulted mafia plot is ultimately kind of silly.  This is ultimately a tongue-in-cheek type of a book with a lot of twists and double-crosses.  If you're looking for realistic situations and characters, you won't find them here.    I read a lot of thrillers and crime fiction, and I think you could do much better than HARDCASE.  My advice is to skip this novel and read novels by PI writers like Robert Parker, Richard Stark, Bill Prozini, Max Alan Collins, and Lawrence Block, who do far superior work in the noir subgenre 
 OK, I had heard "Annapolis" was a pale imitation of "An Officer and a Gentleman"--but I still went into it with an open mind.  Just because a film shares similar plot points or qualities with another film doesn't mean it isn't worthy of a look.  There are only so many plots to go around--take romantic comedies, for example.  If you got rid of those that copied other movies, we'd be left with about six total in the history of cinema.  If something is done well, it can defy its limitations and seem fresh.  Heck, it isn't even as if "An Officer and a Gentleman" was a novel or new story--it played by fairly conventional storytelling rules, it just did so exceedingly well.  So, trying as hard as possible to offer a different perspective--I, too, feel that "Annapolis" borrows heavily from "Officer."  It's all here.  Boy from wrong side of the tracks makes good in the service--check.  Cadet who can't complete obstacle course helped by hero--check.  Cadet who doesn't succeed attempts suicide--check.  Hero's tension with superior leads up to big fight--check.  Mutual respect, triumph over adversity--check, check, CHECK already.  By jettisoning the romance at the heart of "Officer," "Annapolis" is left with only the cliche'--becoming a good person through military service.   But even that pales in comparison.  James Franco is a good actor, but he is becoming increasingly expressionless.  It's as if he thinks a dour expression equals seriousness.  Richard Gere (in "Officer"), meanwhile, ran a real emotional gamut--rage, passion, heartbreak.  He made a very typical story moving and powerful.  But, of course, he had Louis Gossett, in an Oscar winning performance, to play off of.  Let's just say that Tyrese Gibson isn't in that league.  As the female lead, we've got Jordana Brewster.  She is appealing and likable, if not particularly believable in this role.  One of my main issues with "Annapolis" is its sloppy character development.  Franco is regarded as the worst cadet in the unit, and as such is really ridden by his superiors.  He is a loner, doesn't ask for help--so you know a valuable life lesson will need to be learned.  Gere, in "Officer," was just such a recruit.  But the moment he is broken, the moment of his realization--it is a brilliant and emotionally devastating scene played to perfection.  In "Annapolis," though, blink and you'll miss it--there's no catharsis here.  One night he just decides to be a great recruit.  He then studies all night to improve his scores, trains for boxing all day and night for a big tournament, and helps his roommate on the obstacle course all day.  I don't know when he sleeps or does any real "soldiering."     "Annapolis" is, essentially at heart, a chaste and glossy remake.  But lacking the dynamic performances and the realness, it just falls short as entertainment.  No deeper than a typical music video, it's all surface--pretty to look at, but ultimately forgettable.

 I have Jennifer's Crunch Salsa Dancing DVD, and it was my first dance exercise DVD.  I loved it so much I've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor.  I find the moves too difficult and frustrating.  By the time you are close to having one step down, she's moving onto the next one, and it doesn't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that I enjoy in her Crunch video.  In that one she started out slow, repepated it several times, then did it real time, and then added another combination the same way.  The end result was putting the two combinations together, so basically repeating four moves over and over, doing about six dance routines all together, which was good enough for me.  When I do it now, I just go right to real time and ignore the slow start, so I haven't been bored at all.  She looks great in this video, but I agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all.  Basically I ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles.  But if I was a good dancer, this would probably be a lot of fun.     
 Now I'd actually give this movie 3.5 stars. But since so many people talk about being one of the greatest movies ever made I'm giving it a 1. The story was quite good in how it dealt with the American Dream and how a dysfunctional a family can be behind a seemingly perfect house. Kevin Spacey gave an excellent comedic performance as Lester Burnham, the one with the midlife crisis. Annette Benning's character Carolyne is Lester's obsessive-compulsive perfectionist wife who's role tells us the consequences of giving more importance to material things over family. But there were parts in the film which didn't make much sense. What's with Janie showing her breasts through the window at Ricky? How come Ricky stood naked in front of her during a conversation? There was no need for that. A girl her age especially would freak if a guy stood naked in front of her like that. But she seemed perfectly fine with it. Also Ricky's point about the plastic bag he filmed having beauty in how it freely danced in the wind is just another pathetic attempt at being artistic. This is apparently just another arthouse film that critics praise, making it seem better than it really is. Frankly it was also very dull and depressing. 
 this is not a good book to find a hawaiian name for your child. i have a better and older one that was only $1.50 and it has been much more helpful. i wouldnt but this one if you are looking to find a name and learn how to pronounce it 
 I do NOT recommend that you buy this book. Dr. Taylor is very good at promoting herself and appearing on television, but I do not believe that she is better than any other dermatologist at treating the skin of people of color. She is more style than substance, I suggest that you SAVE YOUR MONEY and check this book out of the library if you have the time to read it but don't spend any money on this 
 How could Rhino do it? The most electrifying bass intro of the 60s is left off the beginning of Tighten Up, one of THE funkiest songs of all time. No opening bass line! Not only that, but the linear notes disses Archie and  the Drells' early albums, loading up on their mid-seventies disco crud.  True, the album has the three big ones - Tighten Up, I Can't Stop Dancin'  and Gonna Be a Showdown. But Tighten Up is the only song from their first  album included on this CD. No I Don't Wanna be a Playboy, A Soldier's  Prayer, Give Me Time, or any of the others. Whoever put this compilation  together for Rhino is NOT an Archie Bell and the Drells fan. The minute I  put the CD on and heard Tighten Up start with the drum roll and not the  bass line, I knew I would be disappointed. Let's hope someday Rhino comes  to its senses and releases whole albums of Archie Bell and the Drells, not  this pathetic compilation 
 While this is very well written novel, the story is woefully below par.  Ms. Flieger has the imagery, wonder, and heart of the fantsy novel down, yet her story - a transformation 'myth' akin to those found in Celtic mythology - is painful to read.    While atrocities happen left and right to the main character 'Mokie' (the name itself made me roll my eyes) that was not the painful part of this book.  The pacing is inconsistant, characters were stock 'types' recycled in thousands of books, and the "SURPRISE" ending was very clear about 1/3 of the way through the book.  All in all it felt as though Ms. Flieger (who is a Professor of modern fantasy, medieval literature, and mythology) felt since she has the tools (all of that knowledge to draw from) that she could write a great book.  And I agree, she is very good at the mechanics of writing - in fact an above par "wordsmith" - but her storytelling is not good.  A dreadful, typical, and almost trite fantasy tale cannot be saved by the technical ability of this author.  I CANNOT reccomend this book to anyone looking for an enjoyable read, but if you are looking for a well crafted book that bears all the hallmarks of good technical writing, then this is for you.     
 Who buys and listens to his stuff?!  I got this CD as a gift and must say I was very disappointed to hear that this is what America likes?  His voice sounds so average "broadway musical" and not outstanding at all. My bet is he can thank American Idol that he sells any albums at all. 
 James Gaffney, the editor of this volume of three Newman works, has got to be kidding. Just look at the back cover via the "Search Inside" feature. Portraying Newman as the champion of the use of one's conscience as the sole guide to one's moral decisions is laughable, especially considering how easily the conscience can be malformed (such as through immoral indoctrination). Even worse, Gaffney portrays Newman as promoting the idea that the Church's views on faith and morals must change with each era's "new ways of understanding." On the contray, Newman is the champion of the Catholic Church's notion of the development of doctrine which includes the belief that matters of faith and morals dogmatically defined (i.e. declared as binding on the faith of the people) are preserved from error. While the Church has developed its doctrines (such as with the Virgin Mary, indulgences, and purgatory), these doctrines are believed to be fully in-line with the original deposit of faith given to the apostles, principally Peter via "the keys," by Jesus Christ. Gaffney doesn't stop there. Even worse, he portrays Newman as promoting the idea that the laity "are the source and final seal of the church's teaching; thus the Bishops must listen to them." On the contary, Newman viewed the laity as important for the development of doctrine, especially with the Marian doctrines, but he did not view them as the ultimate ratifiers of doctrine...such would be wholly contrary to his argument in An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine. It should also be considered that Newman's views on both the laity and the papacy developed over the years. For instance, originally he opposed the First Vatican Council's plans to dogmatically define "papal infallibility" and for various reasons such as how it would be worded (see Avery Dulles' article in Theological Studies journal), but he ultimately agreed with the decision and promoted it.  I am amiss as to how Gaffney received a teaching position at Loyola University in New Orleans? He clearly has an agenda to promote, and in so doing he alters the thought of Newman. One should consult legitimate Newman scholars like Ian Ker (a Roman Catholic), Owen Chadwick (an Anglican), and Jaroslav Pelikan (an Eastern Orthodox Christian).  An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine is probably the most important work in Catholic theology since St. Thomas' Summa Theologica. But get the University of Notre Dame Press edition, also found on Amazon.com.  Sola Dei Gloria 
 This is not a satire of Candide, it's not a slice of pop culture. It's a dirty old man's idea of what sex should be like. A dirty old virgin man.   It's boring. The writing is atrocious. It has several rapes and incest scenes in it. It has no more than one instance of a woman enjoying sex (and I can't be sure about that one) with sex on nearly every page. It is racist and sexist and boring. If you want 80 variations on what to call a woman's sexual organs, this is the book for you (honey pot, lamb-pit, sugar scoop, ever-sweeting, etc). If you want a book indicitive of the culture of the time, or just plain full of sex, please look elsewhere 
 I read this book as part of a Contemporary World Literature course I took in college, and I thought it was the worst book I have ever read.  The book is supposed to be about a white woman in South Africa whose father is in prison because of his anti-apartheid views.  The strange thing is I learned NOTHING about South Africa, living conditions for whites and blacks in South Africa, and the effect that apartheid had on people in living in South Africa.  This book was written in a hoity-toity, avant garde, stream of conciousness fashion that it was impossible to know what was going on.  I found myself counting the number of pages until I finished the book.  The author of this book should seriously consider writing a book that is coherent, informs people, and broadens their horizon of knowledge, which this book certainly does NOT do 
 I really had a problem with this book.  This is my first encounter with Feist's work, and I'm finding it difficult to give him a second chance.  From reading other reviews, it seems that people who have read previous works by Feist derive some enjoyment from the world this book is written in, as well as the presence of some familiar characters.  Since I lacked this prior knowledge about Midkemia and its inhabitants, I was left to judge the book purely for the quality of the fiction, and I found it to be uninspiring.    Talon is an incredibly shallow character.  His thoughts and actions are polarized and always single faceted.  If at any time during a book you can describe the complete emotional state of the main character in one word, the author is probably doing something wrong.  While this is bad, it is not disastrous; except when you consider that Feist conveys Talon's emotions to us in a totally uninteresting way.  I believe the addage is, "show, don't tell."  It didn't seem like any of Talon's emotions were real because they were conveyed in such a mind-numbing manner.  It seemed to me that Talon was forced along by the plot rather than guided by his emotions.  Furthermore, Talon's transformation from mountain boy to noble swordsman extraordinaire was unbelievable to the point of being ridiculous.  How Feist can expect us to swallow this garbage while he skips over years of Talon's training and culturing is truly remarkable.  I do not have a problem with Feist's plot idea of turning a country bumpkin into a hero (it is a hallmark fantasy plot), but you have to make the reader believe it.  A few chapters of magic school, snippets of verbal training, and a few sword bouts are not enough to raise this character to the level that Feist has raised him.    Other characters in this book were similarly shallow.  I really saw no difference between any of Talon's trainers except their professions.  You could literally exchange the dialogue between Caleb and Robert, or Caleb and Magnus, or any other similar pair, and you would not notice the difference.  They all spoke exactly the same way, and taught similar lessons.  The battle sequences were dull, ambiguous, and failed to excite me.  The language Feist used was simple and boring more often than not.  Do yourself a favor and read George R.R. Martin's or Terry Goodkind's series instead of this one.    
 My wife and I are just back from three weeks in Venice. We brought this book along, hoping that it would be as useful as Emily Wise Miller's wonderful "The Food Lover's Guide to Florence." It was not. We found the quality of the recommendations to be quite spotty: some excellent, some definitely not. We found the "variety" of cuisines recommended to be a little over the top (TexMex and margaritas in Venice?). Worst, by the end of our stay we found that only one of our half dozen or so favorite restaurants was in "Chow, Venice!": the selection here is not very reliable.  We had much more success with Michela Scibilia's "A Guide to the Eateries of Venice". Michela is that rarest of persons: a native Venetian between the ages of 25 and 60. She wrote the first edition of this book in 1992 (in Italian), as a way of guiding friends from elsewhere in Italy away from the tourist traps and towards her favorite places to eat. The book has been updated with a third edition and an English translation in the last few years. While it's not available through Amazon (fix that, you guys! ;) ), it's available in many bookstores in Venice, including those at the Doge's Palace and the Correr Museum in San Marco Square.  "Chow, Venice!" is not without merit as a secondary resource. We used its food glossary quite often. It recommends a few more "Inexpensive" restaurants than "The Eateries of Venice" (though we found buying a smaller meal at a more expensive place was a more interesting way of going "Inexpensive"). If you like great food, though, you'll definitely want to buy a copy of the Scibilia guide, even if you're only going to be in town a few days. 
 One-Eyed Cat is about a kid named Ned Wallis who shoots a cat with an air-rifle and eventually confesses.  This book is another novel centered around the main character's guilt for doing a wrong. I found it to be very dull and distasteful, as I have already had my own real-life struggles with similar topics. I didn't relate well to the characters, either.  I wouldn't recommend reading this book. I think it is boring and that there are better books to read 
 As a first timer to accounting I htought the book should have better explained the basics instead of rushing into so much complicated material. I feel in order to be able to understand this book I should have taken a basic accounting class first 
 I bought this for my mountain bike with large suspension forks.  I tried the instructions to find the proper placement of the sensor but that was useless as it just has a picture for this part.  No recommendations for proper location.  Then I found the only way the system would register a rotation is to have the magnet touch the sensor.  So now I have an annoying clicking and am wondering when it will actualy break from the constant contact.  Going to send it bac 
 This through the glass unit performed well enough for my needs as I am only looking for local traffic tie-up information of close-by autos....the problem is that it will not stay on the windshield....I am on my third unit in an attempt to get it to stay on permanently instead of a few weeks....the first one was put on by professional installers of all my 3rd party electronics ... have dealt with them for years as they do excellent work...it fell off and was lost after about 10 days....the second one I put on myself...and followed the directions to an exact degree....including the heating of the glue with a hair dryer for 4 minutes....cleaning the windshield as directed etc etc....using silicon to seal the unit further...this one stayed on for more than a month and then fell off and was lost....the third one was supplied to me directly by Midland at no charge, much to their credit....I havent tried putting on the third one yet because of the weather...I have my fingers crossed....would I buy this again....definitely not.....probably no through the glass units from anyone else either.............. 
 My all time favorite book is Deavers THE BLUE NOWHERE and The Testament by another author.  I think this book is on the bottom of my list.  It was a combo term paper and novel.  I wonder where the editor of this book is.  Where was he/she?  It read like it was written by two different people and a poor editor combined them.    Don't worry Jeff, I'll still buy your next book...I've bought them all but please ...get a second opinion about your editor. I good editor wouldn't have let it go out in this shape. 
 If you start running just now and want to run a marathon this is a good book for you. If you already have some running years of experience, and perhaps already ran a marathon, it won't help you. What is written is very basic, very well known to anyone who has already ran for a short time. I wanted help on "how to train for and run my best marathon", I didn't get it from this book 
 This book is a standard one for graduate-level algebra courses.  I practically wore mine out over a year-long course, and came to know it intimately.  Dummit and Foote is a book that teaches via wordy explanations and lots of examples.  Of course, examples are very important.  However, the explanations are often muddled and not clear (e.g. see tensor products).  They frequently relegate important theorems or definitions to the exercises, and the organization is poor.  Consequently, it can be very hard to find things later when you might need them.  Also, the bindings on this book frequently fail.  My book fell apart very quickly, and I know other students who had the same problem.  I recommend Rotman's Advanced Modern Algebra instead of Dummit and Foote. 
 This book is basically Marxist view of art, and what art is intended to accomplish.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing!  It does help you to examine your assumptions and beliefs a bit, and that's one of the things an education is supposed to do.  The book repeatedly hammers the idea that art serves the purposes of the ruling class.  This is beat upon to the point of tediousness.  There is also a chapter that can be summarized as "art serves the purposes of powerful men by trivializing women and encouraging them to think of themselves as an object d'art for the viewing pleasure of others.  Oddly enough, the book didn't really return to this them in the final essay when it talked about the visual image in advertising.  That's an arena where visual imagery is used to play on the insecurities of everyone, but especially women, to convince them that they are flawed and need __(fill in the name of a product)____ to be happy and respected and glamorous. Speaking of which, one of the more interesting points in the book (even though I believe it is flat wrong) is the discussion of the rise of "glamor" as a desirable trait.  I found the book interesting, and it irritated me, but only in a good way--By making me think about my views.  But it really is written from the perspectives of a trendy liberal from the early 1970s.  Instead of closing with a powerful message summarizing some important aspect of art that we have been taught, the authors even use the final paragraph of the last essay to point out that capitalism exploits the masses and coerces them to ignore their own best interest(that's literally what it says!).  Probably worth reading, but not a high priority.  The Penguin edition is compact and affordable, but the B&W images are so small that much of the value of the work is lost--You can't see details of the art being reproduced 
 Lipstick Jungle was not a great read.  It started off with interesting characters, but the women ended up being superficical and inconsistent.  The part that I hated the most was that Candance Bushnell developed difficult circumstances for her characters, and than appeared to get tired of the story, and just resolved all the problems.  I mean she went from one chapter where everything was terrible to the next chapter where everything was "just peachy! 
 Mr. Galbraith is smart, accomplished, and learned man who knows what is best for all us.  His view of a good society differs from past visions of societal utopia.  Rather than a completely coercive state directing the  actions of its citizens to some hirer calling, Mr. Galbraith aims to be  `practical' and just further defines the third way.  Nonetheless, his  proposal of what makes a good society is not the classical liberal view and  it is more attuned to the European model of society.  Many of his proposals  are so silly you won't take them seriously.  But sadly, he is quite  serious.  For example, Mr. Galbraith states that in a good society everyone  should have a rewarding life.  Of course, he never defines the standard by  which society should judge whether or not a life is rewarding.  Neither  does he address what one should do if their life is un-rewarding and what  the obligation is of society to fulfill that vision of a rewarding life.   And, of course, who is the `rewarding life judge' and does this judge have  the authority of the state to take something from someone (who has a life  that is deemed too rewarding) for someone who has life that is too  un-rewarding.  Mr. Galbraith fails to convince the reader of the  practicality of his proposals and ends up straddling a line between  socialism and capitalism, and saying nothing new 
 Israel is too small for Shimon Peres.  As a young man, he assiduously read the works of Leon Trotsky, as he says in his memoirs.  Trotksy's distorted Marxist view of reality has stayed with Peres his entire career.  Trotsky was only interested in "world revolution", making everybody the same, and Trotsky would define what the "same" would be and use force to impose it. Thus Peres reveres the song of John Lennon "Imagine" in which talks about a world without nations or religions, and I presume Peres and Lennon would then force all of us to believe in what they believe in also, even if we don't want to.  Peres retains the Marxist philosophy that man's primary motivation is economics  which leads him to make his silly statement in his book "The New Middle East"-"in the modern world all people care about is money and internet"-although we see that the Muslim extremists and their supporters don't seem to think the way Peres does.  In any event, there is no place for the Jews or Zionism in his scheme of things.  When Peres and Rabin made their Nobel Prize speeches, they made them in English, although the custom for everyone else who shows pride in their country and culture is to make it in their native language, as did their "friend and partner" Arafat.  Obviously Judaism, the Hebrew language and Zionism are embarrassments to him.  Fortunately, the people of Israel have had their say by reducing the number of seats the party he has had a stranglehold over for almost the last 30 years from 44 down to 19.    Thus, the reader interested  in seeing the way Israel is going in the future had better look elsewhere than this cliche-filled, "politically correct" book.  
 I thought that this album wasnt one of Keith's best albums...I like some of the older albums better but maybe we will see more of the "better" albums in the future 
 I could not sit through this movie. The acting and screenplay are terrible. This film could be described as a bad made-for-tv movie at best.   I ended up fast-forwarding though the entire movie after the first 30 minutes and turned the player off before I reached the end. I couldn't take it anymore. This movie is one of the worst I've attempted to watch in a long time.    Not recommended.  
 Sorry this just aint Hoodoo. This guy took all sorts of fluffy new age nonsense and made a book. I understand he wrote two others, Im afraid to even look at em. The book is useless, useless that is unless you want to be confused and made a fool of. No, if you wanna read hoodoo check out the very well written book by Cat Yronwode, thats hoodoo!! 
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 Having personally had the privilege to study with three of the Underground Railroad's top historians: David Blight, James Horton, and Lois Horton; All three said that there is not a shred of evidence supporting the idea that quilts served as maps.  Quilts were however sewn and sold as fundraisers for abolitionist groups.  
 I expected to love the book.  I love horse racing.  I ride horses.  I'm not troubled by slow, dense, books.  So I'm very disappointed to find that this book did not engage me, and I have to throw in the towel and put it back in the stack.  I've read quite a few horse books including Horse People: Scenes from the Riding Life, but Michael Korda, and some by Rita Mae Brown - the Virginia Fox hunting series, and of course, Seabiscuit.  This is a character driven, rather than a plot driven book.  Nevertheless, I didn't find that I enjoyed any of the characters, particularly Al and Rosalind - whose marriage did not float my boat.  As I forced my way deeper and deeper into it, I found myself saying - I don't Care about these People!  The setting didn't grab me.  I didn't feel the 'feel' of the racetrack, the feel of the saddle under my seat, the smell of leather, the rumble of distant hoofbeats.  Even the environment of the working class/hired people didn't provide a compelling 'atmosphere' for the story.  I did like that the horses and animals were given page time.  The animals were more enjoyable than the people.  I'm sure its just me.  Maybe if I wait a year then I'll pick up the book in the right mood to have it take hold of me.  But for now, I can't read it, and I'm passing my thoughts along in case there is any body else out there like me 
 I didn't find this reference any good UNTIL I knew vi well. It is OK for a quick look up to remember a command; but to learn something new or more than you already know forget it. I have a coffee mug with vi commands on it that is far more helpful. Because of this experience, I am reluctant to buy others in this series (e.g. Python Pocket Reference) 
 This book reads more like a dream of what India could be rather than an objective assessment of what it is. It is proof that Indians continue to suffer from a serious inferiority complex with the constant need to assert their "greatness" without down-to-earth critical assessment of reality facing the country. 
 The subtitle of the book is "A Christian Minister's Defense...." So how can a man with a doctorate in theology have such a poor understanding of Scripture?  If you're a conservative, Bible-believing Christian looking for a conservative biblical approach to the Harry Potter/Christianity issue, this book will surely disappoint you. The author takes a very dim view of Scripture.   I found John Granger's book to be much better written and far more informative 
 This book is comparable to the dozens of others written by extremists on both ends of the political spectrum.  Do these guys really think America is this stupid 
 Some thoughts on "A Carnivore's Inquiry:"  A narrator can be both sympathetic and unsympathetic provided that they are interesting to read about. Katherine's closest relative, Hannibal Lecter, knew more about wine, food and culture than we did, and we envied him for it.  Katherine Shea knows very little about anything other than what brands surround her, and her ambivalence towards horrific events is merely adolescent rather than indicative of humanity.  Murray's exquisite skill at painting a scene is akin to eating nothing but Creme Brulee. Inside the twelve course meal that is the novel, one craves a greater variety of ingredients. I am sure her short stories are marvels.  Her characters are not convincing actors; their motivations for action are suspect when they are present, which is not often. We are asked to believe that our distant, dilettante narrator inspires lust and love in every man she meets.  This is implied and not convincingly rendered.  The historical recreations fail to reflect, augment or amplify the novel's main theme: man's hunger for literal or spiritual wealth (laid down in a paragraph on page 286).  Thought was given to their rendering, but not to their overall thematic importance.  We cannot believe in her resourcefulness as a character because chance plays too large a role in her life.  For a gourmand, she is surprisingly chaste about describing sex or her carnivorous meals.  Murray's talents would have been put to great use here. 
 I don't mind athat the album is soft I just mind that it's not very good. Zakk isn't the best guy to be singing slower songs anyways, great guitarist but a crappy voice. I love other albums from BLS but this one was extremely disappointing. Crazy or High is one of their best songs ever and there's a few other decent ones but overall very boring album. 
 As much as I would like to recommend this movie, I have to admit it is not one of the best movies of Jesus life. It does follow the text of Matthew's gospel essentially word for word, which is, at times, a useful tool.  That said, the acting is mediocre. Bruce Marchiano as Jesus is a flop. He just doesn't pull it off convincingly. I often teach a class where I show people clips from different Jesus movies. Marchiano's poor acting often evokes laughter in the group.  If you what the best Jesus movie ever done, nothing beats Zeffirelli's TV mini-series Jesus of Nazareth.  The two other parts to this series, Acts and John, are done very well. 
 It's very nice to go back to those exciting years with this DVD, but they could have done a better job with the image digitalization. There is much better image quality bootleg DVD's out there with virtually the same content. I think fans deserve the best for the money they spend and unfortunately, this is not the case. 
 Rev. Dyson  dissects the great black man of the last century and attempts to get some insight into how his image translates to modern America. I found the chapter concerning Dr. King's embrace of democratic socialism to be enlightening, but I found the Rev. Dyson handing out alibis for King's adultery disappointing. Equally mind blowing is Dyson's using overblown language to assail the King family's efforts to control their loved one's image. I wonder why there are hard feelings, since Dexter and Coretta King talked to him for this book. This is an interesting character study that does draw some modern parallels, but would have been better if it were about 3 chapters shorter 
 I had this one in high school.  I remember loving it.  After purchasing it, I realized it wasn't as good as I remembered it being.  Granted, it has brought back quite a few memories, but I don't really know if they're really worth remembering.  It's up to you, buy it if you want 
 I love the book Christy and though I think it's usually hard for a tv or movie version of a book to totally live up to it's namesake, the first series did this job pretty well I think.  This version, however, was overacted (Other than Dr. McNeil's character which I still think was acted pretty well),and the characters didn't have the heart and spirit that they did in the book.  The overacting and poorly done camera work make what is a great story seem hokey and dumbed down.  Also many of the characters aren't very well cast either.  I don't recommend this version at all but still recommend the book and the other television version of this story 
 an astonishingly bad book. i'm amazed a respectable university press would put something like this out. incredibly breezy, sloppy writing, many typos, little theoretical sophistication...just atrocious 
 I love technical material from an expert source.  But the writer has to be able to graphically communicate the information and show knowledge of more than just the topic of material.    For example, Carl Sagan (I miss him terribly) wrote some of the world's best books, arguing the real world against silly, false beliefs of deities, ghosts, and aliens. There are others too - including:  Shermer who have followed this style.   However, Sagan had such an amazing intelligence of such varied topics that he could have been an expert in just about anything: geology, religion, history, energy, military protocol - just to name a few.  Thus, his writing spoke to the lay reader.  Sagan shared his superior knowledge by teaching things that made a difference.  So, when he landed upon the specific topic of his books, he had the reader educated, impressed, and thoughtful of reality.   Shermer is missing the mark with his works.  He simply doesn't pull the reader in enough to solidify his full basis of discussion and arguments.  He knows his topic but drives it home, technically, so often that all other factors of thoughtful prose and emotion are unavailable to the reader. Therefore, the works end up like a textbook for an adult education, community center, philosophy class.   I bought this book after browsing the bookstore shelves searching for something to awaken my critical thought processes.  A few times each year, I attempt to purchase such topics as WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS for the sake of educating myself further in the aspect of religious phooey.   While browsing, I read the cover, added a couple pages from the middle, and settled on the first chapter.   I was sold - primarily by the title.  My scans of the pages inside didn't really lock me into the purchase but I enjoyed the possibilities of the title and the subsequent chapter titles.  Thus, I bought it.  I was terrible excited about the read.  I wanted it to be good, if not great!  I gave the book several reads, intense sessions of focus and intrigue. Unfortunately, all of my attempts led to the same conclusion.  Shermer bored me.  I found myself drifting in thought.  Sure, I landed on a few interesting points but like a flash of light, as soon as I read further, hoping for something worthy of my time, I found nothing but drifting prologue discussion.  Boring!  It appears that Shermer is  indeed knowledgeable of the battle between belief and non-belief.  He has completed his research and does share it with the reader.  However, Shermer dictates the material to a point of it reading more like a manual than an intriguing work.    WHY PEOPLE BELEIVE WEIRD THINGS is written by a man who seems to be writing what Ticky-Tacky suburbanites want to read.  His work is flashy in titles and starts out with a credible amount of teasing validation but soon wanders off into a (let's show the world how much I know about this) non thought provoking work.    Unfortunately, I was desperately disappointed in this book and though I certainly tried it several times, I ended up failing to connect with it.  Recently, I fell upon another bounce of bad, literary luck. While again browsing for a new read, I landed upon the book WHY DARWIN MATTERS. Excellent title, and the chapters were interesting.  I flipped through and thought "Maybe there's something here."  I bought it.    Upon returning home and breaking the book open, I found myself locked into the first chapter.  Then, I suddenly found the material becoming uneventful and simply to mushy, with repetitive information that can be found in so many other sources.    Immediately I started to make a connection between how this book seemed so similar in style to WHY PEOPLE BELIEVE WEIRD THINGS.  I dug up the copy and sure enough...both are written by Shermer.  Needless to say, I didn't finish that book either.  No more Shermer for me.    
 I loved Mortal Kombat,and I thought the sequel would carry on the great Kombat legacy.I was heartily dissapointed when I saw annihilation.Brian Johnson was cool as Khan,but some of the special effects were so fake I had to laugh.Robin Shou returns as Liu Kang,the savior of Earth.After killing Shang Tsung,the group heads on home when all of a sudden,the Emperor busts up the party and sends his minions down.There,Khan makes his first appearance,along with his abnormal,yet awesome soldiers.Johnny Cage is killed,and Rayden(now played by James Remar)fights Khan,winning but sacrificing Johnny Cage.Now,Earth has seven days before it's destroyed.What I didn't like about this movie was appearances by people who had died in the first film,like Scorpion and Sub-zero.Who heard of Sub-Zero having a brother.Another thing that got me was how Liu Kang's fighting got worse since the first film.He was losing every battle,except the end,and even then he wasl osing.Do not get this film if you want to avoid dissapointment 
 My husband and I are both James Coburn fans but we found this movie to be unwatchable.  The story line is boring in that you just keep seeing him getting called in the middle of the night and then leaving the President's room.  We watched this once and will not waste the time on watching it again 
 In a society that tends to believe in creationism, Wells continues the politically correct campaign to change minds through public appeal instead of research.  Science is a slow process that requires evidence presented to academic peers for the process of a slow paradigm shift to occur.  Since ID has no evidence other than a longing from the dominant political group in the US, it is nothing more than faith.    Wells does a good job of citing numerous scientists, admitting that they are evolutionists, yet finding their disagreements with evolution.  He uses the process and characteristics of science (peer reviews and tentative conclusions) to challenge the general tenet that evolution is the fundamental process of biology.  Wells would like to win the media battle, but that has already been decided, and ID/creationism wins.  However, science is not democratic.  Evidence is required and supernatural processes do not provide the necessary information.  Wells, and other supporters of supernatural processes, will continue to get support from the general public until science education recieves proper support.  
 This book was recommended for me to read by my husband's personal therapist.  He's in anger counseling, after coming back from Iraq, and I'm the one reading about six books right now.  While it was worth the read, I need MORE:  More instruction, more direction.  More getting to the point!  Lerner goes on and on and I found myself bored with the stories.  I'm reading for answers.  There are so many stories and you really have to hunt for clues as to WHAT TO DO IN YOUR OWN LIFE.  If you're reading a self-help book, then obviously you just may need some help now.  And fishing for "what to do" isn't productive.  I just didn't like the flowy, story telling way of writing.  To me, she spent a lot of time writing the history of a problematic relationship and then what the patient WANTED to achieve and then not so much as to what was needed to fix the problem for a positive outcome.  Too many times I read the phrase, "we'll get to that later."  
 I listened to all the tracks on this album and I cant understand. Hi-tek-you can do way better than this. Ive heard your work in the past and I know your potential, you can come with better beats than this for real. Lyricist lounge 2 and others you did had way iller beats. I guess you've been away for too long 
 I admired Lutz's throughness in accruing examples, and there are many interesting sidebars and historical illustrations, but there's almost no point to this book at all. It reads somewhat like Marjorie Garber's latest  works, except it's even more "lite"--it's as if he had been so  busy finding things to discuss relative to tears that he forgot to spend  time actually discussing what sorrow and sentiment and sentimentality  actually mean 
 I bought this book based on the other reviewers' comments. This book is a piece of junk !  Don't buy it and waste your money.  These professors should not be allowed to write books and force it on their students.  There are better books on probability and Measure Theory.  Try Marek Capinski and Ekkehard Kopp.  Yes, I bought this too through Amazon

 I am a huge CW Fan, own everything he has done.  SO it is so hard to say this- not his best effort.  There are hints of his greatness in this CD but in most cases not realized.  In most cases the songs appear to be little more than interesting ideas The exception is "Joy" and "Radar"  Very impressive.  For the newbies I suggest "dirt floor", "living wih the law", and "Din&quot 
 Making this unprincipled betrayal of core American values all the more stinging is, by his own confession, his respectably working-class roots, where he grew up next to a gas station in a small New Jersey town. His modestly humble, unpretentious parents even admitted to the room-for-improvement in their lives when they moved to a bigger house from Randolph Street to Institute Street. Springsteen's parents understood the essence of Americanism in its promise of social mobility no matter your background--yet Springsteen spits on this sanctity like Kerry the Defeatist by equating ALL actions of America with tarnishes of "global hegemony", "colonialism", "might makes right", or whatever other socialist-menacing psychosis this unsatisfactory-educated "Boss" invents. Springsteen's been glaringly seduced by the entertainment community's leftist dictatorship and its mentally depraved, conspiring enforcement of herd-mentality that America's the "problem". 
 This is a passable action-based, hack-and-slash story with very little else to recommend it. Detailing the bloody war between two factions of vampires, one of which is merely cruel, manipulative, bloodthirsty (in both the literal and figurative meanings of the word) and soulless, the other of which is actually the bad guys, the story also suffers from a lack of beginning or end, being as it is merely the second in a thirteen-novel storyarc. (The Tzimisce of the title are one of the "clans" or bloodlines, of the more vicious of the two factions, and are themselves vile and sadistic (to say nothing of psychotic) enough to make "normal" vampires seem mild by comparison. 
 I had high hopes for this book, with the description on the inside dustjacket mentioning George RR Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire... NOT. It started well enough I guess, but man o man, did it get convoluted, hard to follow, and boring QUICK. The plot seemed to concern a place called Sunnashiven and how a bunch of angry peasants rise up in revolt under the command of some lordly person who is actually acting under orders from some even more powerful lordly person... To tell ya the truth, I don't even really know - it was such complicated dry boring reading that I didn't have the patience to try to comprehend it all. I got almost halfway thru it before I decided to return it. I liked the idea of an EVIL cleric as the hero... but it was so terribly boring and hard to understand that I didn't even get to the part where he decides to turn evil - and the totally lame name of Llewelyn didn't help. I commend Karen Michaelson for her attempt, but I can only say that she needs to try again - though I will not be along for the ride on the next one. This confirms that women who can write good fantasy are few and far between... Margaret Weis I enjoyed when I was younger, and Robin Hobb more recently. That's it. If you want to read some really good fantasy, read George RR Martin and Guy Gavriel Kay 
 	I Do not recommend this book because of the characters, the lack of a clear objective and the ending, that left me depressed and unsettled. Joel was one of the characters that bothered me. I didn't like the way he handled the situation when his friend died. The way he waited before telling anyone, and they way he acted angry at his parents and the Zabrinskys for no reason at all bothered me a lot. " `Joel', She said, `are you sure you've told us everything you know?' `About what?' he demanded roughly as if he didn't understand what she meant." Another thing I disliked about the book was, there wasn't a clear plot or objective to the story. After Tony's death, the rest of the book was basically about Joel trying to tell someone about it. I found that very boring. The last thing that left a discontented feeling in my mind was the ending. By the middle of the book, I was very sad, and by the end of the book, that feeling never went away. After Tony's death I found that there was no silver lining, or feel of hope at the end. This left me unhappy. The story just sort of cut off, leaving you sad and a little confused. Those were some key reasons I do not recommend the book On My Honor. 
 How can people like this piece of trash?What a stinker!I think the dad died from boredom after listening to his two idiot sons.And all that endless talk about "the Institute" which looked like it was setup in someone's garage.I can understand why some bikers would find this flick motivational.It motivated me to turn off the t.v. and go for a ride.I really believe this movie was produced by Satan 
 This is the second review I have done on this book. My first was never posted....hmmmm....I wonder why?     I am a loan officer. I bought this to see exactly what Reed was filling the general public's head with. Most of the book is geared toward a hatred and distrust of Mortgage Professionals.He tells you just enough to be dangerous, but not enough to really know what's going on.  He actually says that the Realtor is looking out for the clients best interest. Holy COW. What a bunch of crap...... Many of the real estate agents I have worked with are dishonest and fake. I have always tried to be honest an fair to all of my clients.... Usually the loan officer is stuck with saving the deal on a trumped up value the realtor has provided or one of the many other idiotic things that they do. How about laying the blame where it belongs. This book is filled with "dirty little secrets" Nothing you can't find on the internet. Not only that you'll have every bit of a hard time getting a realtor to disclose how much they make from a transaction. ......Many times two or three times what the loan officer makes. We have to disclose every cent.... This guy is a clown. Buy mortgages for dummies; at least there's no bias there. 
 Boy! I like the series, even though there is not much of a story - but the english translation is the worst I have heard in a long time! The translator must have been realy in a bad moode when he did write the script - so much slang from nearly every character is way to much.. 
 I picked up "Reasons to Live" based on Chuck Palahniuk's sterling recommendation in his book "Stranger than Fiction." Hempel's collection contains 15 short stories -- very short as the pieces average about 8 pages each.   Her writing is very clever (as promised), but left me uninterested. The tiny length of each story made the characters and their situations too opaque to care about. Hempel can certainly write a great sentence, but not a great story.   One footnote: "Celia is Back" clearly mirrors a story Palahniuk tells about his own father. I must admit to wondering if some of the high praise came from personal association more than objective evaluation.  
 Believe it or not, we watched this movie from beginning to end--just to see if there's ANY redeeming feature. What a waste of time! We've enjoyed all sorts of movies, from the serious to the ridiculous--but this movie is totally pointless. Pointless doesn't even begin to describe it. What a cheap piece of #%$&@%! If you have any appreciation for the art of movie-making, for a good story, for good acting, for provocative ideas, for a good laugh, or even for the sheer entertainment value of the ridiculous, don't spend any money on it. And please, if you have seen it, add your 2 cents here so that fewer people get duped 
 I find it hard to believe that anyone actually wanted to publish this load of rubbish. Boring people with no character, fairly awful recipes, no plot  What's left ?  Comparing it with Like Water for Chocolate or Sex in the City is the worst kind of publisher's hype. I am SO glad I just got it from the library and didn't waste money on it 
 While the underlying plot had potential, the story dies under its own weight.  There are too many characters (the first hint of trouble is the multi-page listing of characters at the front of the book).  This leads to too little time devoted to character development and too much bouncing around as we follow the many characters around the globe.  The dialog, is terse, contrived, choppy and generally devoid of emotion.  Having loved the Dirk Pitt and Brad Austin line of books from Cussler, I had wanted to like the Oregon Files as well.  Unfortunately, I found Sacred Stone and Golden Buddha to both be underwhelming.  
 Your web-page is misleading.  It quotes, and the image displays, the Middle English original of the poem. The inside pages shown are from the Middle English edition.  However, (and the modernized title should be a giveaway, but it wasn't) the edition on this page is in modern English -- a translation, not Chaucer's poem.  You need to clean up this page, take away the Middle English quotations, state that it's a modern translation, and refer the prospective buyer to the actual, modernized edition -- which the buyer may or may not want (in my case I did not), with assistance in finding the actual Middle English masterpiece 
 Timeline is equivalent to a 99 cent taco. It's an indulgent bit of junk food. Timeline starts with a Hillerman-esque scientist turning up in the middle of New Mexico - an intriguing idea, but goes to the land of mediocracy right after that filled with cartoon characters. There are so many preposterous story elements that it's just really difficult to take seriously. The story is ever-predictable and ludicrous. But, a 99 cent taco is worth the effort if you're real hungry. Go back and read Andromeda Strain. 
 I enjoyed the first two books in this trilogy. However, this third book needs some serious time in the Intensive Book Surgery Unit before it should have even been published. Frankly, this manuscript should have been kicked back from the editor to the author and refused. I realize that's a pretty heavy thing to say, but it's true. Something went badly wrong here.  The author did not do his job in bringing his protagonists to closure; having two kids fall in love, then decide to live apart for the rest of their lives is a complete crock. Puhleaze. I grew to rather like the aeronaut Texan and the explorer, and they're killed to little point. Puhleaze. Iorek the Bear is darn cool, and he barely (sorry) makes an appearance in book 3. Puhleaze. And, by the way, who is Mary, introduced so late in the trilogy, as an underfunded Dark Matter physicist (who just happens to be ... an ex-nun ... now, just wait a minute here, is that heavy handed or what?)... and Dark Matter would be *under* funded? Puhleaze. (Although these days, she'd be working on Global Warming.) And Mrs. Coulter, in a lifetime full of being evil, suddenly has a turn of heart (yes, just like The Grinch), and, in her new fullsome of goodness, helps kill an angel. Huh? What? Say that again?     I was thrilled (not) at Pullman's description of an endless, boring ... [come to think of it, very much like reading Volume III of this trilogy] ... somewhat-Purgatory-Without-Dante's-Skill that apparently is his vision of death. Everyone stands around being ... boring. Gosh, how exciting, what a vision, et cetera. It's duller than the endless views of the Enterprise in Star Trek I. It's more boring than the endless endless views of the Discovery in 2001: A Space Odyssey. When the dead people standing around there are given the chance to decompose, they go for the gusto. As to why any of this should be in a book, I can only offer my puzzlement.       Jerry Pournelle once gave me some terrific advice. "Never give a reader a chance to put down one of your books, because if you do, they will, and they'll never pick it up again.". I zoomed non-stop through the first two books of this trilogy. The last book took me a week plus and I was extremely annoyed with it.   I was amused that Philip Pullman, in his Afterword, gives credit to stealing his ideas (those are his words) from Paradise Lost (John Milton). Frankly, I wish he had stolen more, this book would have been better. His utter hatred of The Church shines through this book. He has sort of an Idiot's Guide to Quantum Mechanics but isn't up on it.     This mess needs to be storyboarded, and everything that does not PROMOTE THE STORY needs to be chucked out. And that's about half of this book. Whoever edited this book badly needs to be chewed out. I suspect, though, that it boiled down to "not enough time to fix" in the publishing schedule; Del Rey is not noted for publishing messes like this.  
 There are a few interesting nuggest in the first few pages and then story, after story, after story.  There's no doubt that their agency is successful but please present some principles and not story, after story, after story.. 
 This is a nice book  which deserved a better proofreading before going to press.  In its current incarnation it is marred with numerous typos not only in the text but in the exercises as well.  It can be very frustrating when the  reader is essentially asked to guess the author's intentions.  My advice to prospective buyers is to wait for the second printing when these errors will hopefully be cleaned up.  
 Great pictures, but did Donald Trump write the story line?  The books ends with a smug Thomas exclaiming "I am first and you are last!"  
 This DVD taught me that if you squeeze too much stuff on a dvd, the picture degrades. All three of the movies on this DVD have terrible resolution, which diminishes any opportunity for enjoyment. The resolution competes with the silly plots and terrible acting so I don't know what's worse. 
 Yum...play food! This is a great set. I will buy it as soon as I find it. This is a great set! Lots of cans (good for storage), ice cream, boxed treats, cookies, (yummy), and of course, much more. And who could resist the spaghetti with meatballs? And is that chocolate chips on the ice cream? Oh my gosh, it's better than I thought. You might think that to have a good time, your child needs 40 dollar Melissa and Doug wooden play food with real cutting noises and a Fisher Price 100 dollar kitchen for imaginative play. Bullpies, I say. I have tons of dollar-store food. I have ultra-realistic foam food from a kitchen set I got. I prefer the dollar store food. Dollar store food is better because it has more in one package, looks real, is cheap, pretty durable, and looks nice. I have a really silly play food set that came with a stovetop (small, but the knobs turn!), a pink and purple propane tank, a can of "barracuda" (seriously), and a can of "barracuda hash" which included barracuda, ham and eggs, chicken, turkey, potpie, and more eggs. But the logo has spam and a hotdog, and the front of it has beans, turkey, fish, sausage, and lots of weird meat. But it says "Eatable, 100% dainty, Present!, Daintiness, Dainty". Just wanted to let you know.  So, bottom line is, dollar store play food is much better than you think it is. It comes with lots of things that the expensive companies would never have dreamed of 
 This book does all right for the writer who does not have the information already.  advice such as, "Poor spelling and grammar puts you at a disadvantage".  really?  did I really need to waste my money on such a book to give me advice on such a wow, I didn't know that :).  she offers very obvious advice like what to do on tours and how to get publicized.  the chapter on Media training, "Television appearances are part of a book's promotion".  hmm...thanks for the great insight!   However, for those who already know some things, this book only glosses over what you really need to know.  I know I need to set up a mailing list for say, a book signing event.  But, she doesn't actually tell you HOW to contact them properly, and where.   don't bother with this book.  get free information on the website by spending your own time googling.   I am author of Legacy of Fire and Wind: Book I: Fires Withi 
 The anti-Peary and anti-Henson vendetta will spare no expense of time, money or effort to advance their agenda. I'd compare this effort to a novel in which Hitler is the hero and Patton is shown to be a frightened little wimp, so worthless that we end up cheering on Adolph. If seeing history's heros, who made tremendous physical sacrifices, demeaned as if buffoons is your cup of tea then this is your kind of reading. Bravo to Random House for putting this one in print, eh 
 I thought that this would be a book with reproductions of typical art deco motifs but it turns out to be one artist's interpretations of Art Deco, and in my opinion the results are pretty ugly.. 
 Van Dyke Parks did the arrangements on Sam Phillips's debut 'The Indescribable Wow', an album I love so much I thought I'd give 'Song Cycle' a shot.  What a feeerocious disappointment! I'd give it zero stars if I could, but amazon wouldn't let me!   My god, that singing voice of his reminds me of David Bowie... "The Laughing Gnome" Bowie, that is... I've seen the word "coy" pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing, er, style, but I'll go them all one better... "smug". All I hear in it is "Ooh, I'm so smart. What a clever lad am I."   The arrangements or orchestrations, or whatever you call them are all pointless. It gives me the feeling that Van's dad bought him an orchestra and said, "Here, son, have fun." So young Van did... without ever really learning how to use it properly. Randy Newman KNOWS how to use an orchestra; check out his best album 'Sail Away'. The arrangements are tasteful and, key word here, SPARE. He never clubs us over the head with them.   The lyrics, if we can call them such, have no attachment whatsoever to the music.... but then again since I wrote that the arrangments are pointless I guess it's to be expected. So, what we have is a trifecta of awfulness: bad voice, bad lyrics, and bad music.  HOWEVER, he did make 'Song Cycle' in 1968 and worked on 'The Indescribable Wow' in 1988... so he did learn a thing or two in 20 years, namely that arrangements are NOT songs; they're used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener... maybe Randy pulled him aside once to tell him that... 
 I mostly bought this book because I am a fan of the TV show Medium and thought this book might give me an idea of who / what the real person was.  I was hoping also to hear more about the criminal profiling aspect of Alison Dubois' "gift".  Unfortuantely none of the above were achieved.  This book seems to be more about telling it's audience to accept the psychic's in their lives.  I didn't feel it gave me any insight into the afterlife.  Overall I was very disappointed 
 I'm not sure who's writing these reviews, but I read repitition after repitition after repitition, with a lot of confusing fluff. Asking hard questions to solve complex or simple issues. What's "fierce" about that?   The writing style and content just didn't flow. Wasn't real. I mean, in one section, she actually uses the term "bucko," as in, "Let me tell you something, bucko." What are we in "Happy Days?" Couldn't take the book seriously after that. Very bad. 
 There are NO English Subtitles as it says there are in the DVD Features. I would think subtitles would be a pretty standard feature in DVD movies these days - Artisan Entertainment is just lazy I guess...    
 I simply spent time watchnig this French response to a Chaplin-style but non-silent motion picture.  Maybe, it was a top at the timing of the making. 
 First of all, I am a Joy Division and New Order fan; therefore, I tried to like this.  Really, I did.    Sadly, this film stinks.  The focus is not on the bands themselves, but on the obnoxious character known as Tony Wilson.  What a monster!  Either it was the actor's depiction or he does truly have a horrid personality in real life.    Maybe I'm not British, but I did not find 24 Hour Party People to be very funny.  Only a few scenes made me grin.  The randomness added very little to the overall quality of the film.   In addition, the camera work was very jerky.  Looked like it was done by a novice (and yes, I'm one myself, having made two movies)  The only redeeming aspect has to be the scenes with Joy Division.  Too bad the members of this band are minor characters.  I can only hope that the biopic of Ian Curtis currently in production will be much, much better 
 I like Francois Ozon's Swimming Pool a lot. I think he has caught a very exceptional line in that movie. But Under the Sand is a very typical French movie which makes most people don't want to watch one as soon as they hear it is a French movie. I finally persuaded my husband that Francois Ozon is different and this movie will be good, it turned out to be a nightmare, pointlessly soul strangeling movie. I would not recommend unless you are a big fun of Ozon or this type of movies 
 This teacup has a beautiful design, but I was very disappointed when I received it.  The cup and saucer were much thicker than I would have expected for a china teacup!  It also had a problem with the scalloped design for the foot of the cup as this caused the cup to rock as it sat on the saucer.  I sent it back as I could not imagine trying to drink tea from this cup 
 The grinder is beautiful but the mechanics sure need some work ... I use a french press and according to the manual it should be set at "1" for a french press ... the grind is so large no water penetrates it.  So if you are using a french press you need to set it at 6 or 7.  This is fine as long as you NEVER want espresso 
 The Columbia Sportswear story is one of the most compelling business building stories of our time.  However, this books is a totally incomplete treatise.  It is well written and somewhat captivating, but way too summarized if you expect to learn anything useful.  It is a waste of time to read, although you'll only have to waste 20 minutes to read the entire book 
 JAK books are, imho, one of the best in the market right now.Her stories are spun from a truly talented mind, with determined yet understanding heroines and dark brooding heroes, and laced with humour and wit that never fail to bring smiles and laughter. PERFECT PARTNERS however, sadly lacked this winning JAK formula. It comes across as an absolutely frustrating novel, with a bossy and oftentimes irritating heroine, and a narrow-minded  henpecked hero.Definitely the worst JAK book around 
 First of all, if you haven't read the rest of the "Gridlinked" series, don't bother, this novel will be utterly incomprehensible to you. Most of the major plot points are set up in earlier books, and all (ALL) of the characterization of the major characters is set up in earlier books, leading them to drag around in this book like so many paper mache' characters. The new characters are drawn well, but it's assumed you already know the old characters, so they're just shoved around like chess pieces.   Neal Asher has written a lot of good stuff, but this one is, at best, merely readable. Buy it only if you've read the previous books in the Gridlinked series and want to see how he ties up all the lagging plot points. Sorry, Neal 
 This is a real electronic sounding band that has no guitar solos or good vocals. Infact they are not real good at all. All they have going for them is the lyrics, and they are getting old. They are so simular to the Hybrid theory. All of the songs sound genaric and not real fancy or hard to do. Its all in the synth. I cant say I love it, or even that its just OK. I owned it for years but I finally sold it, thank god 
 Gave up after 64 pages, what a sham, the heroic hero calls his SEAL buddy Harry, the man's name is Dan Harris, the President is called Woody for no explained reason as his name is Robert X. Hayes, Ramstein Air Base, Germany is called Ramstein Air Force Base, the White House security people will let just anyone in to see the Pres, you can't be serious, "the hero's lean biceps bulged under the fabric of his black polo shirt he was wearing" did we have to be told that he was wearing the shirt after being told of the bulging business, either consign this joke to the trash can or give it to a person that you really dislike. Minus 3 stars 
 This book was easy enough to read, it just wasn't what I expected from Quindlen.  I usually find her writing style and her way of thinking about things so captivating, in this book I really did not find either of those traits to stand out.  The back-and-forth from current day to the past was somewhat confusing, and sometimes I was in the middle of a paragraph before I realized this paragraph was a jump to the past, whereas the previous paragraph was present time.  Although I got used to that writing style, I always found it annoying.  The storyline itself never sold me either: a typical, young "sew-your-wild-oats" boy finds a baby and decides to keep it and is the "perfect" father. I just did not find such an occurrence likely.  And, as a mother myself, all the times he either left the newborn alone or took it with him while he labored on the land just made me squirm. Anyway the whole story seemed far-fetched and disjointed to me, and a disappointment especially since I have been a Quindlen fan for many, many years 
 The first part of the book is thrilling and page turning. The way Judge Ramsey found Emma. The way Molly found Judge Ramsey. Everything will keep you in the book. But the last hundred pages or so she really misses the plot. You'd ask yourself where's the plot? You'll read about a propousal, Ireland, a wedding, and many more stories that shouldn't been there. And as nigh all of her books, the end is a fairy tale that nobody'll believe. There are better books than this one 
 When I received this set it contained no Disk #2 and 2 Disk #5s. I have e-mailed the seller to see if they will rectify the situation and I'm waiting for their response 
 If you're a fan of Mineo's and you're looking to add another piece of material to a media collection, buy this book and keep it on a shelf somewhere.  If you would prefer to gain some insight into a complicated life, move on.  This is the kind of biography I abhor:  its content is almost entirely derived from fan magazines, press releases and newspaper clippings.  To make matters even worse, it attempts to pass itself off as a serious work when it should be mass paperback sized and sold alongside the Jonbenet Ramsey and Scott Peterson quickie books at the supermarket.  Peppered throughout the book is superfluous information that appears to have no value aside from increasing the page count(for instance, an entire page is devoted to listing the contents of the theatre owners press book for "Crime in the Streets.")  So many people who were a part of Mineo's personal and professional life are alive and the author appears not to have contacted any of them, conducted one interview or gathered any new material whatsoever.  What makes that even more frustrating is that the author was acquainted with Mineo during the last several years of his life and alludes that writing this book was a mission he needed to undertake. Unfortunately the inclusion of a few of his personal conversations with Mineo (some having to do with Mineo's rather convenient wish that the author write his Bio) are no substitute for a well researched biography and the insights of an expert.  If you'd like to read a fascinating book on a somewhat similar person, find a copy of Charles Winecoff's "Split Image: The Life of Anthony Perkins.&quot 
 Having worked in the mental health community for sometime, I was already familiar with this technique and have been using it already.  I felt the book was really droll and somewhat condescending in tone.  I wouldn't purchase it again.  His companion book "Why Employees Don't Do What They're Supposed to Do and What to Do about It" is a more practical read and enjoyable too--I would recommend that one 
 It is really difficult to like a book where there are no likeable characters.  Morgan is a middle aged man who leaves his wife and many children for a much younger woman (that he seems to stalk for a while).  There are so many disturbing factors in this book that revolve around the main character (stalking of his new wife, impersonating a doctor, impersonating a postal worker, etc) that it made it very difficult to empathize with any of the emotions he might have had.  The book also seems to 'glaze' over the 'weirdness' of these behaviors.  
 This book is what I would call hard to read, unless of course you already have a masters degree in Florentine art. As a student in an art history class that required this as one of our reads, I can say this book is crap, yes I mean crap. I have read many more well written books covering this subject in an easier to read format. I would defiantly not recommend this overpriced piece of firewood 
 I've read a lot of backpacking books and go on backpacking trips each month.  A lightweight pack is a better way.  You'll love this book, if you think a 5,000ci pack is required for 2 night trips and a 4,000ci pack is required for an overnight, if you think heavy boots are required, or bringing a heavy fleece jacket or wool sweater is good advice.  It covers a lot of different topics.  Unlike other books written by "traditional" backpackers, such as O'Bannon's Backpackin' Book, I didn't feel like I skimmed some good ideas from a knowledgeable and experienced traditionalist backpacker.  It was mainly regurgitating dogma, some of which is good advice (but readily available from other sources) and much of it myth 
 As an Eco fan, I could not wait to read his latest novel. Sadly, I was deeply disappointed by this pompous, self-indulgent, virtually unreadable monster. The cultural and literary references are obscure and incomprehensible unless you are a 70-something Italian librarian.    
 I had the good fortune of going to college during the prime days of the Columbus, Ohio hip-hop scene, so not only have I been a fan of RJD2's almost since the beginning, I used to go see him spin on a weekly basis. That being said, I can tell you this album is exactly the sort of music he's always wanted to make. The only problem I have is the songs aren't very good.   No one's going to argue RJ's proficiency as a beat composer or producer. He's also shown a high degree of competency in the art of creating a song. However, none of that skill is on display on "The Third Hand." It's not that the music is horribly offensive or that the songs lack structure, it's that he foolishly chose to build the songs around his vocals. RJ's vocal abilities flat out suck. As wonderful a producer and as nice as a guy as he is, it pains me to say that, but it's true. His vocals are frequently out of tune - bordering on screeching - and are horrifically off key. His vocals sound like a ferret is being tortured, and while I don't know what that sounds like, I don't imagine I'm far off.  I'm all for artists experimenting and taking chances, it's why I bought the CD after reading bad review after bad review. However, what artists like RJ and his contemporary, DJ Shadow, don't realize is over the years their stage names have taken on a certain branding by their audiences. Just as I wouldn't expect to pick up a Jack Johnson CD and expect to hear him singing Frank Sinatra songs, I don't expect to pick up a RJD2 CD and expect to hear RJ screeching and wailing for an hour.   Honestly, if, hypothetically speaking, Jack Johnson wants to sing Frank Sinatra like songs or if RJ wants to sing folk songs, I'm fine with that. I just expect the new material to be on the same level of quality as the songs they've been putting out for the past 10 years. In RJ's case, the songs on "The Third Hand" aren't as high in quality as any of the work he's put out in the past. RJ, we know you're capable of more than this. "Making Days Longer" off of "Since We Last Spoke" is a beautiful song that will stand the test of time as long as "The Horror" or any other song you've made in the past, but nothing on "The Third Hand" even hints at the genius that was on display in either one of the former two songs. 
 This is a good book, but most are under the impression that Einstein actually CREATED the content of the book.  Einstein actually compiled the physics theories of the latest German and Italian physicists and wrote it as his entire theory.  For instance, e=mc^2 was not created by Einstein, as so many people people. An Italian physicist came up with it. If you don't believe me check any encyclopedia.  Einstein suceeded in taking everyone's work and compiling it. This was helpful to the world of physics.  Unfortunately, this stuff is outdated, and Autodynamics has disproven many things that Einstein says in this book. When it came out it was already outdated. This was published in the 60s. Autodynamics disproved what is in this book in the 40s (45 I believe). If this was published in the 20s or even the 30s, it would have been a good book 
 I kept waiting for the good part to begin.  The set up for the crime is long and tedious and there is very little excitement in the actual theft or in its aftermath.  I couldn't wait until it was over.  Save your time and  read something else 
 I kept thinking it would make sense or get better or have some substance.   It was remarkably bad!   I threw it away after reading 200 pages or so and it only has 277.  What a waste of time and money!!!!!!!.. 
 With a complex game like Heroes you want some good fold out tables and charts of the different troop-types and heroes.  You dont get that.  The entire book is in black and white.  Most of the guide is simply a walkthrough of the Campaign missions.  Bleh.  That would have been fine to include that but fans of this game want tables and charts in a readable format.  Very unfortunate how bad this "guide" is. I regret buying it 
 "A Facsimile of the original edition" ? My mother has an original copy (7th edition) which was handed down to her & it is now held together with tape & love. Borrowing that book from my mom made me a bit nervous so I wanted to get one for myself. I did a lot of reading of reviews & finally decided on this one. Yes it does have all recipes that the original had but without ANY cooking temperature (electric, gas or internal temps). Even the time tables on page 32 & 33 with cooking times didn't have the temperatures that they needed to be cooked at. My mother's does except the charts are in a different area of her book. I am sorry but I am not going to sit down with a brand new cook book & take my mother's book & write down what temperature every single recipe needs to be cooked at. There was one recipe that state "cook for 20 mins. at a very high temp" & my mothers book said " cook for 20 mins. at 450 F". It almost looks like the temperatures were purposely left out because everything else appeared to be the same. Copyrights problems?  I am returning this book because it didn't meet my expectations & felt it was misrepresented 
 I am a beginner at stumpwork and fancy stitches but not at ribbon embroidery or ribbon flowers. I wanted a book with more than just ribbon embroidery so I bought this one. To my disappointment, the instructions consist of pictures of different stitches with no explanations. And then later in the book some basic instructions on how to do those stitches in little projects. So ok, I'm supposed to look at the pictures in the beginning of the book and figure out how to do those stitches without any written instructions (some are very easy, but several of the hard ones left me stumped and very frustrated.) And if I only have pictures to work with then how about enough pictures so I can see which step comes first! How about some lessons in technique! So then after the stitches part now you do the projects except well those are hard to figure out too because of the bare minimum instructions given or none at all. Like where it says: Covering a bead with thread.  Yep that's it just look at the picture and figure it out. Ok so what's the technique? Do I wrap the string around and around through the hole until the bead is completely covered? Or through the hole and then diagonal? And how is it finished off when you've covered the bead? And how is it attached to your project? What is the best technique? Well I still don't know because there are no instructions. That's just a small example of how annoying this book is. So if I want to do a lot of the things in this book then I'll need to buy another book to explain how to figure out this book. So It's not for beginners because it's too confusing but I know it's also not for experts because this stuff is too basic. Yes well needless to say this book is going back to where it came from.  I need an aspirin for this seventeen dollar headache.. 
 I did not have "great" expectations after reading some of Mr. Dickens other work (see my review of "Tale of The Two Cities").  But someone told me they at least made a movie about this one so I figured I may as well give it a shot.  Well lets just say that I wont be seeing the movie but I will admit that this one is at least better then the other book because it is just thick enough to balance out this wobbly dresser I have when I weged it under one of the legs.  A better effort!  I give you a generous TWO STARS this time Charlie!  Youre getting there so keep trying 
 I was really disappointed in this book.  I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it 
 I would have given this book an additional star if it wasn't for the terrible art on the cover. I was embarrassed to read this novel in public. The marketing for this series really cheapens the writing. My friends laugh at me when I show them these books, then insist they are good. I would never buy such an ugly book in hardcover. Get with the times, TOR 
 Term Limits is so bad, it should become a pop culture icon ala Rocky Horror Picture Show; fans should be made to wear strange clothing and recite the worst passages to music at midnight. It's so bad that by the end, the act of reading has become blatant rubber-necking - ooh, wow, did you see that?  Ugh!   The writing is amateurish at best.  The author's favorite action verb is 'grab' and he uses it repeatedly in scenes ranging from the mundane (the grabbing of keys and doorknobs) to the romantic (the grabbing of hands and other body parts).  Similes and metaphors are conspicuously absent, but there are plenty of adverbs and adverbial phrases to fill the gap.   The author switches back and forth between referring to his characters by their first and their last names; sometimes he uses one and then - in the very next sentence! - the other. "Michael grabbed her by the shoulders and turned her around. O'Rourke saw the tears in her eyes and tried to put his arms around her..."  He makes many grammatical errors, the most irritating of which is the substitution of 'that' for 'who' consistently ["Congressman O'Rourke received this tape earlier today along with a letter from the assassins that were responsible for killing..."]  The dialogue is stilted and clunky - at the lowest point, he has his assassin ask another character to tell him what has 'transpired' since last they talked.  Rather than simply 'saying' things, the characters yell, shout and scream them, resulting in the unfortunate image of the president of the United States waxing shrill and screechy at his chief of staff.  The plot is neither plausible nor compelling.  The protaganists include a bunch of renegade CIA operatives who murder 'bad' politicians, and a Congressman who approves of these actions and even helps to kidnap and murder a 'bad' retired CIA black ops director.  The antagonists include the aforementioned black ops director, the head of the national security agency, and the bumbling and ridiculous White House chief of staff.  The demand made by the 'good' assassins, following their murder of four prominent politicians, is that the president present a BALANCED BUDGET with NO NEW TAXES to the Congress!  Our intrepid hero-Congressman finds this a worthy cause, and when some 'good' politicans (i.e. the sort who push for the balanced budget idea) are murdered, he is inspired to wreak some violence of his own.  No one, whether they be protagonist or antagonist, seems to possess a moral compass.  'Bad' guys can be murdered indiscriminately and no consequences will be applied; the murder of a 'good' guy may be avenged, again, without consequence. The climax and its aftermath are laughably bad; of course, I can't reveal the ending, but let me just point out that the climax begins with a bunch of CIA operatives sneaking into a house by jumping out of a helicopter hovering overhead.  Apparently, this is some kind of silent helicopter, because the people inside the house were unaware of its presence.  That this book was published at all, much less that it received initial printings large enough to place it on the bestseller list, is emblematic of everything that has gone wrong with publishing.  It stands as a slap in the face to every talented writer in the country. 
 I think the originals in japanese of real emotion and 1000 words were much better. I don't really like Jade's voice. It seems too sharp. Also, the recording sounds kind of low quality. Even though I don't understand the japanese version, I prefer the japanese version over this english version. 
 I remember growing up with my mom having this fragrance, everytime she wore it she made me want to gag. It's horridly strong and gives headaches and just flat out stinks! Sense of smell is a very different and particular thing, I know people who love this perfume, Though I hate it some who like "kickers" will love it 
 The best of Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book stories took place in the man village because that's where Mowgli meets a superstitious old hunter named Buldeo.   Buldeo claims that the tiger Shere Khan is supernatural,  the ghost of a wicked old money lender.  When Mowgli says that Shere Khan is only a very disagreeable tiger Buldeo threatens to spank our young hero.    When Buldeo learns that Mowgli has a vendetta with the tiger and a black panther as his personal body guard the old man tells the other villagers that Mowgli is a demon child who is able to turn himself from a boy to a wolf, and back to a boy at will.  This is great story telling.  But where is Buldeo?  He isn't in the movie at all!  It's like leaving the Wicked Witch out of the movie version of "The Wizard of Oz".  On a side note, in the Kipling stories the black panther Bagheera has a secret so shameful he can tell no one but Mowgli.   Bagheera was born in a zoo, chained and keep in a cage for the amusement of men.  But rather than blame Mowgli for the cruelty he suffered in captivity Bagheera sees the boy as a kindred spirit.  They were both separated from their own kind at an early age.  Once we have that bit of information the relationship between the boy and the panther makes sense.   We are able to understand Bagheera's total devotion to the Mowgli.  But the movie never explains that.  I realize that the movie shouldn't follow the book completely.   But since the book was so much richer the movie seemed like a let down 
 I really didn't like this book.  I bought this and what to expect when you are expecting.  I prefered the other.  I found this lacking in concrete developmental info about the fetus.  There were too many "write in questions" and personal anicdotes and not enough facts.  I will probably sell this book in my yard sale or send it to goodwill as I really didn't find it helpful at all 
 This is not a paperback edition of the book!  This only a study guide which includes notes.  If you are looking for the actual book...this is not it, even though it says that 
 I tried this book based off of several of the positive reviews and was disappointed.  The "cute" stories and rock and roll music references was not enough to keep it interesting.  Sure risk is a difficult subject but this book did not come up with anything new or innovative on the subject.  Likewise, the basic premise the author uses of levering and delevering your portfolio based on p/l or perceived opportunities may work fine if the markets are highly liquid and transactions costs are minimal such as in large cap stocks but it is much more complicated for other stratgies and markets.  How does the book address converts, mortgages, options, distressed debt, etc?  I will save you the money and tell you- it doesn't.  Now this may not be an issue if you are a short term oriented active trader of stocks ala SAC or scalping e-minis but for the rest of us that are involved in other strategies it is of zero value.  
 Our almost-4 year old son loves dragons and has one of the Imaginext dinosaur sets, so we thought we'd really surprise him on Christmas this year with the Imaginext dragon set.  While I'm very happy with how happy my son is with it (he's been playing with it for hours) I have a feeling we're going to be in much the same boat as some other reviewers.  Pros:  - Interesting color scheme - Good detail on most pieces - Re-configurable - The dragon figure is really neat - The trap door, rotating floor and other moving parts are a lot of fun for my son to operate - Got it on sale at the local Toys R' Us for 11 dollars less than listed on the web site.  Cons - The directions are picture-only, and much too small to see fine detail. - The pieces are not packaged together logically, so that the elements of the set are all in one bag. You have to open every bag and lay the pieces out in order to be able to find everything and even then there's some question as to whether you've got the right part turned the right way, per the above comment about the directions. - The whole thing comes tumbling down like a house of cards if you bump against it lightly/during casual play. I've had to put it back together no less than 5 times since I initially put it together this morning. Some of the connector pieces don't fit tightly enough into the sockets on other pieces, so they tend to just slide out instead of locking together firmly.  I think that next year, we'll just stick to Legos 
 I'm a fan of Koontz but this book was a disappointment. First of all it seems that not much happens. Molly, the main character, goes around worrying about what will happen next and the writer spends way too much time philosophing. It's too cutesy with children and dogs (Koontz, please, the super intelligent dog concept is getting tired). For most of the book it would be a 3 star book, but the ending is too cheesy and religious. What will he write next? A "Left Behind" book 
 This router drops my connection every few minutes.  I've spent hours on the phone with Belkin and replaced the whole thing.  A quick internet search finds dozens of people reporting the same problem, with no solution offered.  It's just no good 
 This book contains a lot of information that seems so dated.  The author seems like she's pretty out of touch with modern nutritional knowledge.  What this book taught me: Food processing makes food safe and yummy.  The US RDA is a respected guideline.  Antibotics and hormones make livestock healthy and efficient.  Wake up lady.  If you are looking for up-to-date health information on topics such as: natural vitamins vs. synthetic vitamins, the nutritional value of bleached flour, micronutrients, carcinogens, or food additives, don't bother with this book.  It is like a text book from the 1950s, written with a cutesy style that grates on you when you realize how inaccurate the information is 
 My daughter who is 5, held the bear up to a light too long and it fell on her leg and caused a severe burn! I am aware my daughter over charged the bear, but they are intended for children this age and I am sure that my daughter will not be the last one to do this. I did contact the company that manufatured it, and I had to send pics and the bear, BUT he told me flat out that they would not be re-called :( They did send toys for her and her 3 siblins as a peace offering BUT that does not dismiss that it can cause a severe burn!!! [... 
 I have been waiting on 2 cd's for almost two months. I am yet to receive "Journey of a Gemini", or "Blue Collar Music". If possible, can I be reimbursed, or sent another copy of each cd. Please let me know. Thank you.  
 Who the **ck are GNR?? Plus they make awful music! I can't stand this annyoing album. The music is awful, so as the lyrics. There is not ONE good song on this piece of s**t. It is a album that contains 12 crappy songs. AXL ROSE is a very annoying lead singer just screams and sings horribly, and SLASH is terrible too. In THE WAY STAY AWAY FROM THIS AS WELL AS GNRS OTHER ALBUMS.

 The idea is original, and the characters are dynamic, but the writing is shoddy. The author, while obviously imaginative enough to concoct such a story, falls down on her style and usage by literally making up words. The noun form of "perplexed" is not "perplexion"; it's perplexity. A person does not "dangle" a child on his knee, but dandles it. One can only assume that the editor was asleep while reading this book, as well as those that follow 
 The book reads like a gripping novel. Unfortunately, the evidence the author uses is pretty much innuendo, hearsay, and rumor. Having been a student there, his comments are exaggerated. Yes, there are some problems about the curriculum and professors who deem themselves self-important, but I doubt this problem is only at Harvard. This book capitalizes on the desire in America to see the  top stumble once in a while 
 I picked up this book hoping to have a better understanding of the Irish past, and all I got was a racist slant on an otherwise abused people. It is sad that even in the modern day the Irish must still deal with racist garbage like this. Mr. Ignatiev should try reading more on the Irish before writing a book of half-truths and presumptions 
 The very concept of this book is deeply offensive to anyone who values freedom of speech and thought, or good writing.  Don't these people realize that they are engaging in intentional brainwashing?  You can't change reality by changing the words; you have to change it by changing the reality.  Resist these intellectual totalitarians at every opportunity!  Use (and treasure) precise, vigorous language, eschew emasculated, politically correct twaddle 
 The author had all the elements for a good mystery/suspense except for one thing, the lack of an end or resolution to the mystery.  I find it difficult to believe the author of such noted works as Bag of Bones and The Stand would leave his readers hanging in such a manner. Fiction should be about conflict and resolution and we have the basis for the conflict. A body turns up on the beach and the only clue comes from a pack of cigarettes found on the body. We learn the man was from Colorado but very little else.  If the author had brought the story to a meaning conclusion it might well have been a classic mystery or crime thriller but unfortunately the reader is left to wonder what really happened. I would recommend a Mary Higgins Clark mystery in place of this boo 
 I love Heinlein.  I think that he has a unique voice and perspective in the world of science fiction.  I find that his plots and ideas are inventive.  Even this story was inventive in many ways, like some of the business ideas in regards to the new source of energy in the first chapters.  However, I found this book as a whole to be very boring.  Much of this is due to the lack of fully fleshed characters.  The "main" characters of each section of the book aren't fully realized at all.  I wouldn't recommend this book unless you picked it up for free and were really, really bored 
 I usually enjoy reading Tom Robbins' novels, but this one I could not even finish. I had to force myself just to get halfway through it. There is really no plot, which makes it difficult to read. I am disappointed with this book 
  Just awful slasher picture with not one hint of real talent behind it. The first movie I ever walked out of,and I was home!!!! THE PITS!!!!!!! 
 Unfourtunately, after the anticipation was over. I started into the program and found it never really got moving. It was nice to see Joe talk about things and demonstrate some things, but it didn't meet my expectations of Joe Morello. Thought he would of been more technical. For a begineer this could be a good DVD. 
 ...you can waste your time and save your money by checking this out of your local library.  If you want to get an "inside view" of the inner workings of Wall Street during the excessive gyrations of the '80s, then read Den of Theives - that book is well written and well worth the money!  What turned me off about this book was the structure and the writing style.  The first half of the book was essentially the author relating fortuitous circumstances that were the product of Serendipity.  He was simply in the right place at the right time, had virutally no idea how he got there, felt out of place the whole time (even when he was raking in the Big Bucks in NY and London), and so now he thought he'd wwrite a book about it.  I also got the sense that he was trying to assuage some guilt from his association at Salomon Brothers.  He was there, he made a lot of money, good for him - get over it!  I was also pretty disappointed because the subject matter has A LOT more potential.  I might have actually enjoyed it - had I not read Den of Theives 7 years earlier, and already had some idea of how things took place.  But, if you can get it for $5 or less (including shipping), and you have little to no knowledge of what an investment banker's life is like (and you haven't also seen the movie Wall Street (which covers the same highlights in this book)), then it's probably worth it.  I did like the wrap up he did towards the end of the book, relating where he had heard everyone from the firm ended up...althought that seemed a little rushed.. 
 I could sum up this book very quickly:  1) Trust in God for everything  2) Read the Bible  3) Attend church  4) Ask your husband, church, other Christians for help  The book is full of fluffy ideas like: "We need to know ourselves the way God knows us" "Find a Christian counselor" and advice for single mothers to simply attend church if seeking help.  The book primarily revolves around the Bible and its interpretation of parenting. Why not cut out the middle-man and just read this "wonderful book?" It's not like the Bible is a work in progress.   This book is more about proselytizing and keeping Evangelicals reading "inspired" books rather than competing viewpoints. And with America being one of the most pure Christian nations in the world ( US is more Christian than India is Hindu and Israel is Jewish ). Anything published by Zondervan should be looked at skeptically.   I also dislike how males are stilled deemed unworthy parents in the Christian community. They can assist and help , but cannot be considered primary parents. But given this books lack of true substance, I doubt it would have made any difference 
 TERRIBLE!!!Too many mistakes.Mr Hurd don't know the first thing about a correct Chevelle restoration.Too bad its the only Chevelle restoration book available.Stick to assembly manuals and original dealer books for your best source of information.This book don't cut it! 
 I didn't make it the whole way through this densely written and intimidating book, but I was absorbed by one aspect: its portrayal of the human interaction between Marx and Engels.   Karl Marx was a psychologically warped semi-genius who continually begged money and favors from his hardworking and enabling friend Friedrich Engels. Sometimes Marx would agree to write articles or essays that he couldn't produce - he manipulated Engels into ghostwriting, and still collected the pay himself.  I also found it interesting that Engels developed his ideas on the class system while he was in England, observing the human experience in industrialized Manchester, which was at that time economically depressed and in a state of social unrest, with a great disparity between the factory owners and workers.  Marx and Engels wrote each other numerous multi-language letters over the years, and _To the Finland Station_ does a nice job tracing this correspondence. It was interesting to learn that spreading their doctrine into Russia was sort of an incidental afterthought, but  I'm afraid I could not bring myself to sift through the intricacies of the development of socialism/communism.     This is a weighty book, and will not be of interest to every reader 
 It is imbecilic people like Michael Ledeen who contribute to the current U.S. foreign policy which separates the "good" countries and the "terrorists." It is common knowledge that the U.S. has a habit of supporting dictatorships, terrorist movements & groups throughout its history. Yet, the U.S. and people like Ledeen have the gall to declare a battle of "good vs. evil." Simply, the U.S. will support a regime whether it sponsors terrorism or not, if it so suits their interests. You have the Central Asian republics for example, Central American in the '80s, Saddam & Taliban in the '80's, Israel now, the list goes on and on. So, this "war" against the "terror masters," is a way the U.S. gov't can fool the American people into bloated military expansionism, imperialism, and a militant unilateralism that will ultimately cause its own demise. And, sorry to be the bearer of bad news but  the U.S. will NOT win for among other things, peak oil & the decline of the dollar will bring down the U.S. economy and hence military-industrialist complex very soon. In fact, the process has already begun with the Iraq war. The U.S. is no exception to the rises and falls of empires of the past, and in fact the collapse will be proportional to its size 
 I've been a subscriber to this for over 10 years and I've loved getting this, but it has undergone changes recently and NOT for the better. Specifically, I hate what they've done to the graphical design inside. Whereas they used to employ several different styles when it came to things like fonts and artwork for whatever subject was written about, now they've adopted a uniform style where nearly EVERYTHING looks the same. It looked better BEFORE. The writing isn't as witty or sharp (have longtime staff departed?), and there are "filler" pieces in the form of moronic sidebars and boxes - useless attempts at humor that simply don't work. The strength of the magazine continues to come from the critics, especially the movie and dvd section. Sadly, typically, when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like I'm going to have to consider letting my sub expire 'cos I don't let my mailbox fill with crap like this 
 I really wanted to give Superman Volume 3 a full 5 stars, but unfortunately the quality control of the DVD release is poor, hence the 1 star rating.  The DVD set I purchased skipped at the Green Lantern episode.  The replacement I got also skipped at the same place.  In addition, the two-sided disc format with which all three DVD volumes have been released is a damage prone format.  Luckily I was able to get a full refund, but at this point I'm not sure if or when I'll try my chance at buying this set again.    The lack of quality control is too bad, because Volume 3 contains some of the best episodes of the whole series.  If you are fortunate enough to get a DVD set free of defects, then you are really in for a treat.  Bruce Timm and company bring the same high level of storytelling to Superman as they did on Batman: The Animated Series.  Of particular note is an ongoing subplot involving the villain Darkseid throughout the series.  It finally gets put front and center in several episodes of Volume 3, and leads straight to the very powerful and dramatic series finale.  I felt that the finale could have been written out across three episodes instead of two due to the scale of the story, but nevertheless it is a great ending for a great series 
 I not fan of Linsay Lohan but also have nothing against her acting... didn't had... I bought this movie just to enjoy some nice movie, but i was SO wrong.. this movie is absolutely stupid... and very disappointing.  I just watched Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, well there's 1 hour and 20 minutes of my life that I'll never get back! Truly Appalling. It didn't make sense. It didn't flow. It was totally unbelievable. It had terrible characters. It had a terrible script, and possibly worst of all they tried to make it into a musical type thing...very unwise!  Avoid at all costs if u favour your sanity, it's boring, predictable and badly written 
 Nice broad brushstroke overview of Six Sigma, but never really got into the heart of the matter.  Certainly not a book to check out just prior to an implementation kick off- more in line with mulling over the "does Six Sigma matter to me" question.  
 John Mayer can grow his hair long and play his guitar slung low, but he is still a professionaly trained monkey, I mean musician. Mayer along with "artists" like Gavin DeGraw, Teddy Geiger, etc., are todays N'Sync and Backstreet Boys, nothing more.  
 It is missing information about who were the actual thinkers on whose views the theory Postcolonialism is based 
 I purchased this book for an overview of Acrobat 6.0. While there is some good info, too much is not explained fully. There are constant cross references "see chapter 8", no page reference and the bulk of the book is for the pro version. The author spends a lot of time using fancy nomenclature (not technical terms) instead of offering better tips. I would love to see a Special Edition Using Acrobat from Que Publishing. That series is excellent for learning software. I will look for a better book. 
 I bought a sharp lcd tv from j& r in new york last Jan, after a year and half, when powering on the tv, sometimes works, sometimes not. after unplug in, wait for a while and plug back, worked for a couple months. Send it to service center to checkup, was told that the lcd control board needs to be replaced. when request to get back the replaced lcd control board, was told that sharp does not give back the replaced board, it has to be shipped back, otherwise, you have to pay additional fee to get back the replaced board.. it's rather strange to hear such a lousy policy from any vendor..  But, if you do want to get a sharp, better get a long long warranty.. 
 Despite what others would have me believe, I do not remember chuckling, much less laughing, at any moment while reading this book.  I just kept patiently waiting for a story, or even a point, to surface, but after finishing the Epilogue I didn't find either 
 Using the Color Wonder Finger Paints is basically like dipping your hand in Vaseline.  It's greasy, hard to wash off, and stains.  I would never buy this again nor for anyone else.  I strongly urge against purchasing this product.  Crayola, shame on you 
 This book was listed on our summer reading list the summer before I started law school, so I bought it.  It is still in brand-new, perfect condition.  Why?  Because I tried to read it.  And failed.  Miserably.  I was a philosophy major in college.  I generally have a lot of patience for long, dense, boring works.  But this one?  I understood it, but I didn't find it worth my time.  This book is a key Libertarian text.  I am not a Libertarian.  I am a Liberal.  There seemed to be nothing in the book with which I could identify.  The views of the author were SO far from mine that I just felt like it was a waste of time for me to read it.  And that's not a decision I regret 
 "This has been a story of an American soldier whose involvement in the making of the world's greatest dictionary was singular, astonishing, memorable and laudable - and yet at the same time wretchedly sad." - Prologue.  Well, that certainly could have been the story.  But what it was was a history of the dictionary (as in "the history of the horse") with W.C. Minor's contributions finally gotten to on page 116 or so.  Winchester, the author of several other books I'll avoid, also seems to suffer from the common malady - or unwillingness - of not knowing how to end a book.  So the last fifty pages sink the poor reader into...the history of insanity/dimentia/Alzeihmer's, whatever you want to call what Minor suffered.  Whereas I should have shed a tear when the main character - assuming it wasn't a dictionary - was laid to rest at age 85, I was fairly glad to see him go. 
 THIS IS THE WORST SONG I LISTED TO IN MY LIFE  IT SOUND LIKE A BANRE 
 This book is an opinionated overview of some scientific literature relating to human behavior, intermixed with a conservative political agenda and some light-hearted humor.  The book is divided into 4 sections: "In the Beginning" (a scientific history of the world, from the Big Bang to the evolution of humans), "The Rise of Humanity" (hormones and human behavior), "The World Today" (discussion of recent social changes), and "A Look Ahead" (possible futures).  End material includes a short annotated list of books for further reading (8 books plus a list of interesting authors), and an index.  There are no footnotes, endnotes, or other forms of citation of source materials.  I found the best part of the book to be the second section, in which Gilbert summarizes much research regarding innate human behavior relating to gender, romantic pairing, work, and child raising.  While I found little of this information new, Gilbert does an admirable job of presenting it in non-technical language for general readers.  Unfortunately, his complete avoidance of citation makes it impossible to check the accuracy or reliability of his points.  He also tends to overlook facts that would not be supportive of his general thesis that women should be pregnant and raising babies while men are out gathering resources for the family.  For example, after summarizing various statistics about how pregnancy and childbirth reduce risk factors for certain cancers, he states "Early pregnancy, multiple pregnancies, and breastfeeding are simply healthy. Childbirth carries risk, of course, but so does crossing the street or taking an aspirin. Not giving birth seems riskier still." Phew!  I guess he's never heard of the term "maternal mortality."  One of the main claims of the book is that boys and men are being done a disservice by a politically correct agenda which seeks to make the educational and work environments unisex.  As support, Gilbert calls on studies that found children learn better in gender-segregated schools, but suggests that such gender-segregation should be abandoned by the college years "when the maturing sexes really do belong together." (Why stop gender segregation after high school?  The research that supports gender segregated education certainly doesn't show that the advantages of gender segregation are not also found in college-aged students as well.)  He rails against Title IX legislation, which required educational institutions that provide sports programs to provide equal opportunities for men and women athletes, since he feels that by nature, men have stronger physical and mental needs to participate in competitive sports.  (While he supports his arguments against Title IX with examples of perhaps absurd situations in which popular men's programs have been cut so that women's sports with sparse participation could be funded, he entirely overlooks the fact that before Title IX, athletic women had an almost impossible battle to be able to find any playing field to compete on at many schools).  In Gilbert's view, the world would be a better place if women would stick to child-raising and house-keeping, and leave the workplace free for men to live out their genetically determined hunter/gatherer/impregnator behaviors.  He cites hundreds of societal ills, from declining test scores to the widening gap between rich and poor, implicitly suggesting that they all go back to feminism and the re-gendering of society.  In his argument that gender-linked human behaviors are innate and should determine societal structure, Gilbert overlooks normal genetic variation.  While on average, men are taller than women, there are millions of individual women who are taller than millions of individual men.  Likewise, there are no doubt millions of individual women whose competitive urges outpace those of individual men, and many men whose desire to focus on child raising is stronger than the desire of many women to do the same.  In the realignment of society that has occurred particularly in the latter half of the last century, legislation and societal mores have changed so that individuals are freer to follow their own specific genetically determined behaviors.  Brilliant, competitive women are no longer confined to housework, but are free to pursue professional careers if they wish, while their husbands can stay at home with the children if that better suits their temperament.  No society is perfect, and we are far from achieving a perfect match between inherent personality traits and roles in society, but the proposals of this book would take us backwards, not forwards in allowing people to live up to their genetic potential. 
 James Grayson Truelove rides the gravytrain of bait-and-switch coffee table fare.  His chosen form lures the reader in with promises of topics we long to LEARN about, and a few succulent photographs, only to find the actual product, when delivered, bereft of content...frustrating, unsatisfying calories for an audience truly hungry for information and knowledge.  read the reviews for all of his books and you will notice a recurring theme...we've seen most of these houses (even the same shots) in magazines before...readers were hoping for more detail...many people seem really ready for information about how to buck the degrading tide of mainstream housing, how to do it artfully, efficiently, and affordably.  it seems almost cruel to cheat such a group of eager, open-minded, ahead-of-the-bellcurve people whose attempts to thwart the destructive housing industry are going to provide answers for the future.  what a wasted opportunity.  I think Mr. Truelove has the ABILITY, and he obviously has the resources, to do much better 
 Oddly dull, considering the author makes her living by writing and that her writing is on gossip.   I was surprised at how many times I thought to myself, "I guess you had to be there," in response to her narration of an allegedly wild and crazy party.   I was amused when she noted how something or another she wrote created a "sensation." Perhaps they created a sensation among certain cliques in Manhattan or the Hamptons, but they didn't hit my radar screen. Just goes to show how each of us is the center of our own universe.    Possibly the most irksome feature in the book was when she'd refer to "my friend so-and-so" [insert extremely interesting person's name here]in passing, without offering up any information about that person. Instead, she squandered many pages on the likes of the Trumps and others of that ilk.    She kept my interest most when she described her childhood and young adulthood.         
 i was so happy when i first purchased this book but when i finally sat and read it, it was so boring and a drag it was a waste. The story had no purpose nothing was really going on it. This book is juss a waste don't buy this book i wish i coulda gave it no stars it was juss that bad buy beware don't read this 
 As was written by another "(Fouad Ajami) has no axe to grind unlike Ed (sic) Said". True anough Ajami is far too busy being a perfect hound fetching and in his case delivering his master's newspaper. If you want to hear the message you expect to hear because it comforts you read this. But if you wish to know about what is out there give it a rain chec 
 After using it three times, the music started cutting out. On the forth time Using it, my Sansa e260 would not play at all.  When I jiggled my sansa, thinking it was not plugged in all the way to the transmitter, the music cut in & out.  The transmitter was not making good enough contact with my MP3.  I know it's not the MP3, because when I plug it in to charge through my computer, it works fine. 
 Beware of the Everyman's Library edition of this book (green hardcover, ribbon marker, isbn # 0-679-40564-X). Book V dealing with the revenue of the sovereign has been completely ommitted. According to the introduction, this was to limit the book to one volume and keep the price low. I wish I had known this BEFORE I ordered the book since now I have to buy a different edition in order to read Book V. What a ripoff 
 It's sad that this was the best Australia could come up with for the winner of Australian Idol. To compare the voices of the Australian contestants with any contestants voice from any 3 of the American idol would be insulting. Why can't Australia realise that we don't have to copy the rest of the world with a show like this if we don't have high standards. No way would Randy Jackson or Paula or Simon ever have let this guy get further than the first initial audition.  Also notice how the only people to have reviewed this less than average CD are mainly Australians, because no one else in America would have even heard of this 'singer'. Funny how Australians all critisize America yet to make it big in the music industry or any field of entertainment, all want to make it big in America because they really know that that is where it counts. Sorry Guy, I doubt you'd make it there!!  Don't buy this cd unless you like weak vocals and repetitive sounds.  
 I have cooked several recipes from this cookbook and found them all to be rather bland.  The cooking techniques, as well as the spicing, seems to be tailored for "American tastes" and this results in a less than satisfying result.  This is yet another "ethnic" cookbook which patronizes its readers with assumptions about how we cook, what we like, and what ingredients we have access to in the market 
 This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence ("We've got to get out of here," said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, "Sean, don't move!" instead of "Sean, dive for cover!!!" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile 
 Fans of the ABC-TV show "LOST" will probably be buying "Our Mutual Friend" in droves after having seen Desmond keeping it to be the "last book [I] ever [read]".  Since I did not have to buy it, having purchased a full set of Dickens years ago, I immediately set out to read it.  What a disappointment it was!  Dickens wrote it on an installment basis publishing it in a magazine over a 19 month period.  One cannot avoid a sneaking suspicion while reading it that it is, just a bit, perhaps, 'padded'.  Any good editor could have tightened it up at least 200 pages.   Dickens' work is melodrama, but some of it is just more overwrought than is compatible with good art.  As Oscar Wilde said of 'The Old Curiosity Shop', "I simply cannot read of the death of Little Nell without laughing."  'OMF' goes quickly down to this level of bathos and remains there to the last sentence.   Even worse is the ending.  Some endings just can't help but feel contrived; and Dickens, having gotten a large number of his characters into drastic positions, pulls so many strange- colored rabbits out of his hat that the reader simply feels cheated.  All of this may seem rather harsh from someone who was willing to shell out hundreds of dollars for "The Complete Oxford Illustrated Dickens" but I assure you that my only concern is for you, gentle reader.  Unless you are possessed of adequate time to read the whole of Dickens' oeuvre or are required to read "Our Mutual Friend", I would, instead, direct you to Dickens' far superior works:  'David Copperfield', 'Oliver Twist', 'Pickwick Papers'.    If you are looking for 'LOST' reading material, I would refer you to 'Watership Down' (Excellent), 'The Stand' (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature), 'The Dark Tower' series (by Stephen King, entertainment, not literature, and similar to 'Our Mutual Friend' possessed of a fatally flawed ending) or a review of philosophy like 'Locke, Rousseau and Hume'.

 I bought one of these because I thought it would make it easier to brew fresh ground coffee.  The beans are ground in a chamber with screen walls and then the coffee is brewed by dripping water right through the grinding chamber.  This works surprisingly well and is easy to clean since you can remove the grinding chamber and rinse it out in the sink.  The problem I had is that the the bottom and sides of the brewing chamber are all mesh so water ran through the beans to quickly making a weak cup of coffee.  Adding more coffee produced stronger coffee but it wasn't as full-flavored as a cup brewed through a paper filter in a standard coffee maker.  I ended ditching this product and going back to a standard coffee maker and a stand alone grinder.  If you like the complex flavors of a strong cup of coffee you'll probably end up doing the same 
 Parts of this book are worth reading.  For example, the author claims the influence of genetics/food is bi-directional.  I found this claim provocative. However, the rest of the book is uninspiring.   Finally, I was puzzled that the author never addressed the claim that our taste buds have memories.  (Whether he agreed or disagreed.)  In other words, what we eat in our earliest moments of life, has an extremely strong influence on what foods we like (and eat) for the rest of our lives.  This issue has been discussed in the science of nutrition and child rearing for many years now.  Susan Robert's "Feeding Your Child for Life Long Health" is a great book that incorporates this fact into an every day guide for mom and dad.  (I preferred Robert's first edition. 
 The authors of this book have not reviewed the latest research on nutrition.  Consequently, their book will not tell you more than you already know.  If you know that vegetables are good for you, you don't need  this book.  That is all you will learn 
 While I bought this book expecting an "engaging and erudite" insight into the biological causes behind human behavior, I ended up getting one scientist's narrow perspective.  Although the concept of the  book is promising, its goals would perhaps be better served in a  multi-author collection of essays.  This book, written by a researcher of  primate stress and its effects on their behavior, might be better titled  "What Baboons do in their Spare Time and Some Obscure Connections to  Humans" 
 this is a simple book showing what any militaristic tracking might show. could find this info in any of a dozen better sources. the only thing unique was the parts on human waste and body decomposition. not written very well 
 I must say that I do agree with the words of David Nightengale (Saint Paul, MN) that "If you want to know about accident prevention go to the System Safety Society".  The book talks a lot on tight coupling, or dependence, of different parts of systems during different states (DEPOSE, design, equipment, procedures, operators, supplies and materials, and environment), but it all remains very qualitative. Safety and reliability engineers prefer quantitative approaches, which are abundantly available in the area of systems reliability.   The author does have an attractive style of writing. Especially the presentation on dam failures (the Grand Teton, the Malpasset and Vaiont dam failures) was interesting to read. 
 it is full of mathmatical programing with no use. he makes you go in circles without giving you a real stuff.   
 Let me just say, I'm not a Seattle scenester, I'm not illiterate and I don't like the Lashes.  Sorry!  I found a copy of this EP in the used bin at my local record store so I thought I'd give it a spin - it was only a couple bucks.  Needless to say it's going back to the used bin.  Imitating the Strokes and the Killers is really played-out right now.  What's the point?  These songs are derivative with a capital "D".  The world doesn't need one more moody-looking band with perfectly styled hair doing an inferior version of what's already out there.  The music itself is almost passable but the lyrics are really DUMB!  It's like reading a 12 year-old girl's diary.  Even my friend said "It sounds like these guys are about one year too late."  The Lashes are so derivative and unoriginal I almost suspect they were "manufactured" to be popular.  Absolutely soulless.  
 The authors' thesis is correct. Yes, the real estate market, the stock market, and the dollar are part of one big bubble, and America will have gum on its face when it pops.  But the book is a repetitive, unimaginative bore.  Points are repeated again and again, ad nauseum.  After a couple of chapters, I concluded that the authors, motivated perhaps by fast money, slapped this project together, stretching what could have been a one-page magazine piece into a book.  "America's Bubble Economy" is largely bereft of original ideas.  The statistics and charts are simple-minded, the writing uninspired.  Several times, exasperated, I threw the book down and went to sleep.  But, almost certain that their thesis (though hardly original) is correct, I plodded on and finished it, like someone forced to take his medicine.  The only bright spot is Eric Janszen's engaging chapter on gold.  Recognizing that gold's value will be as a hedge against inflation, Janszen, slyly placing the words in quotes, says that investors can "make money" on gold.  That is, until, at some distant time, gold itself becomes a bubble and pops.  And so the book earns a single gold star, rather than none 
 Oh Lord!! Does anyone still read this?? I was a subscriber back in the early 70's,when it was a folded up, newspaper.By and large, Jann Wenner let people run it, that knew how to. It is now, and has been nothing more than an Ad choked,gossiping Teen slick.Right, like they are the ones with the money!! I wonder what they still pay Raoul Duke, to do??!! Ralph Gleason has to be turning over in the grave 
 "Dr." Shlain's work is little more than mental masturbation. Here's a clue Einstien: People live in the same world! There's NO way they could hear things from one another, is there? (sarcasm folks)  This psuedo-analytical babble is written under the false construct that people are isolated in history and spacetime.  Shlain should have thought that... Maybe Plank's revolutionary ideas sparked ideas in both art and physics helping lead to the Impessionist and later Cubist movements as well as Bohr's understanding of sub-atomic particle makeup and Einstein's theory of gravity.  Plus one could take a second, literally a second, and realize that artists were hearing of scientific breakthroughs and vice versa not to mention from the myriad of other human endeavors. Einstein's celebrity helped form the concepts of Italian Futurism and Marcell Duchamp's breaking of the then artistic "rules" led Feynman to establish his QED diagrams.  No doubt current breakthroughs will inspire future artists and scientists to achieve greatness in the same or different times. If the war in Iraq of today inspires an artist to write a play or paint an oil, then some engineer ten years from now is similarly inspired to create a quantum computer will Shlain use his same illogical reasoning to make another misguided and uneducated link between the two and show NO concept of the true historical context or common source(s)???  Nothing is mutually exclusive and many people can garner different ideas from a common source. Obviously Shlain is oblivious to this fact and this sophmoric literary attempt is just psdueo-intellectual tripe, a mental abortion if you will. Please, use your brain and read some history. Nothing is exclusive. I'm sure Kurt Vonnegutt and Stephen Hawkings both read the Iliad and both consciously or not have been influenced by it. Should I write a book on such a contrived piece of fiction linking Slaughterhouse 5 to A Brief History of Time? Hmmm.... 
 NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)!  Not liking the negro portrayal in GONE WITH THE WIND,Alice Randall therefore created her own version, a parody of the acclaimed southern classic.Therein lies the problem.  The trouble with parodies,it so intertwind with the original that it can be used as a sequel,a retelling or a new story with characters copied from the original but this time superior while degrading the original.So much so,readers begin to accept these false truth as the true truth.Not openly but in disguise, words like "what if" & "perhaps".Why?Because people always like scandals to famous chracters fiction or not.When that happen, a novel,even w/ the purest intent and purpose,gets butchered.  Here are some cases to prove my point & where the book failed:  1.THE PARODY/CONCEPT ITSELF-The whole purpose of this book is to show negroes aren't dumb and capable.If you read GWTW,as others call it"White-washed"&"Romantized",is in fact a love story.Plus Mitchell was trying to show how a civilization changes after a war,what better way to illustrate it than the old south?  But why portray negroes like that? Obviously these fools didn't see Aunt Pitty,Hugh Elsing or Ashley.Aren't they white,helpless,pathetic and idiots?  If you read GWTW, What about the courageousness&modesty of Pork,The industriousness &loyalty of Dilcey?What about Uncle Peter who single handly raised Charles&Melanie,who looked after and Protected Aunt Pitty?What about Rhett and Scarlett declaring Mammy as a smart old soul?Aren't these persons Negro and admirable traits?  2.MAMMY KILLING THE 3 SONS-In p.663 GWTW, a yankee tells Scarlett "do you think i can trust my babies to a negro?" She thought otherwise,and now Mammy kills Gerald's sons.Its thesame as saying negroes can't be trusted and they kill white babies and Randall was trying to show Negroes in a different light.This damages her&the book's credibility.Noble as her intent,but no good can come out of evil means.Its better to kill 10 people than 1 baby,as the saying goes.  3.GERALD/MAMMY-Check the background story of Ellen/Gerald.There can be no doubt of his fidelity.It takes a great deal of emotion for a person to get unhinged after a loved one's death.  4.CYNARA-She is an exact copy of Scarlett even their ages are thesame but this time she smart,beautiful,brown,a good mother compared to Scarlett.She even has Scarlett's strength & Rhett even prefers her.Ridiculous!if Rhett likers her than Scarlett he would've married her instead,or divorce scarlett after he have is way with her,Rhett boast of being ill-bred so his rep. wont matter.Why this nonesense of mistress and after death marriage?  The book,despite being well-written,feels like a parasite after reading created by a first-time author who wants instant fame,fortune making others accept and embrace that her work is better while destroying others hard work. If you want a book about the attrocities of slavery then buy UNCLE TOM's CABIN which is BETTER than this one.  NOTE: MY TOPIC IS ABOUT THE WIND DONE GONE AND NOT SLAVERY(which I hate)! 
 Was not what I expected. It does not spend enough time on any particular area of the body to really work it 
 My experience has been similar to that of other reviewers. The one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro. My two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when I checked her in the middle of the night. Honestly, the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they didn't move their arms... so perhaps the designers had no children of their own 
 I was expecting a lot more out of this than I got. The entire Northtown side of the cd is lousy, with maybe one or 2 good songs. The Westside tracks arent much better but they do have La Clicka, Redrum Inc., and of course Doomsday. I would say dont buy this unless you collect cd's (like I do), because if you dont you will just end up getting rid of it. Instead of this buy anyone of the Doomsday albums expecially Filthy, it's classick 
  First of all I think the concept is great however the safety bobber doesn't open and after about a dozen casts the reel fell apart. If you're looking for something that shoots, buy a rocket rocket not this rocket fishing rod and save some money. Shame on you Roland Martin for sponsoring such a piece of garbage. Don't expect to catch fish with this it is simply a novelty item 
 I bought this book because I really do believe that U2 represent something very significant in terms of spirituality. I hoped the book would be as inspiring as U2 themselves or at least partly so. How wrong I was. This random collection of sermons feels like I'm stuck in high school english class listening to person after person rattle off speech after speech, wishing they were anywhere else but here. There is not a shred of revelation or conviction in any one of them. I kept reading hoping it would get better but it didn't. I'm very relieved that the people offering up these sermons are not preaching in my church. This is textbook preaching 101. Powerless and impoverished 
 I love movies. I hate this one.  Every melodramatic gimmick known to 1970s TV movies is packed in tight.  My favorite one is when one of the kids gets free long enough to pick up the gun, but is just too emotional to shoot his captor. The captor is yelling "Shoot me! Come on!" But he just can't. He's too busy hamming up the whimpering. Like the damsel running from the slow-moving monster and then she breaks a heel. Wouldn't ya know!  If you liked Mickey Rourke in "Diner" I suggest you don't spoil it for yourself 
 Streisand is spiritual? That is the biggest laugh yet! Listening to this one will put you in a early grave. Yuck 
 Mr. Blum has arguably written the worst account of a war in history.  Amazingly, he chooses to focus on the young Israeli couple torn apart by the war (of course, the whole nation's citizenery were torn apart as well), while completely ignoring the major players in the world (US, Soviets, etc.)  It is as if he was just trying to fill up the pages of the book while doing no research at the expense of the reader.  The great Six Day War by Michael Orin also delves into the incredibly important diplomatic efforts surrounding that war.  No war book can overlook the importance of "world opinion" at the time, but this one does. Admittedly, the Israeli couple had a very interesting story to tell, but it adds nothing to the history of the conflict and the story finishes with a very incomplete conclusion on the two characters.  In contrast, many other great tomes (my favorite thus far is The Two O'Clock War by Walter Boyne) highlight the dire situation that Israel faced, and the necessary US airlift that arguably saved the country.  Also, Mr. Boyne discusses the many lessons learned by the Arab nations (mostly Egypt) and its effect on the Yom Kippur War.   Mr. Blum seems to have an axe to grind on the very controversial general and now Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.  It is well known that he was a "rebel" in both the best and worst meaning of the word, but Blum seems to obsess over the negative aspects and the government's repeated attempts to relieve him of his command.  Again, Mr. Boyne addresses this topic more fairly, pointing out that Sharon's soldiers loved, admired, and trusted him, and that his daring was often beneficial militarily.  Truly, a double edged sword. Blum makes no mention of Hosni Mubarak's importance in the conflict.  Of course, the US "ally" (and recipient of billions in aid while his state controlled media incites hatred of Jews/Christians/etc.) and strongman, has ruled Egypt under "emergency" rule for over 20 years (since open to democracy by Condi & George...don't deny leftists!).  His later importance to Egypt is formed partially during the conflict. I could go on, but suffice it to say that any other book you read on this amazing moment in world history would be better written and more informative than the Eve of Destruction. 
 Now, don't get me wrong; I actually liked Ryan Cabrera's first album. I don't know if his popularity stemmed from his then relationship with Ashlee Simpson or from good ol' TRL airplay or what, but at any rate, Take It All Away was still pretty good. But I can't say the same for his follow-up, You Stand Watching.  I think Kool Fool described Ryan's vocal very accurately. Truthfully, Ryan's voice has always been kind of whiny, but now it's gotten to the point that it's hard to even tolerate (see especially the first two tracks: "From the Start" and "Hit Me With Your Light"). That pieced with the below-average lyrics makes for a bad combination. Ryan co-wrote all the tracks himself this time around: bad move. The album is 37 minutes long, and it feels like that's how long it took to write the songs. This is best illustrated on the single "Photo", which doesn't really go anywhere.  I actually thought "Our Story" was pretty listenable until he started to ask things like, "Is there anyone out there who'll love me?" And nothing else is very impressive either. Sorry, Ryan; while I did defend your first album, You Stand Watching is an album I can't stand hearing.  Anthony Ruper 
 Okay, this book LOOKED good from the description.  That's about all I've got.  Once I started reading it, I realized that it was a collection of icky horror stories that were really more disturbing and likely to cause a nightmare than I'm comfortable with.  If that's the kind of thing that you're into, then...would you like my copy??  ;- 
 The books are getting muddled down.  It truly is a bad soap opera.  A place where women dont have enough respect for themselves to choose there own man. Where men fight like animals where cunning means will the dragon sword stike true or not.  When a writer spends 3 pages. 2 or was it 3 times in his book to repeat the exact same  words about how people dress. The question is Jordan writing these books on content or how much money he gets per page? 
 I too had this book for a college 19th century art course. Most of the movements were not new to me and I dearly love most art of the period. But for anyone new to it this will be an incredibly boring read, too much bogged down in marxism and political correctness. Eisenman; a self-professed "Marxist-Art Historian" seems unable to speak of any movement without making it into classs warfare or accusing artists of being sexist or rascist, while completely ingnoring the historical context. As with many art history surveys Eisenman also suffers the delusion that there is something inherently wrong with academic art and that the only worthwhile art of the 19th century was made in France 
 I received my book a week before the class was over, luckily the local library was more reliable. Additionally they don't give refunds, maybe it's because they know there service sucks and would lose a lot of money......hmmmmm 
 THE FIRST 60 OR SO PAGES ARE JUST AWFUL. JOHN KEEGAN ARGUES THAT WAR IS NOT THE CONTINUATION OF POLITICS RATHER THE RESULT OF CULTURAL DRIVES. THAT MAY WELL HAVE BEEN SO IN HISTORICAL TIMES, BUT IS HARDLY SO TODAY. HE UNFORTUNATELY TRIES TO EXPLAIN AGGRESSION AND VIOLENCE FROM A BIOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVE AND IS NOT ONLY DATED, HE'S FLAT WRONG. THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE, I.E., CLAIMING THE U.S. ABANDONED THE DRAFT AFTER WW II AND DIDN'T USE IT AGAIN UNTIL THE 60'S. WRONG AGAIN! WHAT IS INTERESTING IS THAT KEEGAN'S VERY VIEWS ARE SO MUCH A CONTINUATION OF BRITISH POLITICAL THINKING. NOT A GREAT BOOK AT ALL 
 It seems alot of Euro power metal bands that started off promisingly have quickly run aground. bands like Nocturnal Rites and Edguy have taken to treading the same tired waters, having seemingly lost the spark of their earlier albums. Add Sonata Arctica to that list. If anything, SA lost a step with this release, which sounds completely uninspired. They were showing signs of fatigue on their previous album (Winterheart's Guild) but it at least kept pace w/ the first 2 albums. If you're a total SA fanboy, you'll be fine with this album, but if you're an older power metal fan who's tired of hearing bands just re-make the same album every year, this is definitely not the one for you; i'd recommend trying Dragonforce instead (no, they're not all that original either, but they play with 100%  more balls and conviction than what you'll hear on Reckoning Night 
 I was very hopeful that this printer would meet my needs.  The printer worked fine with my 1GB SD card, and also when I connected my PictBridge-compatible camera.  (I should mention that the dark tones in the printer appeared very dark.)  However I also just bought a couple of 2GB SanDisk Ultra II cards.  The printer doesn't recognize these cards when inserted into the appropriate slot - it gives an error message that the card could not be recognized.  I contacted HP support and they verified indeed that the printer does not support SD cards larger than 1 GB.  I'm sorry that I'll have to return the printer 
 I had the same problem described by R. Nielsen.  The gauge would not take a new reading after I pressed the release valve to let air out.  It only took a new reading if it was removed from the tire completely and reconnected.  I called the manufacturer, who told me that it sounded like a problem and that I should return the gauge to them for a replacement.  I returned it to Amazon as defective and got a new one with the same problem.  I contacted the manufacturer again and they again asked me to send the gauge in for a replacement.  I have sent the gauge to the manufacturer at my expense.  The second replacement also had the problem.  Customer service told me that they had sent the second replacement from the wrong batch/crate.  Six weeks later (November 27th) I received a properly functioning gauge.  So it seems that a properly manufactured example of this gauge really does work properly.  There was just a very large run of defective ones.  At this point, I would give this item 3 stars: 4 for performance and price, minus one for the hassle involved in getting one that isn't defective.  If yours is defective, you should contact Accutire customer service and let them know: 973-402-4240.  
 I seriously didn't like it. It is definetly not for the young and weak hearted. The characters were not likeable and the fact that everything was sexual was not exactly a positive feature. It sickened me, and i really felt bad after finishing it. Truly skip this book, it's not worthwhile, please i beg of you don't read it. I'm incredibly disappointed in Richard Peck in this one 
 The quality of this cable is fine, but it doesn't give you access to the power pins that are in the Garmin interface.  Get the cable that does power and data instead...  or if you're a hardware geek, then make your own with the stuff from purple open projects (pfranc.com 
 I just received this product after much research, and I am really disappointed with it's quality. The mattres is so stiff and hard especially for a baby, and the sheets provided are like an emory board, scratchy and stiff. My baby is too long for this, so her feet fall off the edge of the mattres. I just thought it would be much better than this. Looks like I will be returning it.  My daughter is now sleeping in her bouncy chair, tied down at the back to reduce the bounce and with a fluffy pillow underneath it to also reduce the bounce 
 After reading Bernstein's Capital Ideas, a cheerleading book for lognormal finance theory, which gushes over heroes, I had high expectations for Jacobs' criticism Bernstein's viewpoint. But Jacobs' sole argument  seems  to be that portfolio insurance was a bad idea, and he repeats it too often.  Many chapters are simply too repetitive and were written as if they'd been  cut and pasted from different badly-written review articles. Even though  the book is post-LTCM (post 10/98) most of the book is taken by with  attacking of LOR's pre-1987 idea of portfolio insurance, while the far more  fascinating and more recent case of LTCM and the near collapse of the  global finance system is hardly discussed. I recommend instead "The  Vandal's Crown" and "Inventing Money" 
 I was sadly disappointed to find I did not like this book at all after all the glowing reviews it received here.  The characters were flat and the author gave me no reason to care about any of them.  Everything was very 2 dimensional for me.  I bought the book as a gift based on the reviews here, then a copy for myself so I could get in on the fun.  I forced myself through half the book before I just tossed it and promised my father a replacement - something I'd read already and knew he would enjoy.  But that's just my opinion - obviously not shared by many 
 Sam is shocked when her husband decides he wants to divorce, even though she knew they had been growing apart for some time.  The news crushes her, and she deals with it by going to Tiffany's and spending $12,00.00 on things she doesn't really want.  Her husband's response is mild exasperation and a warning that he's moved most of the money out of the checking account where it will be safe.  Are you kidding me?  Are these supposed to be real people acting this way?  What follows is a series of events of unbelievable good luck as Sam alternates between feeling sorry for herself and acting absolutely crazy in a quest to be the perfect housewife and mother. A good example of the latter is when she cooks an entire Thanksgiving dinner, including a twenty-one pound turkey and several pies, although she is spending the day entirely alone.  Despite her erratic behavior, Sam manages to find the perfect woman to move in with her--a grandmotherly woman who helps her recover from her heartache.  Sam also begins a series of temp jobs and meets a brilliant and sweet man who loves her enough to totally change himself for her.  Throughout everything, Sam's husband continues to support her financially.  They don't fight over their son and her husband is even tolerant of Sam's crazy phone calls.  If this is what divorced life is like, I'm surprised more women don't go for it.   
 I am quite amazed that this novel has an average rating of 4 stars. I had to FORCE myself to complete this book because I could only read about 10 pages at a time before being utterly bored.   I believe the book started with a good premise: a boy who can "read" photographs. If the author had just stuck with that idea and developed it a bit more, the book could have been decent. However, the author introduced all sorts of lame plot elements and characters, all the way to the end. It was as if she didn't plan the story and just sort of made it up as she went along. In addition, the character development was shallow. I really could have cared less if any of them died. The only remotely interesting character for me was Uncle Paton.   Please avoid this book. It's drivel, utter drivel.  
 Do not buy at this price. Ridiculous!!!  Just bought this car on ebay for 8.99.  And bought another very rare one("Mr The King") for $10.00.  These sellers are nuts! 
 Jill McCorkle seems to be trying too hard to be unique and quirky just for the sake of being "original." I was attracted to this book because I like fiction written from the point of view of many characters, but "Carolina Moon" was an amalgam of too many different styles that just wouldn't blend. We have letters, we have third person narration, and we have first person narration in the form of an annoying young woman talking to a tape recorder diary. Too much.  This last narration bothered me because the woman didn't sound like she was talking to a tape recorder - the voice sounds more like a written voice. For example, she barely distinguishes who's speaking, which is fine on the page where you can see indents and paragraphs and quotation marks, but as a spoken voice it didn't work. She didn't sound like a real person. The point of having someone tell his or her story through a tape recorder diary is to capture his/her voice more naturally. McCorkle just tells the story this way because it's "neat." The character doesn't sound any different from any of the other characters - and her story is pointless and contributes nothing to the plot or sublot or second subplot.  Quee was just plain annoying. She's an old, quirky prostitute medicine woman who collects pictures of people she doesn't know and makes stories up about them. She was quirky and had a quirky perspective on morals, so we're supposed to like her. I hated her. I'm tired of fiction about crazy, quirky people trying to force their agendas down our throats. The best novel I've read about a quirky person was "A Separate Peace" because the narrator in that novel gets just as annoyed at the quirky character as the reader. (And he pushes him out of a tree.) Read that book instead.  I think McCorkle may just have been suffering from some quirkiness herself when she wrote this book. The characters are flat and uninteresting, and the stories are bland. There's no reason for the unnamed woman to drop letters to her dead lover in the mailbox except to advance the story. And the only purpose the mailman has is to read the letters to us. The characters are more like the author's pawns than real people. The book didn't really seem to be about anything, and the ending was unbelievable (in a bad way, not a good way). I was surprised because McCorkle is usually a very good character writer. Her short story "Intervention" is a marvelous story about a woman torn between her alcoholic husband and her children, who wish to have an intervention. Great character in that story. I'd recommend reading McCorkle's short stories instead of "Carolina Moon." 
 Without doubt the book is well written and the authors do an amazing job of using "smoke and mirrors" to convince readers that their analysis of the criminal justice system is true and factual. However, I have never seen a more perfect example of an author intentionally manipulating data and statistics to support his or her opinion.   Besides the clear political bias of the author, there are even a number of blatant factual errors. For example, look hard enough and you will find that the same exact bar graph is erroneously used twice in the book for two entirely different studies.   This is NOT a history book. Nor should it be used as such. It has a very clear purpose and that is to demonize conservatives and those who are "tough on crime" 
 I was very much looking forward to reading this. I'm approaching my 40th birthday, and wanted to hear how others had dealt with this transition. In all fairness, Ms. Braun does interview many women on their transitions. However, the language is superificial, sometimes to the point of being annoyingly "cutesy". For example her term "Fertile Void" which is defined once, is used as a critical thread throughout the work, as though it's a sociological phenomena. If the book had been written about that term specifically, maybe things could have been interesting.  OK, there is a period of time where one doesn't know which path to take, but I hate labels, especially cute ones, especially when applied to grown-up women facing serious challenges. I need to lead myself into new terrain, and find my own voice, and I don't need cheerleading and labels. I found the "rah-rah" attitude really lame. Worse still, the term "F-You Fifties"...I'm sorry, but I got over that language a long, long time ago. I don't think it's amusing.  One of the "success stories" was from a woman who, when she lights up her joints (marijuana) today, has much more pleasant trips. Frankly I felt offended and patronized, and I am no prude...I grew up on Ms. magazine, I went to a Seven Sister school, and I'm from NYC.  I was truly expecting More, as in that wonderful magazine for which Ms. Braun works.. 
 I haven't read a Picoult book in a while because her formula was bothering me but I saw this in the airport and decided it would be a easy yet entertaining read for the tedious 3 hour journey.  It was entertaining to the extent that I finished it. Unfortunately - it was still formulaic and completely predictable.  Elements that I liked:   - Rape is very rarely easy to sort out and date rape cases involving drugs, ex-boyfriends and alcohol are especially difficult. The confusion and obfuscation that Picoult writes (whether that was her intention or just poor writing) surrounding the issue can be representative of an actual rape.    - Teenagers are notoriously melodramatic and self pitying and Trixie, though a little over the top, seemed like a typical teenager... the reaction of other students at her school to the rape and Trixie also seem plausible.   - I liked the graphic novel. The melodramatic aspects are typical of the genre and it was a great way to try and illustrate Daniel. The hidden word bit - hokey.   - I liked learning about the native cultures in Alaska. I would like to read a whole book that takes place there and explores the themes though maybe not by Picoult.   - I liked the idiot's guide to Dante that was incorporated into the book.  Things I didn't like:   - Picoult tries to incorporate too much into this book and thus wasn't able to fully develop it all. Though I liked the native Alaskan bit, it was too jumbled and it didn't really add to the plot. Like another reviewer I wasn't left with the impression that Daniel's haunted past resurfaced. I was expecting a lot more. Murder? That's too much to add to this already overburdened plot.   We lose threads here and there like Daniel's career and the wife's affair - he just disappears after his admission. Cutting is a very real phenomena for many young women and Jodi doesn't explain or develop it.  I don't know that it was at all believable. Could the myopic Trixie have had the wherewithal to make it to Alaska when she could barely see beyond her own break-up and tried to commit suicide multiple times?  The cop, the DNA analyst, the lawyers, the parents, the twist - I've seen them all before in Jodi's other books... it's part of her formula.  I wonder what would happen if Jodi spent maybe three or four years researching a novel and devoting time to its plot. She could excel in character development and careful analysis of difficult topics. I feel like this novel writing machine is doing herself, her readers and literature a disservice 
 When someone like Gerd Ludemann publishes with Prometheus Press, take it as meaning, "I knew darned well my thesis would never survive peer review." Ludemann is very well able to construct historical fantasies without documentation in order to explain away recorded history that has all of the documentation. The Resurrection of Christ is mostly an extended exercise in this sort of literary snowblowing, as Ludemann finds conspiracy to convert you under nearly every turn of phrase.  Thus for example, Paul includes himself in the list of 1 Cor. 15 "to defend his apostolic authority" [41]. That's not quite true, though; from a Greco-Roman rhetorical standpoint, Paul's self-inclusion is part of a narratio, in which a self-testimony that would be expected to round off the feature. As well, assertions of fact are under suspicion merely for having an "apologetic ring" -- so does any claim of truth, for that matter; even that Gerd Ludemann has a Ph. D. If he happens to assert this, should we immediately suspect that he doesn't actually have one, and that because he is "defending his authority" we ought to be suspicious that a) someone else questions it, and b) they may be right? Critics like Ludemann we suspect would have a serious issue with such a judgmental indictment upon their characters, but they have no problem accusing Biblical authors of the same thing.  Ludemann's book shows great deficiencies in terms of being aware of current scholarship. His claim that Matthew stressed the "newness and cleanliness" of Jesus; burial cloth "to convince his audience of Jesus' uniqueness" [53] and to stave off the implication of a dishonorable burial fails on multiple points: 1) he obviously has not read McCane's work showing in effect that a pedantic reference to a clean cloth, as he supposes, is going to in any sense convince anyone that Jesus' burial was not shameful; 2) he has failed to recognize that the Gospels were written for and to Christians, so that Matthew is not trying to and does not have to "convince" anyone of anything in terms of Jesus being unique; 3) it's just plain paranoid; one may as well argue that Matthew stresses a linen cloth as a secret slam against producers of other fabrics. He's also missing McCane in his treatment of Jesus' burial by Joseph [62]. Otherwise, there's little in the way of quality explanation: A text that reports miracles is automatically unhistorical, no further explanation needed; words of Jesus must be inauthentic because they can be "explained by [an author's] theological purpose" [112](so can we say Ludemann didn't write his book, because what is in it serves his theological purpose?).  Ludemann is also not entirely above the occassional temper tantrum. He has particular scorn for N. T. Wright and his book The Resurrection of the Son of God, a huge volume he barely touches; his frustration with being unable to address Wright in detail is clear in that only Ludemann could decipher from Wright's measured prose against historical revisionism a "bitter polemic" of any sort [37]. Who is indeed bitter here is shown in that Ludemann insults Wright by preferring to rebut him with Thomas Paine (!), and addresses him snidely in the first person [200]. (His accusation of inconsistency by Wright is confused: Ludemann is apparently ticked particuarly because Wright tagged him for assuming ancient people were too stupid to know that dead people did not ordinarily rise. But as a reply, he only insults Wright for reaching "theological" conclusions, and hoists a vague spectre of "goodbye scholarship" when miracle claims are admitted, which is nothing but the same begged question of naturalism that Wright's point implicitly refutes!)  Ludemann's crowning glory is his attempt to reconstruct how resurrection belief came to the apostles, but here he fails most conspicuously, as his theories would never work in the social world of the NT. A mourning Peter would never think a vision of Jesus was Jesus himself, but Jesus' guardian angel (a twin brother, as it were); and he would never think that this Jesus, even if Jesus, was resurrected (as that was not expected until judgment). The same Peter would also not experience "guilt" [166] but shame. His idea of Paul as a man with a "Christ complex" who always had to be number one is refuted by the ancient understanding of honor as a limited good. Thus Ludemann's effort to create a "chain reaction" [173] scenario fails from the very first and most critical links. His rebuttal as well to the opportunity of authorities to open or point to the empty tomb [181] doesn't hold water:     1. He points to the "rapid decay of flesh" in Palestine's climate. But this in itself would not keep authorities from pointing to the tomb, and making the claim that Jesus' body was within; as it is, the lack of even this shows that they could not make such a claim, for the tomb was empty.    2. His claim that the "place of burial was unknown" is a farce, for there is no way the location of Joseph's tomb could be unknown (and it is a counsel of despair to suggest that Joseph, or the burial in his tomb, is not historical, especially after McCane)    3. And, a "Disneyland Palestine" objection that fails to realize that Jews were not typically inclined to verenate persons and places as described.   So it is that Ludemann grinds out more of the same we have come to expect. It's a valiant attempt, but in the end, nothing but invention of history to explain away history 
 This book is absolutely flawed in its arguements.  Schlesinger ignores the context of the times; he ignores basic truths; he is jaded in his outlook.  By all accts., Mr. Schlesinger is a New Deal Democrat who tries to firmly tie in the New Deal Democrats into the Democrats of old.  This is not feasible as the Democrats of old and the New Deal Democrats had differing perspectives and ideals.  He reaches and stretches with the intent of the Democrats in the Age of Jackson, that they were always for the laboring classes, when this is not the case, especially in Southern Democrats who were aristocratic in nature and outlook.  They could not comprehend the plight of the ordinary laborer, as their world view was quite skewed.  Further, divisions that were slowly emerging between Northern and Southern Democrats, primarily over the slavery issue, are discounted and Schlesinger merely goes back to his jaded perspective that the Democrats were the champions of the common people.  Schlesinger imposes his own view of politics and parties on politicians from the Age of Jackson.  There are other works out there that are 100 times better on the Age of Jackson that this work, such as The House Divides: The Age of Jackson and Lincoln, from the War of 1812 to the Civil War edited by Paul Wellman and Lewis Gannett or The Era of Good Feelings and the Age of Jackson, 1816-1841 by Robert Remini.  However, I will give the man credit where it is due, he does his research.  Pity he doesn't know what to do with it 
 The application of the Golden Rule to our everyday lives is something that we can all agree is good.  John Maxwell does a good job or defining the golden rule, its worldwide acceptance, and how we can apply it to our everyday.  It was more like a walk down memory lane; to a time when a teacher or mentor first explained the concept to us.  However I do have a few concerns with Mr. Maxwell's book.  First there might need to be a better job at researching Fletcher thoughts on Relativism...in his book he labels Fletcher as the father of mordern day Realativism...quoting (or rather misquoting) Fletcher's statement that love can justify anything.  I am in not postition to defend Fletcher, for I am not that familiar with his work, however he does not just use the term love.  Rather he uses the term Agape Love, coming from the ancient Greek...the highest and purest form of love...one that God would have for us, a term any minister or pastor of the Christian Faith would know very well.  Second after page 86 the book get repediative and seems to get off track.  This links to my last issue with the book and why it gets a bit off track, as it turns into an advertisement for Mr. Maxwell's corporation, the last several pages are nothing but adverstisements asking you to visit their web site for free character quiz and then taking you down a road of Buy...buy...buy our products.  Not what I expected and was somewhat disappointed.  In short taking some know concepts, putting a somewhat of a new spin on them and then publishing to add another book to the list of those authored.  Part of the disappointment is that I know this book could be better 
 Here's a quick summary of the book--Everything that google does is wonderful and google has changed the world as we know it. Come on. How about a little more impartiality. How about going more into privacy and IP issues? I gave it 2 stars instead of 1, but I would not recommend buying it 
 I was dissappointed to see that when I got the product there were old worn out batteries inside and I then had to go out and purchase an adapter and spend MORE money.  The keyboard works fine now but that was unacceptable for me to have had to do that.  I was very surprised by this from Amazon since I have had such good experiences so far 
 In my only other review of a Coben book('Gone For Good') I was concerned that he was relying too much on formulaic plots(guy loses girl, goes through hell, uncovers 'deep, dark, secret', and big plot twist at the end reveals all.) Unfortunately, every one of those characteristics is present in 'TNO', and the result is a terrible novel! It's not even good enough to be classed as a 'fun junk food' read. The plot is full of idiotic developments that are meant to be 'surprises', and ridiculously convoluted action/chase scenes. Yet another aspiring screenplay masquerading as a book. I won't even attempt to explain the plot. I suppose the only good thing I can say about the story is it didn't turn out to be another hokey 'serial killer' drama, after all...though that would have been an improvement! There are far too many cases of characters 'keeping secrets' and double-crossing each other...but the 'big secret' revealed at the end is the worst of all, destroying the slim chance that the reader might actually salvage something from this train-wreck.Plenty of other readers have already commented on the ridiculous supporting cast, which seems to be a Coben trademark, alongside his New York settings and poor plotting, so I'll skip them, and hope 'Hester' doesn't mind!  Read if you're a Coben fan, skip if you actually like stories that make sense and lead somewhere 
 I never received this book. I'm hoping it was overlooked and will be sent soon 
 I can't understand the good reviews given by others to this movie. Frankly, I thought it was a dog.  Not to say that it had no redeeming features - the friendship between the young girl and the lawn man was endearing, if improbable. And the girl herself was a real sweetie, and a good actress - perfect for the part. In fact, the acting all around was admirable.  But the script! Yikes! Not a single character in the whole movie - with the partial exceptions of the two protagonists - had any motivation for anything they did. People acting awkward or mean (in fact, just about everyone in the movie other than said two was mean), or spiteful, or stupid, for no reason at all!   It seems as though somehow, the movie could have been good, but didn't make it. Call it almost watchable.  I came away from Lawn Dogs (Yawn Dogs?) feeling not at all enriched. Puzzled, perhaps, at why anyone would make such a movie. Well, there was that admirable, unlikely friendship. But that was all.  Pass this one by 
 The story was the most silly and childish book that I ever read from this writer. Most dissapointed for a Danielle Steel novel. I had never had a book from Danielle Steel that I did not love but this one I don't know what else to say, bad, bad, bad 
 Although this book makes some good points it really isn't for all service business. I own a salon and I did every single exercise. A Lot of the questions being asked are reworded over and over. Then you ask yourself, didn't I just answer that. I do have a target market and I do have educational events in my salon. I cannot afford to have a web site done and that is not my expertise to DYI. As for writing a book geared towards my clients, what would I write about that someone would pay for and give them real help? I already have relationships with all my clients and I more than keep in touch. There just didn't seem to be any real marketing advice for service businesses. It seamed to me that it was only trying to get people to buy his seminars. I am done with these types of books that promote their products. The only thing I do agree with is that you should never work with people you don't hit it off with just to make a buck. It will be worse than if you didn't have any clients. Other than that I think that "401 Ways to Promote and Market your Business" does a much better job and isn't asking you to buy more things to make him rich. The rich get richer while the poor get poorer. Micheal Port and his staff is banking on it 
 I didn't expect too much for the price but I was really disappointed with the quality.The cover is very flimsy and the book is larger than I expected. I guess you get what you pay for 
 Trisha Malcolm is the editor for this book and series but I think something happened to this one as usually the quality is pretty good on this series. First of all, many of the yarns used are very expensive like Trendsetter yarns. Second: since when are baskets considered bags?  There's nothing here I want to make but check out the "Hooked bags" by Margaret Hubert which I gave 5 stars.  So of the 22 bags only 20 are original here. You'll find a felted laptop bag and a yoga bag here and a freeform bag which calls for a large variety of hard to find materials. Hubert does have two nice clutches here but the yarns are fancier than what she used in her own book.  
 This is another in a long history of books written by blind men describing the elephant's trunk. Other great books and essays in this tradition include "Free to Choose" by Milton and Rose Friedman, "The Law" by Frederick Bastiat, and "Economics in One Lesson" by Henry Hazlitt. All these books are quite good at describing the trunk (or a tree), but miss the elephant (or the woods) in the process.  For what it covers, it is a fine book.  However, Sowell forgets to apply all of his principles to the most influential business organization in the market, the corporation. The corporation has the perpetual life, limited liability and personhood. The qualities of limited liability and personhood could not be reproduced without government intervention in the market. Yet, limited liability and personhood are ignored so that he can focus on rent control or price controls. Are rent controls really more important to the economy than a corporation?  Before the libertarians and conservatives that are reading this get their [...] bunched over a corporation being able to be created without government intervention, think about a third party being hurt by a corporate action. If a corporation mistakenly dumps toxic waste on land that you own then goes out of business, who is responsible? Answer: No one. You made no contract with the offending corporation, neither explicitly nor implicitly. You are left paying for the mistake that others made because the government granted limited liability (or limited irresponsibility) to corporate investors.  Is limited liability so trivial that it can be ignored? If yes, then let's get rid if it. No more limited liability. If no, why doesn't Sowell explore the unintended consequences of this government intervention?  I suggest you take Sowell's advice and think about the secondary and tertiary consequences of corporate limited liability and personhood. Now that could make a good book. Does limited liability change incentives? Does the gathering of capital through limited liability have an impact on political campaigns and lobbying (and through lobbying, changes in the law)?  This book is just more stuff, on a pile of stuff that was better written 
 Maybe if you live in Florida you can make sense of these maps.  There are no cities on them.  If you're not from Florida, like me, they make no sense at all.  Also, the distances he lists are sometimes self-contradictory.  One of the maps shows the Pacific ocean.  Last time I checked Florida is not near the Pacific.  If this were the only fault with this book, it would be one thing, but I think it is just symbolic of the general quality of this book.  I have only paddled on one of these rivers, which he lists as good paddling, but it is actually choked with fallen trees - you have to portage about every fifty feet.    If you want to know where you can paddle near some city in Florida this book is useless.  You can't figure out what listed rivers are near that city.  Even if you can figure out where these rivers are, he doesn't give you enough information to know which one you want to paddle on.  
 I recently saw this book on the bargain bin.  This book was pure garbage, by two arrogant 20-somethings in clown suits.  Basically they are saying valuations don't matter.  Since they wrote the book, it has been prooven that their philosophy, approached over the long term, produces some great damaging losses.  The book may be useful during the next bubble, which if history serves, will occur well after these clowns pass on to the big three-ring circus in the sky.  To the dungeon with these two knaves 
 With great anticipation and relish i awaited this accumulation of the works of probably one of the greatest playwrites of the 20th century. Having seen a short promotional film of the project, my eagerness was picqued.But, alas, flash, star-worship and diminished expectations rule once again in this travesty. Having actually not even been able to sit through the Endgame of this set, and having also seen the foolish, punk-flash version of Breath, and the unsympathetic and misunderstood, braindead interpretation of Not I, i am so appalled i nearly whipped this weighty and overly expensive set, frisbee-like,out the window. It never ceases to amaze how so much star power can do so much damage. Remember the Broadway travesty of Godot a few years ago with Robin Williams? So, Engame is a beautiful performance. all the Gaelic colloquial nuance of Beckett's language,perfectly understood and delivered in a heightened naturalism that is a joy to behold. The only problem is, one can NOT behold it because of the hack direction. Done in obsessively Television Direction School multi-camera work, anytime a charecter speaks or moves he is held in extreme talking-head close-up. next actor speaks, close up for him, then back to the other actor and so on and so on until the stomach of the viewer churns from this sea-sick demntia of camera close-ups,reaction shots, two shots and flashing long shots. So you don't have a play, or a film, you end up with a Television show of utter convention and utter unwatchability. i suggest people stay away from this possibly well-intentioned but decadent and unwatchable and expensive lump of Beckett Meets Hollywood by way of London. 
 Had to stop about 1/4 of the way through it and give it away 
 The scale is off by 18 pounds.  I compared it twice to my weight when I went to my doctor.  It's fine if you are willing to do a little math every time you weigh yourself 
 24-Hour Party People is a mocumentary at the lowest rung (if Best In Show was not enough) that tries at many times to be funny but is mostly in poor taste. The British scene in the 1980's was influential and at the height of the 2nd Brit wave, and Michael Winterbottom could have exposed the goings-on in a much better way.   My main issue with this film was it's attempts at being funny in a hip-Britster fashion that falls flat constantly since the issues occurring are very serious. The dialogue is difficult to follow especially since most of it is meaningless anyway, and the film never really follows it's premise as much as it should: the rise of Factory. I did really enjoy the Joy Division segments, though, even if exploiting Ian Curtis's death was slightly in poor taste.   Unless you're a fan of the Brit explosion of the post-punk era, and an extreme fan at that, I could not recommend this film. It's not even greatly educational for music lovers and at times very difficult to get into. 
 The movie is vulgar and not meant for children.  It is a typical Adam Sandler movie, with foul language and raunchy humor.  Not enjoyable at all.  
 The Cobra Event is a jarring book, not because of the plausibility of the plot nor because it goes into excruciating pains to describe dead boies and their subsequent autopsies, but because there are so many errors on its pages. Worse, there are whole chapters devoted to nothing that advances the plot or helps me undersatand the story better; pages and pages of filler - it was like reading a doughnut.  Among the worst are:  --Changing verb tenses in the middle of a paragraph. I have no idea why a paragraph that starts with the past perfect tense suddenly switches to the present tense in the second sentence. And it didn't happen just once.  --Using "you" all the time. The book has this very condescending, accusatory tone when it directly addresses me, as though it knows what I know and don't know.  --Maxing out the filler potential. I know that detail helps to make stories seem authentic, but really, taking a paragraph to explain the history of Katz's Delicatessan is superfluous.  Argh 
 After this percolator stopped working, we were instructed to send it to Dulalit's service center for repair (Electra Craft, Inc.)  Customer service at the repair center was very unprofessional -- they would tell us the package was shipping out to us, and nothing would arrive.  It was only after persistent calling that they finally shipped the percolator to us and it arrived in worse condition.  It took them four months to return the percolator to us.  They refused to replace the percolator because we owned it for more than 30 days.  Amazon was very helpful and understanding and assisted us with a refund.    We unfortunately own two of these percolators and when the lid broke on the second one, I had to contact Electra Craft, again.  They were able to provide the part, a simple stainless steel lid, for $25.00 plus shipping and handling!  I'm sure their other replacement parts are overpriced as well 
 This bible as far as the commentary goes should be considered heretical. For instance the commentator of the book of Esther considers the book three seperate tales combined to make historical points but cannot be proved to be historically true. So far this has made me uncomfortable with this Bible being one of my main sources of study. Although this Bible seems to be very scholarly in its content reaserched seemingly thoroghly, giving good information. It seems that the contributors are attempting to undermine divine inspiration of the Bible. This study Bible must be used always with other study Bibles sound in its doctrine. 
 Don't be fooled by the "1 available" blurb, they don't have it.  I have been waiting four months for the copy I ordered.  Every month they reschedule delivery for five weeks later.  Oh, they WILL bill your credit card at time of purchase--they just wont tell you they don't have the book until it is time to ship.  If you really want this book, pay the big bucks and buy it used 
 Sometime before 2000 archaeologista and or historians showed that the Saxons actually started in Roman Britain just BEFORE the Romans pulled out. THe saxons were actually in the service of the Roman army. Yet Hogg never mentions that when he discusses Angle ans Saxon settlement of Britain he appears to believe that the Saxons came to Britain only after the Romans pulled in AD 407. Also, it doesn't look as if Hogg mentions any of the DNA studies by Luigui Cavalli-Sforza that shows how close genetically English are to pretty much above all the Dutch. Hogg does mention the English language's close affinity to the Frisian and Dutch lanhguages though. As a side note the English used to believe they were directly descended from one of the Lost Jewish tribes of Israel (the English aren't actually they are only neolithically Syrian as DNA studies by scientist Spencer Wells showed). It would have been interesting if Hogg had put some comparisons between old Enlish and Jewish and other Syrian languages and mentioned this now disproven theory 
 Boy this movie was weird and psycho. I happen to like the weird movies but it was WAY off the psycho side for me. Friends try to cover up an "accidental death" from one of their friends when they try to pull a prank that goes horribly wrong. Things like this, I try to stay away from. Although I am glad I saw it so I won't always wonder if this movie was actually watchable or not. Now I know. I gave it 2 stars because the movie DID have it's charms. 
 While yes, it is almost universally accepted that other, former, religions "shaped the Christian world". That would be a grave error, to say that it continues to shape it. Almost as grave as mistaking early Christian practices with the modern day Church. The Mysteries of Mithras, was in my opinion both fascinating and frightning. I was fascinated to learn about such a ancient and complex religion but on the other hand, it was recommended to me by a friend, who I will call Nrob. He has it in his head that Mithras was THE foundation of Christian law when it was many things and some even unique that came to form the power house religion of the modern world 
 I gave this book two stars because I admire anyone who can summon the sheer willpower needed to complete a novel of nonsense--particularly one with as much deadwood between the covers as this one. One must also admire the salemanship that must have been displayed when FW was presented to a publisher. If not for these factors it would have gotten one star. Please don't be sucked into the crowd that thinks a book is really good if they can't understand it. Instead, rate highly the book whos author presented you with a clear story, made you want to read the next page, and perhaps, in the end, changed your view of the world 
 I bought this book in preparation for my first trip to Thailand.  I was hoping for a readable overview of Thailand's history to enhance my stay.  Unfortunately, I came away less than satisfied with Wyatt's book.  It was long and tedious.  His writing style is pedantic and dull.  The author clearly knows his subject well, but his treatment of Thai history was long on details, presented chronologically, but short on interpretation.  Surprisingly, there was little in the book about how Buddhism affected the course of historical events.  After finishing the book as the plane touched down in Bangkok, I had assimilated a number of important facts about Thailand, but I didn't feel that the book gave me the chance to understand the sweep of Thai history.  Yet, my research did not find any other book in English which covers the subject.  Until one comes along, hopefully a better one, I guess this is it 
 Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101.  In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison 
 This book was difficult to get through.  The writing felt very, well, written.  Imagine an FBI agent talking for fifteen minutes while apprehending a bad guy.  Imagine this same agent uttering such phrases as "this weapon should evidence your homocidal intent" and other such phony and cacaphonic tripe, and you will only begin to understand how silly this book is.  Baldacci comes across like a librarian in an argyle sweater trying to write tough "zingers" on every page.  He has no idea how real people might talk in dangerous circumstances, so he tries to overcompensate with embarassing results.  I personally blushed or groaned nearly every page at his feminine rage being spewed out in dialogue and descriptions that miss the mark in every conceievable fashion.    Add to this the idiocy of the main character--acting in ways both too stupid and too intelligent to be any real protagonist, and the contrivances of plot needed to milk this meager theme for hundreds of pages, and you see the frustrating experience it is to read the work.  I shall regale you with one more fine example of the action scenes--when Sydney has met with a "deadly" [Baldacci's thesaurus apparently has only two words: deadly and murderous] intruder in her home, Sydney has a weapon trained on him at near-point blank range when he suddenly catapults into a swan dive behind the couch!  "Milliseconds" before she can fire, he launches himself behind the couch.    Is this "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?"  No, just Baldacci sipping cups of cocoa on doilies trying to make up action sequences before returning to his needlepoint 
 I was so disappointed with this item. My son (who's 3) received this for his bday. The child has to continuously hold down a button with his hand to keep the train moving and my son couldn't do it. He ended up getting so frustrated, he broke down in tears! The noises the train makes are MUCH TOO LOUD! And you need a lot of room in your home to set up the track, which we do not have. I was surprised at how poorly designed this was since it's a Peg Perego. The manufacturers should've really tried this one out on the recommended age group before they released it. Why couldn't there be a pedal to step on to make it go like every other ride-on toy for little ones? I put it back in the box and back to the store it went. 
 Its been  a while since I seen a crapfest such as this. From the start it was clear that I was going to despise the flick, although the full frontal nudity in the beginning was'nt half-bad. WHy anyone, especially a female, would want to skinny dip alone in a old secluded lake is beyond me, but we get  alot of that here. In fact,ther's one sequence where a group of seven girls, just finish a basketball gameand decide to get fully naked and take a dip in the lake. Although this was supposedly set in the 50s it was clearly made in the 80s, and I guess bathing suits weren't a necessity back then. The story revolves around a town that's plagued by rumors of missing people around the 'lake of the damned' a name dubbed after a number of German soldiers were massacred and thrown into the lake.The story behind the lake goes back to the timesof the inquisition where the lake was once thought to be a place of sacrafice to please the gods, and without one, they will rise from the depths of the lkae wrecking all sorts of havoc. This leads to our dead Nazi rising from the lake and doing harm to anyone who decides to trespass; apparently they weren't properly sacraficed. There a 20 minute sequence explaining everything, or more specifically, showing us what happened since there's little to no dialogue throughout the entire sequence. In fact, there are many scenes in the movie that have no dialogue, which probably would'nt have done the movie much good anyway, especially with its incredibly slow pacing. There are even some scenes that last entirely too long, while others are just poinless. Whether it was intentional or not,there a funny scene involving a zombie returning home to greet his daughter(who wasn't born when he died),giving viewers what we want while watching a zombie film -- faimly bonding and much needed dramatic pauses. Speaking of dumb zombies, the basic make-up is green -- yes there are no huge gashes, or clearly rotted flesh, but instead we have zombies that are just a little too moldy . On the plus side, there is a decent part in the film where the zombies decide to run amok in the town, although you wouldn't know it since it was way too damn dark to see what was going on, which was another continuing occurrence thoughout the film. You hardly guess this was a zombie movie since there was zero gore. Thats 90 minutes of my life I will not get back. I've seen some pretty bad zombie flicks in my years and this is another one to add to that list.The only thing that made it watchable was all the excessive nudity, but even then it was barely worth anyone's time. Avoid at all cost! 
 The thrilling mystery story that we have come to expect from Anne Perry takes a new twist in this book. Perhaps inspired by true events in 1898 Vienna, where three persons died of plague, this is not so much a story of crime but of survival. Unfortunately other qualitites that we have also come to expect from this author, like sound research and verisimilitude, are absent here. There are glaring gaps in logic, occasional sloppy proofing, and, at least as I understand the nature of plague, serious factual mistakes. This is too bad, since the story could have been a fitting installment in the quest of the protagonists for social improvement in mid-19th century London. As it is, the book gave me the impression that perhaps Anne Perry has currently too many irons in the fire and no longer spends enough time on the kind of careful work that characterized her earlier novels 
 This book backs up common sense with anecdotes and examples from real life parents in a wide variety of second-child situations (ranging from closs-in-age to far apart, 2-child and 3,4-child familes...). Unfortunately, I found most of the points it made were just that, and that if you were a conscientious parent who studied and tried hard with your first child, you would already have known most of what was in here. If you're looking for a primer that doesn't talk down to you the way many first-time parenting books do, this is a quick and fair read. If you're looking for new examples and things you haven't heard before, there are better books than this one 
 After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments.  On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before.  But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from "Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham." There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again 
 Beautiful piece. A dragon just seen in dreams (or nightmares). I recommend 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 Another lopez "vehicle" in other words people who think Jlo is the "bomb" will watch it no matter how many other fine movies are out there.  It's too hard to find them. Just go see dumb jlo movie. She's "really good" 
 I took a numerical analysis course last semester at my university and had a horrible time understanding this book. As many reviewers have already stated, there aren't very many examples and the explanations aren't very clear. I had to refer to a number of other books from the school library to actually figure anything out. Don't waste your money on this book, there are much better books on the subject out there 
 I was looking for help with my relationship addiction.  This book is so stuffed with mumbo jumbo I couldn't get through the first chapter.  
 This movie was pretty awful. Since I am ranking it with 1 star, then according to another reviewer I must not have a soul. Hey, it doesn't feel bad!  This movie has the worst black stereotyping of any of movie I have ever seen, particularly in a sci-fi movie. It is worse than the blaxploitation films of the 70's, which were at least entertaining.  This movie is about a group of teenage white kids, with one token black thrown in just for the hell of it. "But just how 'black' is he?," you may be wondering. Well the movie makes it clear that he's a true soul man because it goes out of its way to establish these facts:  1. He talks different from the whites. ("Hey Bodee." "His name's Bodhi!" "Well you say it your way, and I'll say it mine." Or something to that effect.)  2. He breakdances. (And we all know that all black people can breakdance, can't they?)  3. He likes basketball. (Again, every white person knows that black people all like basketball and they are all good at it, right?)  4. He raps. (Because a person isn't truly black unless they can do a little hip-hop, can they?)  I'm a white guy. And I'm not overly sensitive to racism issues. But watching this movie really surprised me. I was amazed to see such a blatant black stereotype. I can't say that it's a good thing. It is quite embarassing to watch, actually. What where they thinking? This movie would never have been made that way in today's day and age.   The movie itself is pretty lame. It was made back in the roller-blading / cyberpunk craze of the 80's. It has the usual bleak dystopian future typical of those movies in those days. It also features a funky little ball named Bodhi. It is the weirdest, most nonsensical story I have ever watched. It is almost like a bad dream that somebody wrote down as soon as they woke up, which was later worked into a screenplay.  This movie is so stupid that it is painful to watch. The only good reason to see it is to see a few young actors such as Jason Patric (The Lost Boys) and Jami Gertz (The Lost Boys, Twister, Still Standing). It is also nice to see Richard Jordan (Logan's Run), as well as the stunning Sarah Douglas (Superman II, Conan the Destroyer) starring in a villainess roll, as usual.   Sarah Douglas really does make a good villain, too. It's too bad that her talent was so wasted in this crapfest of a movie. "Sphere of longiness"? Ech!  I don't understand all you people who are giving this movie 5 stars. I mean, what are you thinking? It has to be just the "I love the 80's" nostalgia-factor kicking in. I don't see any other rational reason for this phenomenon.  And please. Skating on an overgrown road? Skating in the dirt? They'd get about 10 feet before a rock stuck in their skates and they went flying. It might be fun to watch if you can make yourself believe that rollerblades work in the sand.  I'd have to say, that other dystopian future skating flick, "Prayer of the Rollerboys" is a much better movie than this. Of course that ain't saying much, because that movie pretty much stinks too.  Buy something else. ANYTHING else. If not for yourself, then at least to show the black people of the world a little basic human respect 
 Not worth it. Weight fluctuates daily 3-5 pounds. Accuracy is questionable 
 One of them arrived damaged on the printer head so did not even print one page.  The other one did not print as many pages as I'd expected.  Besides the color fades away too fast. Contacted the company without any reply.  You'd better go for the genuine HP product. 
 This book is better than nothing but has no real depth.  It lacks any real financal information or planning guidelines.  In the era of the web there are almost no sites or addresses listed.This is just a walk in the park where it must have been written. If you are serious, look elsewhere 
 The original CSI series is FANTASTIC because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence.  This series uses the CSI name without the investigating that makes the original so good.  It is mainly a mellow-drama surrounding the lives of the characters.  Some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor, but there's no mystery 
 As the last reviewer indicated, this book does indeed have a catchy title.  What lies within thought is not anything quite as catchy.  Most tips are briefly touched upon without going into more in depth detail.  The book seems to be written for single women and even goes as far as to give tips on obtaining and keeping men.  Which is out of the subject title boundaries.  If the tips were good, I might have been ok with that.  The tips were poor, one example being don't have too neat of an apartment because men don't like that.  Better advice - just be yourself rather that worrying whether your apartment is too neat.  Most men, from my experience, really don't care 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 I was disappointed in this one. The characters were uninteresting and disappointing; the story was flat; but the writing.... well, this was the first book I read by Mr. Russell and it will probably be my last. While I can appreciate stream-of-consciousness writing (when it is done well), it can also be very annoying and confusing. There were times Mr. Russell went on and on about something that happens in the past, and then suddenly--without any clue or warning--he comes back to the present. Very confusing, hard to follow and hard to read. He's lucky he got one star out of me! Skip this one. Seriously 
 Well, my mistake. I now promise myself to research authors and books just a tiny bit before I impulsively add them to my shopping cart based on a couple minutes of TV exposure and a clever title and cover; at least I can start paying attention to the reputation of the publishing house. At page 250, Saxen ponders whether he has enough "material" actually to constitute a book. Let me answer that for you: NO. I recognize the book is labeled a memoir, but still, it lacks any evidence of insight or mature thought whatsoever. And I'm dumbfounded that anyone paged through this shallow and self-indulgent memoir and sent it to press.  My advice: avoid this vacuous, paralyzingly dull waste of trees, and read instead "Binge No More."    
 I read chic-lit, a lot. I found myself truly disappointed in this book. What a waste of time! 
 This was the 2nd DVD with problems that I bought from this vendor.  The first DVD had 2 sections where the DVD would pause but would continue playing, and I was willing to live with it.  Bootcamp/Muscle Endurance, on the other hand, would not play the Muscle Endurance workout at all!  I contacted the vendor and they said it was a problem with my DVD player and they would only allow me to exchange with any of their 'OPEN' dvds only to 'better suite my needs'.  I own 20+ workout DVDs and none of them gave me any problems like this one did.  The DVD is also fairly pricey and so I'm afraid to buy any more of these dvds from them.  I was able to play the Bootcamp workout until towards the end (before the cool down section) where it would not continue playing.  I like Cathe's workout very much.  The part of Bootcamp that I was able to play was excellent! But I am very disappointed with this vendor 
 It's just one of those things you end up watching at 3 in the morning. But skip this one. You should be sleeping. I am a die-hard Strokes fan so when New York Stories came out, I had to have it. Much to my disappointment, it turned out to contain no music by The Strokes, or interviews with any members of the band.  If you still feel like you need to see this DVD, don't pay more than $5 for it. You have been officially warned 
 If you're a Ludlum fan, like I am, you will be acutely disappointed in this bomb. After the likes of The Sigma Protocol and The Janson Directive, this one is about as interesting as watching the tide come in. It starts with a hackneyed premise of terrorist weapon materials being transported to China, then comes to a grinding halt as the "story" stagnates for hundreds of pages, going on and on, with no advancement of the plot whatsoever, like a car stuck in the mud. 
 This book is a horrible disappointment.  After all of the "positive' press received by Mr. Campbell, even on NPR, I decided to purchase the book.  To make my biases clear, I am not an oil executive or investor.  I work for a modestly-sized electric utility in the United States that uses natural gas to generate a modest portion of its electricity.  I do not share a number of the views of the current administration and voted against it in the last election.  I have spent my 15-year career in a planning department making resource decisions.  I read this book only in an attempt to fill in some of the missing pieces of the puzzle that is our energy marketplace.  My first surprise was Mr. Campbell's admission up front that he would "digress frequently into political and other matters outside of [his] own professional expertise."  To be blunt, in my professional opinion, much of this book is based on matters over which Mr. Campbell has limited or misinformed knowledge.  A great example of this is the wasted text of Chapter 10 entitled "Economists Never Get It Right."  In reading this chapter, I have the feeling that while Mr. Campbell might well have read some of the work of Keynes and Smith, it was well over his head.  Much of the book is a self-appreciation exercise, with Mr. Campbell's opinions trumping facts.  He provides a number of conspiracy theories (nothing more) to support his opinions.  His wildest begins on page 191 where he essentially accuses the US Government of carrying out the attacks on the World Trade Center.  Further to this point, Mr. Campbell clearly carries a grudge against the US and makes various jabs at the country that are unnecessary to make his point.  His view of the future also appears tainted by what comes off as his personal desires for a return to the simple life where in his home country (Ireland) "Women remain in the home...Christmas trees will no longer be exported to Germany...pubs will be stocked with home-brewed stout...people will meet in each other's homes for songs and to dance..."  He also has decided that the ocean will provide "a near perpetual almost free supply [of energy].  If you are a nay-sayer that believes the world is about to end, and you want to grieve without critical thought, you might find this book useful.  But for the rest of us who are capable of critical thought, look for another title.  This book doesn't deserve the paper it was written on.  Shame on NPR for giving it the light of day.  I would be happy to hear your opinions on this book.  Please e-mail me at powereconomist@hotmail.com.  Thanks 
 This will teach me not to read the reviews carefully before purchase.  This is a very abridged version of the classic story: the bright shiny engine and the big strong engine are nowhere to be found.  If you're after  the book you remember from your childhood, find another version.  The  illustrations are bright & fun, but there's just too much missing from  the story 
 This was not what I was expecting.  Maybe I need to give it a better chance.  But, frankly at this point I feel that I wasted my money. Unless, someone out there likes monotone, this one will not serve you well.  Not recommended 
 apparently none of you have sensitive skin, because if you did, you would understand that all those receipes that include the use of alcohol would murder your skin!  especially the one for problem skin, my face hurt just  reading it!  i would also like to add that, for what you would need to put  on your skin to kill the bacteria that grew there from all the spoiling  FOOD you just had on your skin...it's not worth it. i was quite  disappointed with this book, except for the incredibly well known use of  cucumber...all you're going to do is damage your skin, upset it's natural  balance or give yourself an infection. it sounds really nice, but there are  tons of alcohol free, safe herbal products out there that would do a lot  better for you 
 If you're a fan of Migs' stuff on NRK, you will definitely not be so interested in this collection.  Completely missing are those groovy bass lines that Migs does so well and what is left are a bunch of overly glossy diva trax that are pretty lightweight even by Naked standards.  Check out his "City Sounds" or his own tracks on "24th Street Sounds" to get the essence of what Miguel Migs is all about 
 The Good: The book contains an abundance of illustrations which can be very helpful.  The author uses the text of the book itself as bad examples of design.  The Bad: As a newbie to publication design, I approached this book as a student.  I probably would have never even opened the cover of it if it weren't required for a class.  The design of the cover (and most of the book) is horrible.  I can't read the title and it does nothing to attract me visually.  The illustrations are so sloppy they are unprofessional.  Although sketches in real life should be messy, the sketches in the book should at least be interpretable.  The author never uses any concrete terminology, so it is difficult categorize information as you absorb it. 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 the crappiest DVD release ever! video and audio quality sucks! this is not a Jet Li movie. buyer's beware! i'll give this a negative rating 
 one of the most pretentious and exaggerating movies ever seen. the dialogue, the acting...whatever, all suck big time. everything in this movie looked unrealistic, not funny but pathetically pretentious and exaggerating to the extreme. that kinda performance would have won an oscar, yeah, right, maybe just because there were only worse pictures nominated in that year. what a hype 
 Oh, I get it alright.  The joke is, I thought the dvd would be funny, and it wasn't, and they got my thirty bucks!  Ho ho ho!  The premise is this: Two guys you've never heard of and Michael Ian Black (the guy who says snarky things about pop culture on VH1) have seen and have enjoyed The Kids in the Hall.  So they steal a few of the characters from the show, and convince Comedy Central to give them 13 episodes.  And then MAGIC is supposed to happen.  The two guys you've never heard of are quite good at playing slow troglodytes, but Michael Ian Black, well, he just can't quite commit to the character he's stolen from Kids in the Hall, and in true Adam Sandler/Ben Affleck tradition, mugs and smirks his way through painfully unfunny dialogue.  The show tries to be many things.  It wants to be Kids in the Hall, obviously, and it also wants to be Arrested Development.  It'd like to be reminiscent of The Office, but it'll settle for Reno 911.  It is none of these shows.  If I was being kind, I'd call it performance art concocted to test the boundaries of a viewer's patience.  "How long can this go on without being funny," one asks oneself.  "Surely it will be funny next episode!"  Nothin' doin'.  If the popular kids in your high school got together and put on a "funny skit" for a talent show, it might be something like this.  Without Michael Ian Black's involvement, it can only be better than STELLA.  And in answer to the question posed a moment ago, this show can go on 10 episodes without being funny.  And then Comedy Central mercifully pulled the plug 
 I work in a child care facility and my staff were looking for the words and music for the cha cha slide.  They were teaching the children so they could perform it at their preschool graduation.  Well let me tell you it was a hit and the parents even joined in.    Ever since that night, the other preschool classrooms wanted to have some fun too and I let the other classrooms listen and dance.  My only concern is that I don't get to use it too much because it is always on loan.  I wish I had more copies!  Thank you for helping my staff keep their children learning fun ways to listen,exercise, share and socialize with others 
 I have gone through 3 of these straighteners (i know, you think I would have learned!) however, my first one was lost, my second one stopped working in a matter of months, and the third one stop working in less than a month!! I purchased the third one (despite what happened with the second one I had bought) because it was an affordable price, I liked the size, and when the second one I had did work it worked well. Unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works (causing obvious problems). I would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive, but I think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for 
 Brent offers a money-back guarantee at his events, where he would give a reader a dollar if they came up with his book and told them it was boring.  After reading the book, I am ready for my dollar 
 I was one of many birth-mothers who received a copy of this book when considering open adoption. It seemed to be written for the adoptive perents to persuade them into open adption. The Open Adoption Experiance and The Other Mother are much better choices for birthmothers, and really give them the information they would need to make an informed choice 
 !!! Pathetic !!! ... excuse me, PATHETIC ! Buying this book online had taught me to FIRST READ the REVIEWS and if at all possible look at the local bookstore before you buy online.  I keep picking this book up, and then putting it down ,,, and if ever a book needed to be put down, it is this one. Normalization, page 36 and page 39 ,,, kind of.   Save your time, save your money ... this isn't for mere mortals, it is for someone who doesn't need to know about Database Design.  Move along folks, there's nothing to see here ... it's just an accident 
 This book is the worst book I ever had since I was born. The author did not do a great job constructing sentences (or should i say did not know how to). His ideas were too vague, his sentences were too confusing and its very impossible to learn and understand American history if one is going to use this book alone, especially if he is not an American who had American history in high school. If you are not American and have no idea of American history and need to use this book, DROP THE COURSE. Its better to drop early than suffer the consequences of failing the course. If there were a -99 rating, I'll give it a -100 
 This book is the first one you will reach for if it is your first pregnancy. Save your cash and get it from the library. Then read something that expects you to be a thinking woman, not a child taking orders or information without question. If you want to go through pregnancy, labor and birth, and have no say at all or learn anything useful, then stick with this book; i.e., go to the hospital, have an epidural, episiotomy, then finally the c-section that 'must' have been necessary, this is it.   Beyond that, read Ina May Gaskins, Henci Goer, the Sears' books, and "Childbirth Without Fear." Read a broader selection - many of which you can also get from a library or spend a night thumbing through at a bookstore.  I am a mother of 4; have had healthier, more positive birth experiences than anyone I know. This book is misleading and negative.  Make it the joyful event you deserve 
 Achebe was correct when he described this book as a sick book. It is. Just disgusting and trying to hard to be sophisticated, ie, "European". The description by Achebe that Armah's book reminds him of the Jean Paul Sartre novel where two characters sit around looking bored in a cafe in Paris and then in a burst of nihilistic energy decide to stab themselves to make some obscure point to each other. He's on the money. Unfortunately Armah came on the scene when publishing in Africa was not more discriminating 
     This vacuum cleaner has been junk from day one. Poor quality accessories that broke easily and were expensive to replace, retractable cord that rarely retracts. All this, and it barely cleans anything. Don't buy it. The folks at Hoover should be ashamed of themselves 
 I recently saw Danielle Steel interviewed and was impressed that she had raised 9 children, lost a son to suicide, and did so much humanitarian work.  I'm not a fan of this type of novel but thought I would give it a try since I was so impressed with her in the interview.  There were two things that drove me nuts about this book, the most annoying of which was her repetition of words and phrases, often right on the same page.  "He was going to ask Carole" and then in the next paragraph, "He had decided to ask Carole."  The second most annoying thing was all the cliches.  It isn't often that I roll my eyes while reading a book.  I also think she spends way too much time with her superficial descriptions of places and people and not enough time having them do things.  I like the way other authors develop their characters by showing us how they behave, react and what they say in different situations.  I think having a character kick a dog (3 words) tells you a whole lot more about them than 50 pages of superficial drivel, which this book is full of.  I think Danielle Steel is a remarkable woman, but as an author, at least of this particular book, I don't see the magic or talent I expected from a person who has been called, "the world's most popular author."  447 pages.  Two days.  That's time I could have used elsewhere, feeding the hungry or ministering to the poor or sick.  OK, probably just reading another book 
 This is the same character that was in A Little Death?  The two "Henry Rioses" resemble each other not at all.  In A Little Death, he was hardboiled, cynical and somewhat bitter.  In Rag and Bone, he was all lovey-dovey and rosy.  In fact, the total style of writing is completely different from book to book.  Neither one impressed me, but Rag and Bone especially left a sickening sweet, nasty taste in my mouth.  I'm glad I only wasted money on two of his books

 Perelman catalogs a litany of injustices (perceived and real) associated with intellectual property. The injustices themselves are fairly interesting, but Perelman's analysis is shrill and unashamedly biased - every case builds into his thesis that intellectual property is evil and must be replaced...  But this is the biggest problem with the book - 150 pages of criticism of the system that builds to a crescendo of NOTHING. At the end of the book he reveals that he doesn't have any idea of how the system could be improved or what it could be replaced with; even an implausible or unworkable suggestion would be better than none at all.  In the end I was left disappointed but not altogether unsurprised 
 I bought it for my son to use with the Original Pixter also. And,I found what it was compatible with, after I realized that it didn't work with the original Pixter. The box I have says down in the bottom right corner (if the back of the box is facing you) of the back of the box in tiny print "compatible with Pixter Plus and Pixter 2.0".  You would think they would put that on the front 
 The blurbs on the back give this book away. Law teachers and lawyers think it is excellent. No historians are included in any of this praise. As an exercize in rethinking the constitution this is an enjoyable, thoughtful piece of work. But Fletcher has not read much about Abraham Lincoln's actions and ideas. He is especially off course in claiming that Lincoln ignored the constitution in the midst of war. Lincoln practiced law for a quarter of a century, gave major speeches on the meaning of the constitution, followed the constitutional requirements on suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus--at least the leading constitutional lawyer in Congress, Reverdy Johnson, the patriarch of the American Bar, Horace Binney, and the profesor of constitutional law at Harvard thought.

 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 IMHO...Here's one of those times when the movie was much better realized and much more suspenseful than the book.  The DVD is available for purchase or rent.  The work is, however, original, and if one likes "coming of age" stories, this one is okay.  But if you WATCH it, you won't need popcorn!      
 Once again Gary Null "Phd" recycles information into another GN book with his one size fits all vegeterian diet and vits and supplements. Gary Null is probably the only author that carries a Phd and fails to reveal where he got his BA, MA and Phd. A quick reading of Quakwatch.com shows that Gary Null has  "nontraditional" credentials and owns a multi-million dollar supplement company. He also sells everything from magnets to water and air filters.   The confusing thing is why someone consuming a nutrient dense diet of organic vegetables, fruit and legumes would need supplements at all. The only reason I could think of is it is a bait and switch technique since most people unable to continue any diet that is restrictive, time consuming and costly give up. So GN conveniently has dozens of vits, supplements, and food replacement products to fill in the gap. I estimate the cost of following GN recommendations in full it would cost about $600 per person a month. To prove my point GN for decades has been against chocolate but recently he has added a GN "healthy" chocolate bar to his portfolio. Gary hooks people in by promising the fountain of youth and eternal life. Interestingly this 60 plus year old finds it necessary to put a old stock photo of himself in his books. 
 MOON CALLED is no relation to Norton's Yiktor series; this is an "after the fall of civilization" novel more along the lines of NO NIGHT WITHOUT STARS or STAR MAN'S SON, though evidently not in the same setting as either. As in those stories, the protagonist of MOON CALLED was an apprentice being trained in relatively arcane, specialized knowledge - in this case, a priestess - who was cast adrift from her people before the story opens. Unlike the protagonists of several other Norton stories in this vein, Thora was not exiled; her native village was destroyed by pirates, leaving her to make her way in the world alone.  Stumbling across an alien, injured stranger by chance, Thora is drawn into contact with Malkin's native society, wherein Malkin is familiar - lifelong companion, if you like - to a man of power in that society, wherein the gender roles are not quite reversed from those in Thora's own culture (down to serial polyandry in Makil's society, as opposed to polygamy in Thora's). Thora goes through some culture shock, but not much - Makil's society is only peripherally explored, mostly concerning those aspects that a hunter and sentry without strong family ties would see.  With very little tweaking, the story could've been dropped onto either continent of the Witch World during the Kolder War; the new universe introduced here isn't very memorable, and the post-apocalyptic aspects aren't utilized beyond setting up a "cache of very dangerous stuff" that could've been almost any McGuffin without loss of originality. (Thora and Makil's people have to make sure it doesn't fall into the wrong hands, with some disagreement among Makil's people about whether it might be useful for *them* to exploit.) No suggestion that I noticed of how the now-dominant religions, magic use, and so on happened to develop; throwing "Set" in as the name of the deity worshipped by the forces of evil is a little jarring for that reason, because none of the other religious elements seem to have such a clear connection to present-day mythology (generic moon goddess, Lord of Light, that sort of thing for the other religions).  While this book has its moments - I'll grant any of Norton's books that, though it doesn't quite make the three-star cut for me - I would recommend DARKNESS AND DAWN or SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD over it for similar material given better handling. Elys' story in SPELL OF THE WITCH WORLD has some similarity to Thora's, but has a much more fleshed-out setting (though a more standard resolution of her relationship with Jervon than Thora has with Makil).  Nitpicks: - It doesn't ring true that other survivors of Thora's native village scattered without trying to regroup, or that Thora abandoned them without more backstory and effects on her character. (Thora doesn't seem to know if there were other survivors, or care.) Norton offers some explanation for Thora's detachment, but it seems thin. She was being trained as a priestess and a major figure in the community, but feels no apparent responsibility apart from her duty to protect various religious artifacts. For her, being a priestess seems to be about her special Chosen status, not at all about her relationship with/responsibilities to other people. (While this is certainly one way to develop a society, Thora lost her home and everything she ever knew except her dog, and doesn't seem to have been affected at all as the story opens a few months down the line.) - Thora doesn't quite seem to have the responses of a trained fighter - on poking into a strange, darkened room, she remains silhouetted in the doorway, and generally doesn't seem to be as prone to moving cautiously (or not at all) as one might expect a lone wanderer to need to be. - Granted that this is a setting without efficient mass communication, it still seems that travellers' tales would've at least made Thora acquainted with Makil's people by rumour before she encountered them, since they're within a few months' journey at walking pace (a lot less, possibly) from her native village.  The back cover blurb for the first edition is poor, by the by 
 They tell you tha this product holds 6AA batteries, and works with the 20D's battery grip, but when I received the item it is for a completely different product and DOES NOT WORK with the 20D's BG-E2 grip.  It has the product name of CPM-E3, just as stated...but it accepts 8 AAA batteries and doesn't even come close to working with the BG-E2.  
 So beware, for regular size watch's only.  Will not open a Marine Star, or anything bigger 
 I admit that I'm far from an expert on digital cameras. I did take over 32,000 photographs with 35mm cameras for over 20 years.  I purchased a 510 PowerShot in July of 2005. It wasn't too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn't work. I contacted Canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge ME for shipping THEIR faulty camera back to them. I can understand them saying, 'we'll charge you at first, BUT once we establish that the fault is due to us, we'll then reimburse you back.'  I enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that Canon contact me when they received my camera (in the mail) and I also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back. (I also emailed them the same request). Neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on Canon's behalf.  That in itself was enough for me and I've been bitter about that ever since. I've also told every person that I've met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident. I'm pleased to say, I've steered most away from this company.  What else can I say about this camera:  This camera is slow at times after its taken a picture. I've missed out on some good shots due to this.  It eats batteries like there's no tomorrow so one MUST have rechargeable AA's to even make this camera worth its while.  I've not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if I take a 3 minute movie (with this camera) in my home during the day and go outside, most things outside are VERY WHITE. Almost like looking at an infra red photograph.  When filming outside, when one goes inside during the day, everything is dark. Like I said, maybe all digital cameras are this way?  I wouldn't recommend this camera or anything that Canon makes if you want my personal opinion. Think about that. You have to pay the shipping for a camera that's barely a few months old and still UNDER warranty. That's disgusting, that's all I have to say.  There should be a ZERO for this, not a 1 star 
 Woolf's style of writing (changing between several characters' thoughts) causes difficulty for one to follow this novel on audio. The paperback proved to be easier for me. 
 I've only used the unit 3 times, and the flip-over trimmer broke when I "flipped" it over to attach to the main clipper head. The plastic attachment for the flip over trimmer is supposed to fit over the main head, that cracked in two, and about 8 pieces scattered on the floor. It's very disappointing. I'm hoping the rest of the unti will perform for longer, I can't seem to find the receipt 
 These are NOT Riedel crystal!  After I returned them, I told Amazon that that need to update the description.  If you read the fine print, it does say "Manufactured to exact specifications of Riedel, Austria".  They are made by some other company, not in Austria, and the quality is very, very low.  You get what you pay for 
 Frankly, I'm still ticked at having wasted however many hours of my life it took to read YSKOV! (and does anybody else find the exclamation mark as pretentious as all get-out?)  The original hardcover was fascinating: I'd never seen a book in such a hurry to get started that the text began right on the cover.  This was a guy I could get to like.  Problem was, I bought the later paperback edition in an effort to save a few dollars.  If you're still curious, do yourself a favor and spring for the original hardcover--it's a good deal less bloated.  Were there brilliant pages/paragraphs?  Sure.  Too bad they were so interspersed with self-indulgent, pseudo-self-deprecating, unfunny filler as to nearly ruin the book.  I spent the first 100 pages or so enchanted and the last several hundred wishing he and his friend would just go home already 
 It works sometimes but most the time it can't pick up enough of a signal to work.  
 It Could Happen to You was a bit of a disappointment, considering the makeup of the cast: Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda, and Rosie Perez among others. The movie brings to the screen the story of a policeman who after winning 4 million dollars on the NY state lotto, decides to share half of it with a waitress he met the previous day.   The acting is surprisingly (!) below average, the dialogues are way below average, while the plot is not bad at all.   Nicolas Cage's character is too naive and too slow, and that was just sad/pitiful! Bridget Fonda was unexpectedly plain and bland. Rosie Perez's character was overly exaggerated to the point that it got tiring AND annoying very early on. As for Wendell Pierce and Stanley Tucci this film does not seem to be their thing; they don't seem to belong.  Subsequently, they are not convincing in their roles at all. Finally, somebody shoot the "Narrator," PLEASE! Though the potential for a great movie was definitely there it fails to take off.  A shame really...  No masterpiece here. If Nicolas Cage is what you had in mind, check out the AMAZING movies City of Angels and/or The Family Man. 
 As a follower of the Celebration story for many years, I was greatly disappointed by what I thought would be a new and interesting perspective on the model town.  It was nothing of the sort.  The book had the feel of  so many pages of anti-Disney propaganda, and the repetitiveness of a bad  serial.  The authors of Celebration U.S.A. clearly made up their minds  about Celebration long before signing off on a mortgage.  Lacking in the  detail needed to illustrate Celebration's experiment with the tenets of  neotraditional style, the book offered splashes of cliched generalities  such as "a return to the past" and "recapturing tradition."  It soon became  some sort of mantra exhorting Disney's ownership of the town, the rules  imposed on property improvements and maintenance, and, interestingly, the  attention the town received.  Most tactless of all was the shadow of  mockery cast on every description of residents, conversation with  neighbors, and interaction with people doing what the authors SHOULD have  been doing: giving the town a chance 
 Although the announcement makes you think that maybe yo will be getting 20 books for a song, you will be singing a different tune when it arrives.  You will get one (yes, 1) volume selected apparently at random.  I got volume 13 
 I can't believe I bought this, one of the worst purchases I've ever made.  Far from being a step-by-step how to actually set up a web site, it's filled with "if you want to do this, then do this, or if you want to do that, then do that."  Perhaps I'm more comfortable with programming books that actually step you through a series of ever-increasingly-complex projects in order to teach you how to use the languange.  This book reads more like a reference book for those who already know FrontPage, or a page-by-page description of what the controls will do rather than why I would want to use the control in the first place.  IMO, it's hardly a beginner's book, and not worth the deeply discounted price it's selling for 
 Another reviewer is correct in that there are SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS of the book missing in the Great Minds Series (green and black cover).  In one instance, I noted that 150 pages were converted into 14!  Also, Book IV Chapter VII is missing parts 2 and 3 (also quite lengthy portions of the piece).  Go with a complete version if you're going to bother to tackle this book, or especially if you are focussing on one particular idea (since that may be one that they cut out!)...Smith may be wordy, but to cut out such an enormous amount degrades the integrity of the work.  Shameful to nowhere state that LARGE chunks of this classic are absent...at least be forthcoming!  If you choose a more complete version you'll get to read a classic from a better economist than a writer, but still a fantastic piece of work.  Smith does tend to try to overexplain things, but you get use to his style and can appreciate that he just wants to make sure that you get his point.  AMMENDMENT: Upon discussion with my Economics professor, it is possible that this green book was one of the author's first versions (which he apparently edited and added to more than once).  I still say that the publisher should be more clear about the version, and that if you want his most recent updates and complete work, to look elsewhere 
 This is one of the most far-fetched, outrageous mysteries I've ever read.  Alex Delaware is a thirty-something, retired, child psychologist.  When his cop friend asks him to help on a murder case, the good doctor suddenly becomes a sleuth asking questions with no apparent purpose.  His questioning leads him from one seemingly unrelated death to another.  All of a sudden, our novice detective is racing for his life from a motorcycle assassin, wrestling with a powerful athlete, and brandishing a gun while talking like Bogart.  The conspiracy plot just isn't believable either--a group of pedophiles running a children's home? And they all happened to be college buddies?  Come on.  Don't waste your time on this one. 
 This book advantage relies on the examples of the "examination questions", which I found matching only a small percentage of the real test. It lacks main concepts and formulas. Worst test preparation material I've ever bought. 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 I bought this book when I was in a hurry.  I wanted a good Vietnam war book to read and didn't take enough time.  Maybe I should have used Amazon ahead of time but so be it.  Anyway, the book is rather a fraud perpetrated by two BBC journalists in order to spout anti-US propaganda.  You will find a lie on just about every page.  When they're not lying, the authors are deliberately distorting or omitting.  I could give examples but if you read the book, you will see what I mean.  The book actually makes a point of mentioning and praising the courage and heroism of the famed American "tunnel rats".  But much of the book is the standard leftist bilge that Vietnamese Communists were "good people".  And much is just the old hackneyed justification for Communist atrocities on a mass scale.  I question the entire book based on the obvious propaganda at the macro level.  Really, if you've experienced enough of that propaganda, then you will gain little from this book and may be left questioning like me - how much of the technical material is inaccurate or embellished or distorted by omission 
 This wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. The biggest disappointment for me were the main players. Few of them really looked like the historical persona. Lincoln's portrayal was a letdown from the start. Although he looked fairly close, his voice was all wrong. Lincoln had a squeaky voice with a real Kentucky twang. (This comes from observations by Lincoln's law partner, Herndon as well as Nicolaye & Haye, Lincoln's secretaries and biographers) Hal Holbrook actually came closest to the right pitch and tone. Even more annoying was the portrayal of Sec. of War Edward Stanton. Here, he comes across like a frustrated grandfather. The real Stanton was NOT a Lincoln fan, he once refered to Lincoln as the "original baboon" and constantly challenged the 16th president on issue after issue. Lincoln would let Stanton have his temper tantrums, but managed to "put his foot down" at the right time. Stanton himself was far from well liked by other members of the cabinet and was actually feared and loathed by many. First Lady Mary Todd was far too slender and attractive in this depiction. If you've ever seen photos of the real Mary, she looked dowdy if not downright frumpy. Her rages were legendary in Washington. She once chased a deliveryman down the street with a broomstick. Secretary Seward called her a "she-wolf" and others dubbed her a bit**. A surprise for me was the portrayal of Dr. Charles A. Leale, the 27 year old Army surgeon who took charge of Lincoln after the shooting. The actor bore more than striking resemblance. It was almost spooky to watch. Jim Bishop's book was followed closely which was one of the more appealing parts of this film. Even snippets of dialog from the book crept in with regularity 
 I purchased this product partially on the recommendation of consumer reports.  Looking back, I would have gone further and NOT bought it.  The iPOD interface is poor at best and the speaker setup via the front menu/remote usage is difficul 
 As a former chemical dependency counselor, I take this piece for what's known in AA/NA as a "war story." That is, he digresses from honest emotion into what amounts to bragging about exploits. Ultimately, drug exploits are tiresome: "I snorted a bunch of cocaine, got it on with a stranger, spent all my money, woke up with a headache, blah, blah, blah."  I also agree with the reviewer who commented that the writing is sloppy and the editing evidently minimal. I had to shut the book for a few minutes after reading about Jayson's seeing the Challenger shuttle hurtle to the earth through his ten-year-old eyes. I cringed with embarrassment as he relays the "touching moment" when his fellow mental hospital patient tells him she "liked black guys in her heyday" and would have gone for him twenty years before. One of many true self-esteem lows that add little to the story 
 Reviewers on Amazon tend to self-select; I've noticed that people (including myself) seem more willing to write reviews of books they loved than of books they disliked. This makes sense; I usually don't even finish reading a book I strongly dislike.  But I had to read this book for a class. It was possibly my least favorite work of literature that I have ever read. Babel's writing is sparse, dry, and frequently cryptic; often I struggled to figure out what was actually going on in the stories. I also found his characters opaque and mysterious, and not in a good way. And all his stories are gloomy, and apt to induce misery in an unsuspecting reader. Babel's writing is rich with layers of meaning, but its about as enjoyable to crack as a caluculus textbook. The difficulty I encountered in reading this book just made Russia seem insurmountably foreign to me. Instead of serving as a bridge to another culture, this book aroused a feeling of alienation in me.  I will not be so presumptuous as to say that Babel is a bad writer. But I must attest that Babel is not for everyone. On my scale--1 star. 
 I think this book is worse than the others written by Savage-Weiner, which is saying a lot. Unfortunately, most reviewers never bothered reading this book.  On page 2, I am reminded why I hate this guy. Observing "while I'm no military tactician," he forgets to point out he was dodging the draft picking flowers in Hawaii while I and others were serving in Vietnam. He then states, "we still had to fight the real war, a guerrilla war--something our nation does not have the stomach for." Oh, please dude, people like you and your followers don't have the guts to serve. Like on page 10, where he forgets that people like Ted Kennedy at least served in the Navy during WWII. You may disagree with his politics, but at least the Kennedys had the guts to serve.  Skip ahead to page 172 (you ain't missing much) for more of his idiocy on Vietnam. He states, about the Vietnamese, that "in the sixties, no one really knew who they were." Well, he didn't, but 3 million Americans who served in the Vietnam War did. That's what happens when you sit out the war of your generation. He also erroneously claims that Vietnam "was a civil war." At the time of the war it was considered communist aggression. Conservatives of the sixties, like me but not him, knew about the communist threat. This is also the same page where Savage-Weiner claims "Iraq was not a civil war." Where have you been lately?  The "Afterword" really says it all. On page 203 he claims, about liberals, "for far too long you have lived in a cage where liberal ideas--and only liberal ideas--are expressed." He is really talking about himself and his followers. At least liberals, by definition, read and review all points.   For all those who hate "liberals," I would like to remind them that our Founding Fathers were the liberals of their day. A real Patriot of our Revolution (one of my real ancestors in Virginia) would have burned his house down and sent him packing on his big honking yacht.   
 Dr. Doolittle fell afoul of the PC police, before they were so named. This edition has been adulterated to maintain political correctness and there is no indication of this unless you read the afterword.  Great story, bad edition 
 Michael Lesy has been fascinated by archives for a long time. His Ph D dissertation led him to "Wisconsin Death Trip," a remarkable testimony.  "Angel's World" is in fact the first chapter of a book formerly released by the same author (in 1985) under the title "Visible Light". In other words, compared to the original version, 3 chapters are now missing. Moreover there is no new light added to the chapter extracted from "Visible Light." The text in "Angel's World" is exactly the same, 26 years later, the images too. The latter were formerly displayed in the form of pseudo-contact sheets; in the new publication each occupies a whole page without any rmarkable improvement in the printing, whic for a photobook, sounds like a disregard of the photographer and the audience.I f you can look for "Visible Light" in your local independent used-book store, or search for it on Amazon 
 I was very excited about this book before I started to read it.  Polk appeared to have flawless credentials...surely someone with so much relevent experience would produce an outstanding book on Iraq.  Unfortunately it became clear very early on in this book that my expectations were not to be met.  Let's start witht the obvious.  The subtitle of this book begins as "the whole sweep of Iraqi history..."  The book is 213 pages and even that can be deceiving...physically, the book is very small and the typesetting appears larger than average.  To be sure, no single book could adequately present the whole sweep of Iraqi history, but of all the Iraqi history books I have read or referenced, this book does the poorest job of all in terms of presenting an overview of the country.  I would recommend Anderson and Stansfield's book as an example of one of the best books in this area.  The way Polk has the book organized, it would be reasonable to have high hopes.  There are six chapters: Ancient Iraq, Islamic Iraq, British Iraq, Revolutionary Iraq, American Iraq, and Whose Iraq?  He appears to have the important bases covered, but within these chapters lies a remarkably weak and half-hearted presentation of Iraq's history, at least at the governmental level.  Another somewhat related criticism would be that there are next to no cited sources in the entire book.  From an academic standpoint, this is baffling.  His experience in the field notwithstanding, it is unacceptable to produce what is to be a serious history book and then provide no sources or bibliography.  The key here is to recognize that at its heart, this book is not an attepmt to provide a history of Iraq, but merely an outlet for criticizing the way the U.S. (particularly Bush) has handled Iraq.  Onto that criticism:  Polk is one of those authors that rightly and (mostly) accurately points out all of the bad things the U.S. has done when it comes to Iraq.  From a moral or humanitarian perspective, of course it's wrong to give support to someone like Hussein.  I think most people would agree with that.  What baffles me is that someone could so passionately point out all these bad things and then be so opposed to a war that ultimately removed a regime who surived up to that point because of what the U.S. had done.  Even though it was not the reason given, the U.S. had accumulated quite a large moral debt to Iraq.  In short, we owed it to Iraqis to get rid of Saddam.  Further explanations of this type of thinking can be found in Feldman's "What we owe Iraq," and Cushman's "A Matter of Principle."  My last main complaint about this book is that for all the criticizing and lamenting about U.S. intentions and mistakes (and believe me, these are all warranted), Polk offers no real ideas for what to do to help Iraqis build a better future, and more importantly, he never even touches on the topic of what kind of life these people would have endured if Hussein was still in power today.  I think it's important and necessary to call the U.S. on its mistakes, but at the end of the day, the U.S. actually helped get rid of a dictator this time.  And even though we owe this to a lot of other countries, I can only be glad that humanitarian and security interests were aligned in this case, and that for all the other problems, there is at least a chance for democracy and a better life in Iraq.  That chance certainly did not exist under Hussein.  The biggest let down here is that it is important for people to understand Iraq, but this book I believe, is doing more harm than good.  If you've done a fair amount of reading on Iraq, this will be clear so that's not the danger here.  What would be an absolute tragedy here would be for someone with no prior experience to pick up this book and then think they have a real understanding of Iraq after reading it.  These are the types of books that make my job as a professor harder than it should be because I have to spend so much time in order to defuse all numbers of students who read material like this and base their opinions and judgements from it.  While not nearly as damaging to the process of education and understanding as Michael Moore or Sean Hannity, it is much more disappointing because Polk has the education and experience needed to produce stellar work.  Framed in those terms, this book is largely a failure 
 While this book may be based, in part, on some reality, their claims of the total amount of gold involved are beyond ridiculous, and completely unsupported, and thus, the book is more likely to be purposful disinformation, or lies put out by the establishment, on purpose, to try and discredit gold as an investment.  The reality is that paper money is the real fraud, based on many frauds such as fractional reserve banking.  The real truth is that central banks have been secretly selling gold for years to suppress gold prices to prop up their paper currencies.  The real stats are that the world has mined about 150,000 tonnes of gold in all of human history, and the world mines about 2500 tonnes per year, and that demand stands at about 5000 tonnes per year.  Central banks have now sold about half of their 30,000 tonnes, and without prior selling of 1500 tonnes of gold per year, the gold price would have been, and will be, much higher.  
 Now, this is not an original work, but borders on plagiarism.  All these phenomenon can be looked up elsewhere.  I have often said, that my gender does not know how to write. They are busy as bees typing away like crazy but untalented secretaries. They are housewife-cook-book-style-authors at best! What Sylvia calls her research, I call just look it up in Fact Monster on the Internet! Her guide Francine is uttlery not believable with her commonplace statements and has to be a fiction of Sylvia's imagination. Read it yourself and find out!  
 Chomsky main failing in this work and it appears to be a recurring theme in his 40 year career as a propagandist, is he begins with a typical theory: America is bad and all that it does is bad, finds information to corroborate this through a creative process of distorting sources or failing to mention them all together, and ignoring anything that might deconstruct his theme. Despite Chomsky's belief that Bin Laden's attacks were driven by US foreign policy, all one has to do is go to the source, whom Chomsky believes can be taken at his word, to realize the goals of Bin Laden.   All actions taken by Bin Laden and his organization have this specific and narrow goal: to re-create the Islamic Caliphate that existed centuries ago and basing it on Shari'a. It is driven by a chauvinistic belief that "Dar es Harb" does not deserve its prosperity and "Dar es Salam" deserves to take its rightful place of power on the world stage. Realistically, the only thing standing in the way of the recreation of the Caliphate is the United States and the force it can project to prevent this, and that's why Bin Laden believes it needs to be destroyed. One does not even have to stoop to Chomsky's level of vile intellectual dishonesty to make this point, Bin Laden's own words are very clear on this.   "the pious Caliphate will start from Afghanistan"  This is Bin Laden's reason for 9/11, everything else from the Palestinian issue to Iraq, to Saudi Arabia is a pile on to garner him mainstream support, but his core ideology a, Shari'a governed Islamic Caliphate, is what motivates his backers, allies. and foot soldiers.   Chomsky confidence that he understands everything that motivated Bin Laden, is more a projection of his own beliefs, ideology and motivations for wanting to see America destroyed than Bin Laden's motivations. Chomsky on September 11th is like someone who, upon hearing that Reagan was shot, immediately launches into a ten-minute tirade  about the Contras, Cuba, Palestine, Vietnam (etcetera), only to be told that was all about Jodie Foster.  His analysis, if that's what one could call this tripe, about Bin Laden also repeats the often told lie that Bin Laden was involved with the US during the 80's in Afghanistan. The Mujahideen were split into 6 different factions , three of which were hardliner Islamists : Islamic Party , Islamic society , Islamic Unity and three moderate factions : Islamic Revolutionary Movement , National Islamic Front , and National Liberation Front . None of these factions were led by Bin Laden and not all them were supplied by America, the hardliners were supplied by Pakistan , Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Don't believe it, look up Rober Fisk's interview with Bin Laden in 1988 where Bin Laden categorically denies that he took any assistance from the US during the Afghan Jihad.   If you want to know who Bin Laden is read Michael Scheuer, if you want to know what drives him, read Daniel Pipes, and if you want a poor alternative for toilet paper read Chomsky.  
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 Let me start off, by saying that I am a huge Dean Koontz fan, especially of his work in the 80's and 90's when he really blew up. So, when you read this review, don't think that I'm an ignorant hater. Because I am not. I just give you my thoughts about this book. Here goes:  Y'all know what the book is about so I am not going to repeat it all over again. Jimmy Tock and the 5 horrible days that he will meet throughout his life.  I thought the book was awful and most of all- ridiculous. And I will tell you why. There was no credibility in the characters whatsoever. Usually DK does a great job in creating credible characters. Well, he totally blew it this time. Why? Because ALL of the characters are acting like idiot. There is NO WAY that Jimmy, his wife Lorrie, and his familly can act with so much humour in every single situation. Every single time Jimmy and his wife face a horrible situation, their worst enemies and when they are close to dying, it seems like they've got something funny and sophisticated to say. I mean, come on! That's just stupid! You're one step away from getting killed and all you can do is tell jokes and act like an idiot? That was totally annoying! All throughout the book, jokes and jokes in the worst situation. I know it's just a book of fiction, but the characters still need to be believable. Well, in this book, they ARE NOT.   The plot itself isn't so bad, but it's not good either. Especially the last few chapters, where everything is getting clearer - well the end doesn't make a lot of sense either, and it's like Koontz made an end for little kids or teenagers who haven't read a lot of books and don't know what a good book is. The end, when they meet their worst enemy is almost like the end of a soap opera - an ending that doesn't really make sense (and of course you get a lot of those stupid supposed-to-be-sophisticated jokes from the annoying Tock familly).  So, I am sorry for ripping this book appart, but to me it was a piece of trash. I just had to read it till the end, because I was on a vacation in Thailand and I couldn't find a good book at that time. Plus I wanted to see how low DK could go. It seemed (at least on that book) that he was tired of writing long books with a lot of developements and he just rushed this book with its ridiculous characters. 2 stars and that's generous of me. A waste of time. Get DK's books from the 80's and 90's instead 
 Ill start on a more positive note: this book has a few neat things in it.  Like all the "complete" books, it has a smattering of prestige and base classes, and a few among these shine.  A verbatum set of words can be applied to the feat section as well, but the rest of the book, is pure bilge between two stiff pieces of cardboard.  The lack of inspiration is just the surface: Most of the material is transposed from older supplements, and most of that has been updated nicely, but the new stuff within it just simply falls flat in the balance, and concept department, the two most shameless of these being the tactical feats, and the hulking hurlur prestige class.  Tactical feats are like normal feats, only you get the equivalent of 3 feats! The shameless lack of thought in planning such a thing makes ones head spin. The weapon style feats also feature such innovative techniques as "Axe and Dagger", a popular mongolian fighting style for the truly moronic.   The worst of it is the Hulking hurler: a 3 level prestige class thats let you throw stuff really hard. 50+d6 hard if you sink a lot of gold into strength boosts.  A couple of my friends hero arena'd this at level 10, and the Hurlur took out two red dragons turn one.   Just when you thought the book couldnt get any worse, you flip to a section which explains how to effectivly make a character based of previous campaigns your DM has run. If you buy this book, smear whiteout or something similar over the title of this section, and ink in the real title: "MetaGaming, and How to Do It"  In closing, dont get this book.  The material within can be found quite readilly in other books, and the new stuff will only be allowed by the most incompetant of DM 
 I was required to purchase this book for a class I am currently taking. While the content of the book could be useful, the manner in which it is written is laden with ridiculous run-on ideas that could be communicated much more clearly. Here is an example from page 28:  "Regardless of the extent to which teachers decide to adapt to the norms and parenting styles of their student's culture or systematically assists students in learning to adapt while maintaining their cultural values, the point is that as educators we are willing to examine our own beliefs and way of working with students in light of the contextual variables existing in the classroom, school and community."  To students who may be required to read this text: Good luck. Perhaps you can change classes before it is too late.  To professors who may add this book to their required reading list:  Please, please, please pass on this text and choose something more relevant and tangible for your students.  To educators who may choose this book to answer questions or add to their professional library: choose something else. This book is useless. My advice is your time will be better spent going to talk to teachers who have been in the field rather than reading this book.

 It's not just that If lucy Fell is a bad film. 90% of what comes out of Hollywood is uninspired, formulaic dross just like it, and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it. What makes this movie memorably, remarkably bad is writer/director/star Eric Schaeffer's nauseatingly immense sense of self-regard, which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday's roadkill. The mere fact that the photogenically-challenged Mr. Schaeffer should have the likes of Elle MacPherson tell him he's "cute" speaks volumes 
 I cannot believe that people mistake these sort of trendy gimmicks like hypnosis for serious therapy. Forty years of outcome research shows that the therapeutic relationship, client characteristics and extratherapeutic events are what produce change in clients. Placebo effect has been found to be an important factor in promoting successful change as well, and in this light, hypnosis, EMDR and other snake oil cures might have some benefit. They do not belong in an ethical or serious providers office otherwise. The book provides no outcome studies or research that shows the efficacy of the voodoo being prescribed. I believe that hypno-"therapy" is often used by clincians who are unable or unwilling to make the close human connections required for truly effective therapy. For those who do not have human skills, finger waving or clock watching is the ticket. The book is also not well written: perhaps the lack of interest it generates in the reader is intentional. I, for one, felt like I had fallen into a deep sleep while reading about the seemingly endless, mechanical techniques. In conclusion, unless you have a wobbly table or need a cure for insomnia, save your money and buy a well-written book that offers some hope of change written by a therapist with concerns for his human clients, like Scott Miller or Albert Ellis 
 There's a wealth of fascinating, behind-the-scenes detail to this book, but on the whole I found too many instances where the author was plugging the gaps with his own imagination. Unbiased works about Nixon are hard to find, and I didn't find one here. It would be refreshing to come across a text that seeks neither to vilify nor redeem Nixon's public image. Perhaps, given the damage he did to political idealism in this country, it simply isn't possible to approach him without an agenda. Or maybe we just need more time to go by before we try to digest his impact on American life 
  So they invented drum'n'bass. They define it as being Bossa Nova with a new beat. I tell you it's nothing at all. I think they could add new material to it if they really wanted to create something new.  What's wrong here is to find that this is a new way of playing and feeling Bossa Nova. No, not absolutely, this is not Bossa Nova.  Repertoire is good Brazilian music. Voice is fine crystal.  Unfortunately this 'drum'n'bass' ensemble is just a passing wave.  Ms. Gilberto owes us something better 
 This book provides a ton of good examples and solutions to help you master the subject matter.  However, there are so many errors in the examples and problem sets, that you'll pull your hair out wondering if you're wrong or if the book's wrong (most likely, the book is wrong).  No errata section on the website either to clarify 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 I just spent the past half hour crying while chopping my onions by hand.  Why is that you may ask?  Because I ordered this darn product A MONTH AGO and it STILL HASN'T SHOWN UP!!! If you choose to buy this product definately don't get it from the "offical site".  I called the number provided twice and was given 2 different dates that this wonderful product supposedly shipped.  I read some other reviews that had the same complaint.  I'm already not happy due to this fiasco.  I've ordered products from other countries that shipped faster than this stinker 
 I purchased this product along with the Koi and turtle and they worked for one day. The koi would not turn off unless the batteries were pulled out. The turtle would not turn on unless you physically held the button in and the fish just quit altogether and sunk to the bottom of the pool. 
 I am so appalled that I contributed even one penny to this blatently anti-semitic, history denying xenophobe.  I only wish I could rate this a zero.  This book incites hatred and paranoia against everything Jewish.  He buys into every nazi and neo-nazi theory denying the ethnic and historic origins of the Jewish people. He refers to the holocaust as the "so-called holocaust."  Jews are simply Khazars from Russia who are removing native Palestinians from their land.  (Yes, I was already aware of this theory that has been amply and roundly refuted). He  makes the patently absurd claim that Christianity is the only religion that represents the Old Testament creed of Yahweh. (And makes no effort to prove it--He only goes into  talmudic "examinations" which are totally one sided.  Of course I doubt the authenticity of many of his talmudic quotes at all, but I am aware that the talmud contains everything "and its opposite." He doesn't bother quoting the opposite sentiments. I only wish someone had warned me about the content of this book before I bought it. I only hope that people will realize this author does not represent what true Christians believe. This guy is scary.  
 The language in this "novel" is so pretentious and convoluted as to be largely unreadable by the average reader. It seems that James never met a comma he didn't like, and uses them to imbed all sorts or modifiers and asides. Although the graduate students may attach some deeper meaning to this, I suspect he really didn't have a clear idea of anything he wanted to say so he simply rambled on. At least with Faulkner there is a payoff. With James, all the language covolutions lead to nothing in the way of action. Random House must have had a large,unsold inventory of this book ( not surprising) so they included it in their top 100 list. James has single-handedly ruined my project of reading the all of the top 100. I will not, cannot, albeit I would like to, read,with any pleasure, the other two James books, novels perhaps, on the list, the Random House list that is 
 I did have to buy this book for a class and I view it as a total waste.  It is just another self help book...if you wish to stray away from the reality of life and have something to blame your problems on this is the book for you 
 I found this book entirely lame.  I am surprised that the same person who wrote Blind Assasin (Booker Prize) wrote this.  Most of the plot was left hanging in the air witih no explanation at all.  Sex scenes were fortuitous - thrown in where the timing required it.  I did not like the main character.  I don't think she learned anything from her adventures or grew as a person.  I see nothing at all to recommed this book.  Irritating from beginning to end 
 The first 2 books in Lackey's Dragonjouster series were excellent.  The author created a new world, new scenarios, new theme and did them well.  Imagine my surprise when I read 'Sanctuary' the third installment in this series.  It seems that the author, after throwing herself fully into the first 2 books, has lost interest in them and was mainly just trying to tie up as many loose ends as possible and finish the series.  'Sanctuary' could have been a satisfying end to Vetch/Kiron's story...as it was, I was left wanting... 
 And also gave my children an amusing exhibition of what it was like to try to tune in a station on a TV circa 1963.  Pulled in weak signals from about 3 stations 18 miles from NYC broadcast towers. 
 The author denies that your thyroid problem is your own fault, telling you you need to get involved with all the medical aspects and tell your doctor what you need.  If your doctor doesn't listen to you then find another doctor.  Monitor your TC levels through blood tests (if/when you can afford them).  Then the last chapter is all about how much Thyroid therapy can help (as in 12 step programs) to discover that your stresses and life problems probably started the whole thing in the first place.  Athough it is NOT YOUR fault.  All the while insinuating that it, in fact, IS your fault.  Weird book.  I would NOT recommend it unless you're very young and have never heard of a 12 step program and have 24/7 hours a day to monitor your progress.  Then, go for it.  Otherwise, find a better alternative.  
 I should have read the other review more closely. This is a good blanket for HOT summer nights! I believe it is too light for cold winter nights. I expected more for over $50. If I didn't return it it would have made a nice decorative throw! The color and texture are nice 
 This author is obviously very well versed in alot of material as you know from everything he has written.  He remarks that he will only use from acupuncture what is real and forget the hocus/pocus.  I feel that Mr Chaitow highly underestimates the powers of acupuncture medicine. I am a western trained physician who has just trained in this ancient wonderful world of acupunture. There is no methodical or conceptual description for point selection, but a mere lists of points for pain in areas of the body. For headaches-points A,B & C. For backpain--points X,Y & Z, etc.  I have no regrets in the purchase, but I like it only to supplement my other material 
 This could have been a very good documentary, but the video editing style made it unwatchable for me.  The camera never stays on any subject for more than 5 seconds, film is sped up and slowed down for no apparent reason, and bright flashes of light with loud sound effects highlight the transition from scene to scene.  The events surrounding 9/11 are fully capable of engaging my attention without this in-your-face style of presentation, which ironically dilutes the overall impact of the film 
 shipment is excellent, but...the CD-ROM is not working... I need to replace it ASAP! Whatshould I do 
 If you like the idea of naked men with each other putting you to sleep. . . no not to bed to SLEEP get this DVD!!!!!!!!! 
 I am so sorry that I bought this book.  It is unfortunate that you do not have a Penguin or Everyman's Library edition.  First of all the book is too large to read in bed.  Secondly, whoever did the proofreading should be fired.  There are so many typographical errors that it really upsets and disturbs the reading.  If the postage were not so expensive from Israel, I would return the book to Amazon 
 Thankfully this was not the first CD I bought by this artist - it was not a big hit with me. The work on this album can not compare to the other CD's he has released since. His other CD's have converted me to country music  and convinced me that Tracy Lawrence is the very best. He has only improved  over time- - like a fine wine 
 On page 40 she states, "55% of patients reported that bran made their IBH worse and yet the 1st recipe in "20 Recipe You Cannot Live Without" is Raisin Bran Muffins! Whereas in the definitive book on IBS "Eating for IBS" says stay away from whole wheat, milk, cheese, and red meat (which I followed and it solved our IBS problem), this book pushes whole wheat, whole milk, eggs, and dairy.  "Eating for IBS" helped. Following the recipes in this book would not

 I agree with the music fan from Fredericksburg, Virginia.  I own most if not all of Alan Jackson's albums. I couldn't believe my ears. Alan Jackson should apologize to his fans for this one. The title should have been "LIVIN' ON MY NAME." This album also provided an answer to the question of "WHO'S CHEATIN' WHO." In fact, Alan deserves a call and a visit from Roy D. Mercer. This is the worst country music album I have purchased in 35 years. Pass on this album 
 cons tips extremely easy on carpet and if you have a lot of cds stacked at the top  poorly designed, it is a vertical cd rack that doesnt have individual slots for cds, so if you want a cd from the bottom of a stack you have basically pull the whole stack to get to it  putting it together was a pain, the one i bought i had to break a piece of metal just to fit it in its guide holes.  again..poorly designed... doesnt even fit cds that well, there are gaps, and the cd casses are loose fitting  pros .......... i guess it can hold a lot of cds.... 
 "The spy who loved me" is the oddest of Ian Fleming's Bond novels. It is basically the slightly risqué (for the time) story of the sexual awakening of a girl, Vivienne Michel (the story is told through her eyes and Fleming even credits her with co-authorship of the book). James Bond? He turns up about half-way through the book to rescue her from a couple of baddies at a motel in which she is working and share his, er, experience of life with her.  So, what has this to do with this film? They have in common the title and a character called James Bond; there all resemblance ends. In this regard, it's a bit like the Fleming Bond short story "Octopussy", which shares the same fate.   The film has thus to stand on its own merits, of which there are precisely none. This is the most appalling hokum, silly story, woodenly acted by Roger Moore (who did once have the honesty to say that his acting talents went all the way from A very nearly to B) and others. Now I know that the Bond films are not really meant to be nerve-tingling thrillers, because you know that our hero and his panoply of ever more absurd gadgets is indestructible and equal to anything, but are more droll comedies with miscellaneous stunts and explosions thrown in, but I didn't find this one funny at all. (Makes solemn resolution never again to watch any more Bonds in which Roger Moore appears). 
 I own parrots, I have friends who own parrots, and I have a brother who breeds parrots.  I feel I can knowledgably say that this is not a good guide to parrots.  It is full of mistakes both in the text and in the illustrations.  I was very disappointed when I went through this book and, fortunately, I did not buy it but got it through the library.  If you want info about this group of birds buy the standard, Forshaw's Parrots of the World, and just realize that the information about ranges and scientific names might be out-of-date but overall this is the better book by far.  It deserves no stars 
 Zero Stars!  I am the parent of a multi racial child and I am on the Cultural Diveristy Board for my son's School.  This is the book that they want to use!  I am so repulsed by the lies, hypocrasy, and the lack of sceintific methodology I am just sick and taking action.  This book is written by an academic professional white person hater in the "Good African American vs Evil White power, white domination style"  That allows any non white person,  complete relief of any misdeeds or personal failure due to racism- real or percieved.  Like my son only had to be on the look out for white people who are racist and he'll be fine.  I have shown this book to engineers, lawyers, accountants, management personel and doctors - of all colors and back grounds, and even the ones who were inclined to agree with the intent of the book, couldn't support it.  The author uses twisted academic bs to try to make a point.   For example "Racism is bias combined with power?" vs the dictionary "Racism is the belief in ethnic superiority"  Why give racism more power unless you have a motive?  And  If I have a manager whom I have no power over and I call them them a racial slur, then according to this book it's not a racial slur because I have no power over this person.  WTF?  I could go on but who has the time?  Please know this.  This is rubbish written by a race profiteer who has to keep black people down so she can still make money.  Nothing more.  
 A short book, but too long.  Read like a tract and could have been presented in a long pamphlet.  I generally like Yancey, but you can skip this and re-read WHAT'S SO AMAZING ABOUT GRACE. My favorite 
 The title of this book is very intriguing and the subject of learning how to improve communication skills when things are rough is very compelling.  I was astonished and very dissapointed with the author's approach - so much so, that I was not able to make it past page 35.  I would not have made the expenditure had I known that the author created a platform for her philosophy of relationships.  Had that been my interest at the time, there are far more interesting treatises on the subject.  I rate this book as a 1 because there isn't a lower number 
 Got to the 11th chapter before giving up on this Confederacy apologist film.  Sorry, but don't see slaveholders in a good light.  As a Black female, I will always root for the "Federals".  It took another 100 plus years for freedom for Blacks in the South after the end of the Civil War, so I don't really see the need for movies that show the "humanity" of Southerners who fought tooth and nail for breaking up this nation so they could continue slavery.  Anyway, this is not a movie for progressive minded folks.  I'm sure there are movies such as Glory, which are not on the wrong side of history.  Nuff said 
 I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THIS BOOK. I WANTED TO PUT IT DOWN AND NOT PICK IT UP EVER AGAIN, BUT ONCE I START READING A BOOK I HAVE TO FINSH IT. FIRST SHE WAS TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM HER PAST, THEN I DONT KNOW WHY HER HUSBAND STAYED WITH HER. SHE MADE ME SICK AND I LIKED HER SISTER MORE THAN HER. I WAS KIND OF HOPING THAT HER HUSBAND WOULD HAVE LEFT HER FOR HER SISTER INSTEAD OF STAYING WITH HER. ERIC JEROME DICKEY HAS BEEN SLIPPING IN HIS LAST FEW BOOKS I HOPE THE NEXT TWO COMING OUT THIS YEAR WILL BE BETTER. ASHLEY 
 It's so unreal to me that someone would write this balderdash! How can they prey on innocent people who have a hard enough time dealing with their very serious, life threatening allergies. This genre of books is very uncool 
 This book looks like it is a compilations from older black and white photographs with a few newer color photographs.  While the stitches look interesting and many are clear and easy to see, too many of them are colorized from black and white photographs. Most importantly, these original photographs were not clear to begin with, so the colorizing obscures them further. 
 First listen: " What?...Just "My favourite Game" is good? no, here must be another good song" Second: "Ok, now i know this is a waste of time" third: " Do you believe" "Junk of the Hearts" " Erase/Rewind" and maybe just maybe "Paralized" could be so-so tracks. CONCLUSION: I want my money back. The entired cd is so slow, calm, and i was waiting some strong tracks, whit fast rythms...but i got this. Nina Person ( The blond singer) have a nice voice, but whit this album i was fooled like a tourist in a foreing land 
 I LOVE Christmas.  I love the festive atmosphere.  I love the spirit of giving and I love Christmas music.  This stuff, however, is downright painful to listen to.  A few tracks, with the slower tempo, can be tolerated in small doses, but the more "upbeat" number are too awash in synthesizer arrangements and come across as little more than "a disco Christmas" and severely test my love for the music of the season.  Destined for shopping mall PA systems everywhere 
 I bought this book, thinking the same as another reviewer, that it would be about DETAILS, not basic stuff.  I was extremely disappointed.  This is good for high school students or a high school guidance office, but it's not useful for someone who is starting out of college with a professional career.  A MUCH better choice would be The New Women's Dress For Success, by Molloy.  This book was extremely thin, 64 pages, and overpriced.  I paid much less for a different book that was MUCH more informative and helpful 
      "Indie" is a word typically used to justify subpar music that nobody could like otherwise. Call something "Indie", and I guarantee some schmuck in a Starbucks will be all over it and praising it as the masterpiece it never deserved to be called. They'll equate the young musician to Bon Dylan if he happens to play an acoustic (no matter how inadequately the guitar is played). Apparently to many of the people here, anything on an acoustic is Folk.   Don't get me wrong, I like a lot of Beck's music (most of Mellow Gold and all of Odelay), but when you unplug Beck and take away his nifty studio tricks (turntable scratching and studio gloss), you've just got one big mess on your hands. There's no question about it: Beck is a media darling, and in the eyes of Indie fanboys Rock critics for the likes of Rolling Stone, he can do no wrong, no matter how awful an album he puts out. Case in point: This monstrosity on an "album". I could create a better album than this if somebody gave me two cardboard boxes to bang on and an out-of-tune guitar with only three strings. Those were what Beck used for this album, right? Beck probably tells detractors his "quirky" lyrics can make up for the abysmal execution of these songs, but this just isn't true. The squeaky vocals are annoying, the random blathering of nonsensical words is stupid, and the poor quality of said vocals and lyrics should be enough to keep people from blowing their cash on this dud. But it doesn't. Because it's Indie. What a waste. Knowing there were talented Folk musicians out there that were passed over in favor for this sh*t is just plain sad. Remember, not everything on an acoustic is Folk, you Indie elitists. And you guys say you hate being labeled... 
 Isn't it fishy that this book was reviewed by 3 people, each within 2 days of the other, posting nearly the same glowing "review" (5 stars of course) and not one of these 3 reviewers have voiced an opinion on any other book, at any other time before or after this book? How cheezy.  Like the one "real" reviewer, I also thought this book was textbookish and read more like a term paper for a community college class, only with about 80,000 too many words 
 By arguing that human rights comes from some vague concept of "dignity" and "familiarity" rather than sentience and feeling, Fukuyama brings to mind the European colonists who considered Africans no more than "common beasts." His philosophy, although argued in a tone that seems reasonable, is at turns startingly narrow-minded and genetically-racist. Not reccomended: readers should look otherwheres for a more balanced and less judgemental review of biotechnology and ethics 
 This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie of all time, and unfortunately I was trying to save a few dollars by buying the cheaper one, big mistake!  This thing will hardly play at all, very poor quality image.  It is not worth the disk it's on.  Now I have to get the remastered one anyway, sigh.  Lesson learned 
 The size is good but the second one we ordered leaked. The cap did not fit... The after taste is not so strong but very difficult to see the difference from an ordinary stainless steel container/warmer which costs only $6-$10 dollars in the market around. Too pricy and the thin plastic cap does not match well with the product 
 I had, repeat had been reading this magazine for ten years or so. Over that time they have really changed. I guess it started when they got a new editor four or five years ago. After that the adds changed from building suppliers to lexus ads. I don't like seeing automotive and home stereo ads in my how-to magazine. The information is more akin to Martha Stewart than it is Norm Abrams. Who by the way is hardly in there anymore if at all. Not to mention the new guy, A stray they picked up from ask this old house, what an opie taylor he is. What makes him eligible to write something for TOH magazine. I really miss Steve Thomas. The how-to's though somewhat informative really lack the intricate details. All I can say is thank god Tom Silva still puts in some minutia of his wealth of information. If you'd like a "Better Homes and Gardens plus magazine" then this magazines for you if you want to learn something try Fine Homebuilding or at the least Family Handyman 
 Such a disappointment! I had been hearing about the glamorous, scandalous, sexy Mitford sisters for years -- Jessica the fiery and sexy Communist, Unity the glamorous and sexy she-Nazi, Diana the sleek and sexy fascist, Debo the demure and sexy duchess, and (last but not least) Nancy the sly and sexy writer of satirical novels. So when I got the chance at last to read LOVE IN A COLD CLIMATE I was expecting something like the sisters themselves were supposed to be -- sly and sexy, elegant and aristocratic.   Wrong, wrong, wrong! Who'd a thunk it? The low down here is that Nancy Mitford hates sex -- terrified of it. Finds normal men frightening and repulsive, yet has quite a soft spot for elderly gay men who wear lipstick and makeup and lounge around in women's dressing gowns. Creepy, creepy, creepy. You can see now why no one in the family thought it odd when sister Unity fell in love with Adolph Hitler!  Oh, and the satire -- where is it? Almost nothing in this book really addresses class issues in a meaningful way. There are no direct confrontations between the aristocrats and the wealthy industrial class -- much less the working poor. There's a bit of snide gossip, but again it's served cold. No sexy scandals, just bizarre and faintly repulsive stories about people who are far too creeped out by the human body to ever feel anything for anybody but themselves.   Somewhere in Nancy Mitford's life, there must have been a lot of pain. Pain in big buckets, Eugene O'Neill style family in agony type pain. But sadly, she never turned her tortured family past into a deep feeling masterpiece like LONG DAYS JOURNEY INTO NIGHT. Instead she just played it safe, writing cold and shallow novels like this one.   So sad! 
 I used to love SB novels, but the last few have been so very disappointing and "Into the Storm" is, by far, the worst.  There is no character development so we don't understand why couples who are formed in the book would be attracted to each other.  Basically, they've known each other, at best, casually through work - they sleep together - having the most amazing sex ever! and they suddenly decide they care deeply about each other.  Hmmm, that may work at 17, but the characters are in their late 20s and early 30s.  They have very responsible, professional careers and by now, should know that love is based on far more than casual sex.    The situations SB keeps coming up with are becoming more and more amateurish and bizarre.  All of these factors caused me to quickly lose interest in the book and I began skimming pages hoping that something, somewhere would grab my attention.  No such luck.  I used to love reading SB novels.  I couldn't wait for new books to be published and I'd stay up late into the night reading.  No more.  In fact, I think I'm done with Brockmann.  Granted, I never read SB for the suspense.  I loved the character development, the character interaction and the adventure that made sense to the story.  If I want suspense, which appears to be where SB would rather go these days, I'd much rather spend my time and money reading Tess Gerritsen or Karin Slaughter.  They do suspense so much better 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Only with great difficulty could one improve upon the May 1, 2005 Amazon review of this book by W. Christie -- a thoroughly competent and even brilliant review. But some readers may not have the patience to read through it.  Therefore in this review allow me simply to summarize the gist of this book's core fallacy, a fallacy so central and deeply fundamental that it discredits the entire book.  This core, devastating error is that Braden childishly ties together (a) letters used to represent DNA coding (which originated with scientists using English, which is not related to Hebrew), (b) the Hebrew name of God, (c) the order of letters in the Hebrew alphabet, and (d) the abject nonsense of numerology, which has been repeatedly and thoroughly discredited scientifically!   My Ph.D. is in linguistics, and I have provided professional instruction in Hebrew and other semitic languages. The order of letters in any language with an alphabetic writing system is essentially arbitrary. Additionally, to choose Hebrew as the "God language" is to ignore the history of how the Torah (that Christians call Old Testament) was assembled at various times by different writers, then back-dated with the claim that it was written by Moses.  Braden's entire book, therefore, is squarely centered upon the most blatant linguistic and historical nonsense, compounded by the ridiculousness of numerological claptrap. 
 I don't like her routine in this DVD at all.  I don't like the strechie.  It's a completely waste and it won't give you the same workout as hand weights or balance ball.  I solde the DVD the 2nd day I bought it.  However, I do like her 'Shrink Your Female Fat Zone,' which uses dumbell and balance for upper body, lower body and abs 
 This book has a great shape which my 18 month old loves to hold, and great photos, but as far as a potty training book goes, you can do much better.  Once Upon a Potty is probably the best one out there, though it's kind of a long story and my daughter won't sit through it.  Still, it has a good amount of detail to it.  My daughter's favorite potty training book is by far A Potty for Me! by Karen Katz.  Just the right amount of detail with nice pictures and a great story.  So what's wrong with My Potty Book?  It's too simple.  It shows a bunch of kids playing with a potty, then they sit on it then it tells them to wee, use toilet paper, wash their hands and they're done.  It's almost too simple even for a child.  Every other potty book I've looked at deals a little with the anxiety that a child might feel.  The two other books I mentioned explain how babies use nappies, and then when they're ready, they move onto a potty.  They try it, but it might not feel right.  They try and try and after some practice and patience, they finally use the potty.  Both are very cute, sweet and supportive.  My First Potty Book is more like a collection of photos of kids playing with potties with a few lines of text thrown in.  If you're hoping this will be your only potty training book, I think you will be very disappointed 
 I have listened to a bunch of Dean Koontz books. While listening to the second one I saw so many similarities, which really turned me off. And this flaw continued which each book I listen to, which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book. However, most of the stories were pretty good so I stuck with him.  This is not the case with this book.  "Cold Fire" is absolutely horrible.  I so regret purchasing this book.  It is so bad that I have decided to swear off Dean for looooooooong while.  Just on a side note, "The Bad Place" is the first DK book I read and it was very entertaining. 
 This book is quite a disappointment. I wanted to read the book through but I just couldn't get myself to finish it. I'll illustrate why:  It's written very badly. If you've ever read the outside of a bottle of Dr. Bronner's soap, you'll know the basic style. Take that mess of sentence making, mash it together with the story-telling method of a 3 year old and crush it under a heaping sack of gluttony glorification and sketchy opinions masked as facts... then you're a little closer to Postrel's performance in this book. I'll attempt to emulate: "Stuff is happening! Blaaaahhhh! There's this and stuff and this and that and stuff and and and it's SO GREAT that we think we're so rich and we can buy everything from brand names and this unrelated person said that and this and other random people said other things I can jumble into how I love not thinking about anything beyond the surface of magazine articles and corporate marketing is so great and people LIKE it! Blaah!" Other irritants include her frequent use of listing in paragraph form, rapid-fire name dropping and quoting of unintroduced people, deceptive use of the english language, jumbled or contradictory anecdotes, and not concluding the inklings of any point. Her writing gets less frantic the farther she goes but it doesn't ever reach a point at which I would call 'good' or even 'skilled'. Doing spot checks throughout the remainder of the text reveals nothing more than a slower pace of stream of consciousness without conscience.  An organized thought? Cohesion? Sorry.. The chapters I read contained no structure, no organization of thought, no points of cohesion throughout their entirety. If there was a point behind the apparent meaning of each word in series, I must have missed it. Because as far as I could tell, everything was face value and no further.. and that face is an ugly portrait of average, current mass-media writing. It's almost as if Postrel is not really a human but a author simulator, programmed to take magazine archive keyword searches and mash them chaotically together with marketing slop and corporate praise. A human would take all that data and assemble it into a flow of thoughts, reflections and deeper postulations to form a book. A badly written software program though, would do as she has done and vomit a number of barely formed paragraphs of pseudo-speak into a large number of random pages. Don't believe me? Go to any one page, anywhere in the book and start reading. Do so again. It's the same effect as starting at the beginning and reading the pages in numeric order. Maybe she IS just a computer program. Her picture in the back certainly looks like a stock photo. Wouldn't surprise me a bit.  The point of view is seriously out of touch. Her angle of attack in this book seems to be written by someone who doesn't exist outside of what other people are writing and saying in popular media. In her fantasy world, all Americans are rich, we love corporate marketing and we don't notice or care about why things are made in China, why people are poor and starving, or why anyone should care about anything that isn't a famous person or a name brand.  Her stance is very pro aristocrat I personally am offended with her glorification of all things aristocratic. In the same way it's not nice to give praise to bullies, I don't appreciate tone of her statements writing off origins and consequences of americorp imperialist dominance as fine and dandy. Everything beyond that it seems, is not worthy of her attention. For the sake of a book like this though, it should be. Her bias causes the book to fail yet again because it NEVER DOES grapple any substance within the plasticine fantasy vapor of what she defines as style. She just cheers the bullies of industry from the insidious sidelines of pretentiousness. Her only goal past that seems to be circuitous statements trying to convince you that all of that is okay 
 Like many things from the Certified Fraud Examiners, this book comes with a hefty price tag.    The book is alright but it is definitly not worth 100 dollars.    If you have read a few other good books about fraud (books by Chuck Whitlock, Frank Abagnale, Carl Sifakis) then you will find that less than 1/4 of the information in this book is new.  Since it is written by an accountant, it is not as enjoyable or readable as most books out there.    Furthermore, anyone who as ever changed font sizes, page margins, fonts, and line spacing to make a boring term paper meet the minimum requirements will notice that this 'encyclopedia' is double spaced and the inner margins are massive.  In fact, the inner page margins are more than twice the size of the margins in 'Frauds, Deceptions and Swindles' by Cark Sifakis.    If this book had normal margins and single spacing its 840+ pages would probably shrink to approximately 350 pages.    If you are willing to spend 100 dollars on books about fraud, you'd be better off buying a smorgasborg of used books by Whitlock, Abagnale, Sifakis, and whatever else the Amazon AI recommends.  
 Native Tongue  by Carl Hiaasen   This book is fast paced, has a lot of energy, and a zany weirdness.  No doubt, it is a page-turner.  And it is better than the other book of Hiaasen's I have read, Double Whammy.  But all that does not a good read make...  A strength of Hiaasen's books are his characters, well defined and numerous.  Most are straightforward stereotypes, from the out-of-luck journalist-turned-publicist, the vapid sex-phone girlfriend, a steroid-doped strongman, the crude-and-sleazy millionaire bad-guy, a muscular-but-clear-minded black good-guy cop, to the dumb-but-intrinsically good-guy burglars, and loads of redneck Florida "crackers".  Hiaasen makes this cast interesting by having them jump through zany hoops, and by casting two characters that are quite original, an environmentally-militant 70+ aged woman, and an environmentally-crazed former-governor-gone-wildman.  And we meet psychotic whales and sex-starved dolphins.  Etc. etc.  So what's wrong.  Mainly, it's that the book stays at a level of TV-sitcom-gone-book.  It achieves zero depth in dealing with any subject.  One might think that the exception is the environment, but the story is so inane that it cannot achieve traction even here.  So perhaps Native Tongue is just pure entertainment?  If you like brainless action, gratuitous violence, gross humor, and zany "fun", Native Tongue might satisfy.    I have one additional problem with Hiassen, and it's similar to the problem I so often have with Michael Crichton.  These books stink of hypocrisy.  Crichton makes a (seriously good) living off nifty science ideas while constantly bashing that same science.  Hiassen's heroes work hard to rise out of the trash heap of modern society, but Hiaasen's writing routinely wallows in that same trash heap for supposed laughs and zaniness.   While I enjoyed a few sections of Native Tongue, I had no doubts at the end that I had wasted many hours that should have been better spent 
 The acting in this is fine;  Lange is delectably sultry, Jones is excellent as a washed-up drunk.  But the accent Rip Torn uses in this has got to be the worst Southern accent ever committed to film (and that includes Kevin Costner's execrably awful accent in Oliver Stone's 'JFK').  Sounds like Foghorn Leghorn channelling Leon Redbone.  I broke up laughing at how bad it was.  Agreed, this is much better than the Taylor-Newman-Ives Hollywood piece.  But viewers might want to check out the version made with Olivier as Big Daddy, Natalie Wood as Maggie and Robert Wagner as Brick.  Excellent all around, and Olivier sounds much more like an arrogant Southern planter than Rip Torn does.  At least you're not laughing at it 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 Actually, I couldn't even get all the way through.  It should be called "The Thoroughly Shallow Married Girl."  It's not even clever enough to by kitsch.  You could fit all the valuable or entertaining info in this book on one side of an index card 
 Although I loved For Planets and Kings, and looked forward to reading Blue River, I found it tedious and monotonous. I thought the character development was limited and I didn't feel the involvement as I did with the  character's in Canin's other book 
 I feel for the HSPs in the world.  In many respects, I am one.  However, this book had a pervasive pointlessness to it.  Despite the promising title, the book offers little of substance.  What's worse, it thoroughly confounds two separate traits: emotional sensitivity and sensitivity to one's environment.  The two are vastly different and jamming them into one trait, "sensitive," misses much ground for exploration.  I was excited to start the book the first time I started it...and I never got very far.  I started it again a year or so later wondering, "why was it again that I never got very far in this book?"  I figured that out rather quickly.  I doubt I'll pick up this book a third time 
 I was hugely disappointed with this book. While some of the new 3.5 rules features are nice, those familiar with its 2nd edition predecessor, the Monstrous Manual, will find the more aesthetic aspects of this book lacking.  Firstly, the quality of the illustrations in this book doesn't even come close to that of the 2e Monstrous Manual (the same could be said for most of WOTC's illustrations). Some creatures don't even get an illustration.  Secondly, the book is poorly laid-out. This has already been discussed, and WOTC rectified it in subsequent MM publications -- but they should seriously consider re-revising this book.  Thirdly, the editing is almost nonexistent. Barely a page goes by without some sort of typographical error (ie. cleric spelled 'clertic' or 'x monster is about is about y feet high'). Hell, the sub-editors didn't even notice that their entry in the credits is written as "Editorial Assitance". There is a proofreader named in the credits, but it's painfully obvious she didn't actually do any proofreading before the book went to print.  In conclusion, while the 2e Monstrous Manual might be obselete in terms of rules, it was a much better product. It had more monsters, better illustrations, a better layout, and better editing. It was better value for money than this rubbish. Sadly, though, if you want to run a game using the d&d 3.5 rules, you're going to need to get a copy of this book. See if you can get one second-hand, though, as it's really not worth the price new 
 I'm mad to have paid for this DVD! Mr. Pozo only teaches and demonstrates the man's part for most steps, which is frustrating since the woman's part is exactly the opposite. He goes through everything so quickly we kept having to stop and back it up. It doesn't teach you to dance, and it especially doesn't teach you in minutes. 
 I really was excited about this book from reading reviews and giving it a quick scan in the bookstore.  Unfortunately, a scan is all it is worth.  The first section of the book seems to alternate between the author's pride at being "the ATM" of the Irvine Company, (paying out cash for political favors), referring to himself as "the Wizard", and moaning about his relationship.  I don't deny the passion of Mr. Wisner's feelings, he seems to have been very committed to his relationship, but it takes an incredibly skilled writer to convey longing and heartbreak.  This comes across like an episode of "The Young and the Restless".    His travel accounts are somewhat engaging, but he still fails to connect with the reader.  I have also traveled around the world, and understand how relationships can be very complicated with cultural differences.  Mr. Wisner seems to take more pride in his prowess than writing an insightful scene.  I would really suggest choosing something else, this would have made a good blog, not a book.  
 This novel is absolute dreck, at the best. I don't think I could ever pick up another Grisham novel without vomiting. Pelican Brief was Okay. But, I honestly cannot read him again, because of this.    The reason for this one star rating is this.  First, the protaganist is a stupid punk kid, who by the end of the novel you are actually hoping gets shot or SOMETHING!  Second, 496 pages filled with "blah blah blah" There wasn't enough content to constitute a five hundred page novel. Maybe one hundred, and then it would have been decent.    Third, When reading about a murder mystery with the mob involved, you would at least expect more blood-shed, or more death. Especially since this is targeted at a group that enjoys those kinds of things.   Fourth, although written at a fourth grade level no fourth grader should be allowed within three hundred feet for all the swearing that takes place. Speech and the written word, are signs of intelligence, Vulgarity is something people use when they don't know how to convey something accurately. Honestly every page has at least some.   Now you know,that unless you want your socks bored off, you shouldn't even look in the section that has Grisham in it. If you want to read something light, that's believable, not Fantasy and not Romance, read Crichton. 
 The film shows no action, except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body, and you ask yourself, in what relation to the subject of the film this stands. (Sorry, forgot the 3-second-sceen of a naked young man) Just the head of 17-year-old lads, who wonder why they got infected, when they work as prostitute,  explaning in detail what they are to do in this job and where you can find them in Prag. (Like advertising) You are provided with not the least background information about their education, why they left their home town, why they have no normal job. I would wonder what politics think and do  about the youth in the new EC-country, what young people get told about the danger of deceases at school, and what other chances they have in life 
 It is an interesting tale and a common one I am sure.  There are portions that resonate with all gay men but the writing itself is at times, cliched and sloppy. None of that would matter, though, if I were not so offended by John Reid's (aka Andrew Tobias') rampant egomania.  Even within his constricting closet, he passes judgement on those he deems too gay, not macho enough, not as attractive as he is.  It's difficult to sympathize with his struggle.  He yearns for freedom and acceptance while blindly condemning the "less blessed" around him.  I find it repugnant and after reading about Mr. Tobias' "young stud pool parties" in New York Magazine a few years back, it seems that not much has changed.  He's older now but still fit and tan and, oh yeah, very rich.  God Bless America. The sequel is called "The Best Little Boy In The World Grows Up".  I have not read it but I am doubtful. For me, this book in some way celebrates the elitism that is so overwhelming in the gay community. That is what is truly hurtful and awful about the subculture and what it's teaching young gay men 
 Generally I wouldn't review a book I didn't finish.  I only got about halfway through this snoozer.  Still I tasted the food and it was bland.  Please skip this stinker.  There are no new ideas or theories in this book, not to mention the theories espoused are wrong.  Lack of food is not caused by the Catholic church and "family planning" - it's caused by political systems and lack of freedom.  Period.  And although I totally support helping the malnourished, I do not support making room in our own budget to support other countries.  We already give enough welfare to many countries who don't need it or who just hoard it for themselves and freeze out the truly needy.  The author basically lectures and gives the reader what he feels is the truth, and avoids presenting the facts and letter someone make their own mind up.  My favorite quote is from page 29 (of my text).  "Virtually all populations contain very many different genetic types (for reasons that need not concern us), and some are always outreproducing others."   Pass this book on 
 This is a sad effort and sadder still that these ideas were published. The fact that any publisher believes that readers of social history would be interested in such a twisted analysis of the nature of man/woman and the development of societies is indeed sad. McElvaine is a longtime self promoting boor stuck in a jerkwater academic environment with way too much time for idle pondering. His imagination worked overdrive to produce this piece of fantasy. I guess if any of us had enough time on our hands we too could construct elaborate theories on the 'nature of things' and put enough of a self-loathing feminist slant on it to attract a fringe readership. That's what happened here. Don't waste your time. A disturbing aspect to this is that he's teaching the next generation of leaders 
 Whoever produced this software seems to have missed the point. There is no point in havng one VPN client on your machine that limits you to just being able to use that one client. It would be similar to, say, allowing people to just access one web site on the Internet. In my case I already had two VPN clients related to work when I installed a Netgear router with VPN capabilities on my home network. The VPN software from Netgear stops my other VPN clients working.   Added to my woes I can't tell you how often I saw 'the blue screen of death' during my repeated software install/de-install efforts.  I am now returning both the router and the client software as this is an unusable solution 
 A friend lent me Good In Bed when I'd run out of ideas for books to read. I read it, didn't care much for the characters, and ultimately came out of the story feeling worse about life.   A few months later, I came upon this book, and since Weiner's actual writing style wasn't so bad, I thought I'd check it out. I didn't even finish it.   It seems as if Jennifer Weiner writes to make herself feel better when she's down; exalting overweight, plain-faced girls who have a tendency to whine, writing the petite and attractive with overtones of condescencion and contempt, and failing completely to create a male character with more than one and a half dimensions.   That said, this could have been a good story. Weiner does have some talent as a writer... her prose flows easily and is unpretentious, she speaks realistically even when the characters are hardly likeable, and the general ideas of the plot following the sisters' relationship, the connection with their grandmother, and what they do after their falling-out were all fun and interesting. I did very nearly almost care about these characters.   Still, I couldn't actually bring myself to give a hoot about these whiny, one-dimensional people. It's books like this that make me hate chick-lit so much. If you want to read girly stories, I'd rather you go to Barbara Kingsolver or Amy Tan... at least they have brains to back up their talent 
 Stupid me didn't realize this and ordered it.  Just wanted to make sure anyone out there who's as stupid as myself wouldn't make the same mistak 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 OK... this book has action. However, it seemed to me that the action sequences were not written for the readers but rather to satisfy Author's need to be tedious and verbose.   Here is a question I want to throw at the people who read this book and gave it more than 2 stars.   "How did the military test Supernova to see whether it works or not in the first place before it was stolen?"   I sure as hell would love to know the answer to this question from the readers who are hyping this book and also the author himself.   This book is trash. Dump it and move on to the next one on your list 
 Why are you paying such good money for a no-calorie water?! How many calories does water have to begin with?! It would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial(?a cheeseburger?). Please do NOT buy this. Fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to.... NO CALORIES! Give the money that you would have spend to charity. The makers of this water are thieves and con artists 
 Madacy has done it again...taken what could have been decent DVD's and turned them into trash. The video transfer from film is very poor, but the worst is the audio. Madacy has a history of producing low-cost low-quality  legacy DVD's, just look at other reviews of Madacy titles (check out  Charlie Chaplin DVD's). This is a shame because younger folks who've never  seen these classics may walk away with the wrong impression 
 I usually cook everything from scratch and don't mind spending a few hours making several appetizers. BUT, to make just one  recipe in this book, you'd need to spend a couple of hours. The majority of the recipes are too fussy and complicated and just not worth the trouble. I made a couple of the crepe appetizers with different fillings. They were the least time-consuming but the result still wasn't worth the effort - no one took seconds 
 You know the music industry is in decline when people are giving this single a perfect rating.  Run for cover 
 I received an email on March 18, 2006, asking me to write a review.  I've waited this long because I kept thinking I would receive it any day - It's June 1st and I still have not received this book!!  I've called about it, and was told they would look into it (that was 1st part of May) - still nothing.  Can someone tell me what's going on please!!  Thank you (I think) 
 This isn't really a history book.  It is just a collection of pictures with captions under them 
 I found the book disappointing in that it depends on the interpretation of experience being a legitimate means of proving the existence of a deity.  I don't need this book for that.  Also the christological bent of this author is offputting, giving the sense that he's not able to step back far enough to sense whether his views are in truth as objective as he pretends them to be, or as I sense them to be, subjective wishful thinking 
 This is a pitifully obvious attempt to CASH in on the manga craze. The Comics Journal never covered manga until recently and mostly just scoffed at it. Now they have a huge book supposedly devoted to it. Yet the COMICS SECTION features a bunch of indy cartoonists and  TCJ regulars who don't draw manga at all!!   With the exception of Tezuka the artists covered here are not terribly noteworthy in the scene as a whole and just further the feeling that they just slapped this book together to drain some wallets and ride the trend.   This is just another crass attempt to cash in by a snobby magazine that has traded its elitism in for pure greed 
 For anyone, who is thinking of buyin this CD, don't! You'll be sorry just like I am.  I went into the CD store today and saw the CD.  I asked the clerk if he heard it and he said it had some tight beats and wall all  around tight. I even was being a little facecious with him and told him I  would bring the CD back if he was lyin. Well he lied.  This is the worst  garbabe I've heard Bleed put out.  He is no longer on No Limit which put  out his first and tight CD My balls and my word.  The two CDs don't even  compare.  I will boycott Bleed forever!   I can't believe he fell off this  bad 
 I expected fast and flavorful recipes that might fit into a low processed carbs, high protein diet.  For one reason or another, none of these recipes appeal to me.  Each one had a different reason I wouldn't make it:  more meat per serving than I like, large amounts of cheese, too many calories or too much saturated fat.  (I've never said I wasn't picky.)  If the Atkin's diet works for you this book might be just the ticket.  I might try another Rachael Ray cookbook but I would read it before buying.  
 This is one of my all-time favorite movies, but I was very disappointed with the DVD version.  In the middle of the movie, you will have to get up, go to your DVD player, and flip the DVD over to the second side to see the rest of the movie.  I don't know what bozo came up with that idea, but it defeats the purpose of relaxing and enjoying a good movie.  Who wants to get up and flip the DVD over in the middle of the suspense?  This format takes stupidity to the next level.  I would highly recommend the VHS since I have it and it's wonderful.  I would NOT recommend the DVD until they do a better version.  The packaging is in paper and not durable at all, another truly bad idea.  DVD's should be in plastic cases, not paper 
 This book is summarized in a single sentence "be a good teacher".  All the supporting comments should only take up a paragraph - not a  book.  And even then, every thing in the book is self evident and not really needed to be written down. The only people that should be interested in this are those in administration - for some obscure reason they seem to like rhetoric - then again - they are also usually diametrically opposed to the best interests of students and teachers 
 We were  really looking forward to having some Omaha Steaks again. Unfortunately, every steak had grissle and was very tuff. The flavor was not what we remebered either, they were very bland. I could have gotten a better steak at the supermarket and saved myself alot of money 
 If you like your history to read like a high school term paper, this might be for you. Incoherent and grammatically bizarre sentences within an unfocused and rambling framework made this impossible for me to get through 
 I recently read "I", "K", and "L" in succession.  Compared to "Innocent" and "Killer", I found Lawless to be slow paced (even though this edition finds Kinsey spontaneously traveling across the country) and the plot twists less surprising.  With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line.  I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome.  Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...).  I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in "L" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.  Anyway, there are others in this series I would recommend more highly ("M" being one of them) 
 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 John Hagee is just another tin-horn preacher who has found a profitable niche in peddling his view of the end-times psychodrama. These books contain the usual text out of context Bible quotes and literal interpretations that are unique to Hagee, Hal Lindsey and other end-times hucksters. Hagee serves up the usual hate diatribes against Muslims in this book as well as his idolatry of Israel and its unique role in the end of the world. Hate is an important part of this book and his brand of "Christianity."  He basically will keep writing the same book over and over as long as their are people willing to be duped by his "prophecy". For all the poor people who waste their time and money on this garbage, I am reminded of what Billy Graham said regarding the endtimes: "the world ends when you die. 
 This is the eleventh or twelvth Pratchett book I've read, and it is by far the worst.  That's somewhat misleading, though, because it's the only bad Pratchett book I've read at all.    I'm not australian, but I did catch on to many of the australian references.  The problem was that most of them weren't funny.  Pratchett's humor has always lain with the insight and subtlety with which he makes his cultural references and satire tie into the situation at hand.  However, in The Last Continent, there is no "situation at hand".  The story rambles on and on, seemingly without point.  People and things come and go without notice or reason, often simply to fit the motif of australian references.  The story of the wizards and the story of Rincewind don't converge until the very last pages of the book, and the convergence is not even explained (how rincewind knows to find the cave and then to draw in it).  The reason for Rincewind's problem is not explained at any stage (why the librarian changes shape, why the wizards' presence in the past is causing the present to shift at random, why it doesn't rain, etc).  The humor that does exist in the book is shallow in nearly every case.  Often it's just inane bickering between the wizards, which elicits cheap laughs, but doesn't grab one's attention.  The humor isn't structured at all, which is Pratchett's normal approach.  In his other books, the humor develops around some reference.  Here they are mostly just one liners.  In The Last Continent, the only time this kind of humor develops is on the topic the wizards' sexual repression, which is entirely unrelated to the story's problem.  I strongly recommend other Pratchett books such as Jingo, Small Gods, or Reaper Man for a much more sophisticated example of fantasy satire 
 Work outside the home or stay at home mom? --there is no one right way -- It is sad that people can be so close minded to only see their side as the "right" side.  There are many types of people and situations --there can't be one right way --and not everyone has choices.  Stay at home mothers may want a voice --but believe me, most working mothers want a voice --many act as though we work for our own benefit --yes, we may benefit in some ways --but many went to work specifically to benefit our families --things such as medical benefits, a decent neighborhood, etc. In the end, some may have been fortunate enough to offer other advantages such as educational opportunities or memorable family vacations after providing the basics --- Or perhaps, the opportunity for them to know their father who is able to work near regular hours since there is another income.  For some, having the father work extensive hours and have minimal time with the kids so that the mother is home works well to meet their goals.  For other families, it does not.  For mine, we originally had no choice --a bit over 16 years ago, I went to work leaving our one year old thinking I was doing a horrible thing.  I did it because there was no other way --my husband was a Architectural Draftsman making $15k per year (no med benefits).  Because we believed me being home was the right thing, we did everything we could to be able to have me at home.  He bartended on the weekend and took his office's after work janitor job when the janitor quit --I did accounting work at home and tried coordinating waitressing eves.  In the end, I had to go to work full time, we could not make it and we needed benefits.  The world was very unsupportive of me and made me feel like a bad mother for doing this --I did not want to leave my daughter, I did not want to go to work, my husband listened to me cry at lunch each day --I did it for my family.  --That one year old is now 17.  I also have a 12 year old.  I ended up continuing to work as by the time I may have had somewhat of a limited "choice", my kids were in school and my views had changed.  My working has brought benefits to my kids, my home and my marraige.  I have a very happy marriage of 20 years.  My husband is an active parent.  Have I missed previous moments because I worked?  Yes --and that does make me sad --but I also know I have had other moments that are valuable--and my kids have had significant moments because I work --with me and others.  No matter what, I am a happy person which I feel might be the most important ingredient to a good mother.  But that is me --what works for me and my family certainly may not be the best answer for all because we are all different.  I was fortunate to find a way of life that has worked for us. -- My kids?  Very happy, well adjusted kids who I am very proud of.  A couple days ago my daughter, senior in high school was discussing this issue and said I will definitely work --I was surprised and asked her why --she said that when she sees all her friends with stay at home mothers, the mothers seem very unhappy and do less for their kids than I do --(referring to college visit/app process, driving places, spending one on one time, working together, etc.)  My response was that you have to wait and see --you don't know what choices you may have --and being able to stay at home, if only for awhile can be a very wonderful opportunity --and -certainly -not all stay at home mothers are unhappy.    There is no right answer and it is a very small and close minded person who can't understand that.  As women, as mothers, I hope some day we can support each other rather than knock each other down to make ourselves feel superior.  
 I was really shocked and disappointed to find this DVD had been cut... this was one of the best films I saw in the 70's.  I also discovered that another great movie, "Goodbye Columbus," has been edited down to a PG since its release on DVD with the original nude scenes deleted.  I'm encouraging people NOT to buy or rent these DVD's and to write the studios and complain... it's bad enough that Columbia and Paramount have ruined their own product, but they didn't even have the courtesy to notify buyers that they weren't purchasing the original films.  I agree with another reviewer here... we're being robbed 
 I have a few pieces of the Wilton Armetale Reggae line, which I purchased from a department store and which I enjoy.  So I purchased two of these petite trays from Amazon, and they arrived looking like defective products, both of them.  I expected the petite trays to have a smooth, bright shiny surface (like my others).  Rather, both trays are dull gray and the surface is the texture of an orange peel!  In addition, the carved design around the edges should be filled with black ink (or whatever that is), but portions of the carvings are not even colored.  In short, I was shocked and disappointed in the quality of this product.  I wonder if Amazon is selling defective goods that didn't pass the muster for a department store.     
 This book has a major deficiency as a reference: you can't easily find a specific topic. The book has no index and the table of contents is too high-level to help you find a particular topic (for example, "vi Commands" as a table of contents entry isn't really going to help you locate a particular command).  The level of detail that is presented varies widely throughout the book. For example, Chapter 4 gives multi-sentence descriptions of the substitute command and regular expressions. Chapter 1 lists each command line option with a brief one-sentence description. Chapter 7 lists the vi options with no descriptions (the name of the option is often not self-explanatory--what does "magic" or "beautify" do?). If something is worth listing in this book, at least give it a brief description.  A quibble is with the four chapters on vi clones. It would have been nice if the author briefly described each of the clones and pointed out their strengths and weaknesses. These four chapters occupy over half of the book, so adding an extra overview paragraph to each chapter would not have significantly added to the bulk of the book.  On the positive side, I found the lists of command line options and vi commands useful.  Instead of buying this book, I would recommend searching for the various vi quick reference guides available on the Web for free. Some might argue that I'm expecting too much from a "pocket reference" and that it is intended for experienced users. My view is that the book could have been so much more useful. As it is, I do not feel the cost of the book is justified by its content 
 This film is beautifully acted by Kevin Spacey, but far too dark and gloomy for comfortable viewing.  It may indeed depict what the writer thought of the film world, but why inflict this depiction on the world I ask.  The story is cynical, cruel and I found the last half of the film very uncomfortable to watch.  Not a favourite 
 Him? Who?  Who's he? Him!  I don't know who he is.  It's him. Who's he!!!  HIM!!!  Alright, ENOUGH!  He is JOHN COUGAR MELLENCAMP!! He is HIM!! 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 I liked this tub at first.  The size was nice, and the sling was comfortable and good support for my preemie newborn.  After about a month of use, though, there was a horrible odor emitting from the mesh sling.  This was after "squeezing" it out as best I could and propping it up to dry after every use.  The sling is not machine washable and therefore unusable after it gets ruined by mold.  I stopped using the sprayer after the first couple days.  It was just too much of a pain to fill it up everytime, especially since it doesn't even spray well.  The other reviewers are correct in saying that the button on the sprayer is difficult to press.  Especially when your hands are wet and slippery. It's a good thing BRU will take back anything!  I am off to return it and purchase the old faithful cheapie tub 
 I was quite disappointed with this one.  First of all the book's ending is very grim.  I agree with another reviewer when they said they'd rather be left imagining what kind of messes Arthur and Ford were getting themselves into now.  And so many unanswered questions!  What happened to Fenchurch and why didn't Arthur care more about what happened to her?  What happened to Zaphod?  Colin the robot?  What is the question to the answer 42?  What was Fenchurch's idea that would solve the world's problems?  What was the point to the people on Rupert?  It's worth reading just to be able to finish off the series and because it's still well written and funny just like the others.  But be prepared to be disappointed by the loose ends and finale.  
 We bought this scratch remover years ago from an auto store. It wasn't that expensive but totally useless. We put it on a scratch or two on our car which is black and did what it said. It did nothing except leave a white stain on the area I applied it to. I tried everything to get it off, then I had to use my last option rubbing compound.   Luckily the rubbing compound got the stain off. After this I dumped the tube in our basement and lost track of it since then (Probably dumped it). Shortly after we went to the auto store again and we found auto paint. They come in a little tube with a paint brush and each paint has a code (got to get the one for your model car). Used it worked well and years later still looks good.   Up close you can still see a scratch was there but only really up close. After that I waxed the area after the paint dried and it looked fine. Unless you look for it you will not see a scratch. So don't buy this product either buy the auto paint or take your car to an auto body shop. This product would be better as a door stop and even then it would probably do a poor job. 
 Looks slick, decent sound and great price BUT  flimsy attenna and CD player broke after 1 week (on its own - I didn't even open it up after loading in the first group of CDs).  Took it to JVC repair and they couldn't fix it or find out was wrong.  Ruined my impression of JVC.  Remember the wisdom "you get what you pay for". . .  
 First, despite what the socialist apologists tell you, Walter Rodney almost certainly was killed by a bomb he was holding in his lap while plotting to bust some co-conspirators out of prison.  Only afterwards did his fellow socialist party members concoct a story about exploding walkie-talkies.  Come on.  It exploded in his lap for goodness sake.  Mark Hoffman tried that defense and it didn't get him anywhere either.  Second, championing the cause of the poor, which Rodney admittedly did, is not the same as actually helping them, or even more important for HEUA, being a perceptive scholar.  Rodney's book is riddled with distortions, fallacies and unsubstantiated premises.  One glaring example.  Rodney pays practically zero attention to Mediterranean Africa.  For him, only sub-Saharan Africa is the "real" Africa.  Why?  Because his natural ethnic affinity for the area.  Nothing wrong with that, but then again, you shouldn't title your book "How Europe Underdeveloped Africa" but rather "How Europe Underdeveloped Sub-Saharan Africa." Rodney has engaged in thinly veiled racial rage and socialist dogma to rail against a bogeyman, a straw man, or almost anything other than the truth: Africa's problems arise from its residents, not from outside forces.  And spouting Marxist dogma isn't going to change that fact.  It was known 25 years ago; it's known a fortiori now 
 This comic book is a replay of an ancient war in Greece. The director of Sin City intends to make a movie out of the books contents. Interesting read but it is over in 15-20 minutes and for the price I would take a second thought 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 It simply scares me to think that some who read this book will believe that what it says is true. While this theory of economic imperialism isn't technically impossible, it's the kind of idea better left to an ideological blog somewhere instead of a book purporting to be a true account. Books like this make the left look as naive and stupid as Ann Coulter books make the right look bigoted and, well, stupid. This is an incredibly implausible account, and books like this, claiming to be nonfiction, undermine good writing and reporting everywhere. Shame on the author and the publisher. The only redeeming quality of this book was that it contained a list of other books published by Berrett-Koehler, the contents of which make it obvious that BK is simly a peddler of 4th rate crackpot theories, all of which appear to be of the nonfiction variety. 
 I bought this book because my son started talking about outer space and rockets, etc... I also bought it because we have several other Byron Barton books and my son really enjoys reading and looking at. However, this book is a little boring, doesn't keep his interest and isn't on the same level as the other Barton books 
 In her work, Amy Hollywood explores the writings of Margueritte Porete, Mechtild of Magdeburg, and Meister Johannes Eckhart, all medieval mystical writers of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.  Further, she attempts to wrestle with a previous work by Herbert Grundmann that the teachings of German mystics were formed by the intellectual underpinnings of the mystical and religious experience of medieval women.  It is then Hollywood's hope to demonstrate the influences of the beguine mysticism, as exemplified through Porete and Mechtild, on Eckart's work.  In addition, Hollywood explores how these three mystics, "... subvert medieval discourses on, and practices concerned with, gender and subjectivity."    Accordingly, Hollywood brings together Porete, Mechtild, and Eckhart to illustrate several strains found in all of their writings.  First, both bodily and spiritual suffering are implicitly and explicitly criticized by Mechtild, Porete, and Eckhart.  Scholars, in the past, have tried to define the language of female mystics, and these two are no exception, in terms of erotic and bodily imagery, which historians maintain is the cultural predilection of women towards such imagery.   However, Hollywood believes that all of these writers have an apophatic nature to them.  It is more explicit in Eckhart, but Hollywood maintains that all three use apophatic means to try to describe God.   None of these mystics can properly describe God because of His unknowable nature, so they use terms that were familiar to their intended audience.  These mystics also emphasized the suppression of the will to become one with God.  Eckhart stressed the importance of surrender of the self [the soul], "for the divine being is equal to nothing, and in it there is neither image nor form."   While the women, Mechthild and Porete, describe divine experiences, thus emphasizing personal authority due to God's intervention, Eckhart conveys "priestly authority" available to men during the period, however, his emphasis upon personal detachment allows the concept of the soul's union with God to be available to all.   Thus, to Hollywood, women were forced to seek access to the divine and to public voices by inscribing their souls with suffering and with wounds marking the presence of God and the limits of description.  Taken together, the three mystics and their attitude towards the body are similar in that they all stressed the importance of minimizing the body to concentrate on the soul.  Medieval society emphasizes asceticism as the path to God, but again, the three mystics emphasize what the soul must do to forge a path to God.   Of course, Hollywood does make several assumptions to make her thesis work.  First, that the two female mystics attempted to explain God in unknowable terms, and that they used terms that their society could understand, and the second, that Eckhart did read these two female mystic writers 
 This book is a terrible representation of the Navajo Indians.  None of the information that is in this book is a valid representation of  their traditions. The information that we are teaching to our children from this book is false and very stereotypical.   It should be taken out of every school 
 Vasari's classic text is well written (translated, I guess I should say) but extremely tiresome.  For nearly every artist he simply lists their works, and rarely with more analysis than by describing them as "life-like" or "beautiful."  For example, here is what he says about Titian's Assumption of the Virgin in Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice, one of his most famous and celebrated paintings: "He did a panel for the main altar containing Our Lady ascending into heaven, with the twelve apostles standing below her and watching her ascent, but since this work was painted on canvas and perhaps poorly cared for, little of it can be seen."  That's it.  The only exception to his utter factual tediousness is Michelangelo's Life, where, although he goes into almost no description of the works themselves besides his characteristic fulsomeness, he does provide some interesting anecdotes.  If you are looking to understand and analyze Renaissance art than this book will not help you.  If you are looking to engage in scholarly debate over the origins and documentations of the discussed works then you should probably read the original, unedited version in Italian anyway. 
 If you  are getting married, do yourself a favor.. ignore all information in this book unless you want a couple of wed-in-Vegas journalists to plan your most sacred day. I second the notion--this book is no BARGAIN. 
 Dr. Laura occasionally gives excellent advice, and I admire her willingness to stand up for what's decent and moral.  However, her supposition that husbands do not need a book or advice is almost blasphemous.  God created men and women and the institution of marriage, and even He gives instructions to husbands as to how they should treat their wives!  God "wrote a book" called the Bible which contains advice for husbands as well as wives because God knows the success of a marriage depends on BOTH parties doing their part.    This book is great for women who are unkind to their husbands.  When unkind people change and become kind and considerate to all those with whom they have a relationship, it CAN have an impact on the behavior of others.  But this applies not only to women and wives but to men and husbands as well.  Many women are suffering because, after reading all the books they can and doing everything within their power, their husbands do not respond.  So the self-doubting and blame continues, and it's needless.  The attitude that a successfull and happy marriage rests solely with the wife is detrimental to EVERY marriage 
 If the author had spent more time telling us about Detroit and less time telling us how literate he is then it would have been a lot better book 
 This guy Armond White writes in the kind of pseudointellectual, exaggerated style that is really laughable. Rather than just focusing on the inherent drama and sadness of 'Pac's life, he has to throw in references to Morrissey and all kinds of other non-sequitors just to show how "deep" he is.  Instead of reading this lousy bio, listen to "Hail Mary" or any other classic Tupac track and you'll get much more out of it 
 Bad reviews typically receive bad reviews. So be it. After several chapters of trying to decide whether the problem was me or the author, I simply gave up. This is no easy read. I don't think we gain much from an endless list of data. 
 I know that I will outrage alot of people with this review but here goes... This is one of only 2 books that I have ever read that I truly REGRET devoting the time to , but once I start a book I always finish.I don't know what else to say except that it was painful for me to finish this.  I just don't get it.  The main character was quite annoying to me and the story was SO SLOW and predictable I really just wanted it to end. I would not recommend this book for fun and if it is required reading for you I am sorry.   
 I was looking forward to this, but it is unreadable. You will cringe at what feels like a smug and pompous college student's first essay 
 Well, nice cinematography as set-designer work: nicely interiors and well dressed actors. Maybe, visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once, but not enough to consider it as a remarkable  movie of year, as other reviewers trying to assure 
 Well, this is a book for and from the previous millennium ; talks about A:/fdisk  ; disks smaller then 512 Mbyte. Pages all about IDE-hard disk,  their connectors with photographs and all; in short  : out of time.  
 Ann Rule wrote the story of a young couple on a camping trip from Hell! The hero is murdered and the murderer is sexually obsessed with his sexy young wife, Joanne Lindstrom. He captures her, strips and rapes her several times over, and the poor victim is helpless in the woods and grows dependent on the evil "Red Man" She even falls in love with him, and he succeeds in planting his seed in her belly. This sounds like some wild male rape fantasy, but Ms. Rule wrote it, not I. Strange crime story, with highly explicit rape scenes. Highly recommended 
 If it were possible to give this movie zero stars, i would have. Although it may have won an Academy Award and been considered great in it's day, it is now outdated and boring. Unless scenes of teenagers trying to have sex with anyone are interesting to you, then maybe you will find it interesting. When i say anyone, i do mean anyone. The main chracter, Sonny, who is a teenager sleeps with Ruth, wife of his footbal coach and the young girl, Jacy, sleeps with her mother's lover on a pool table. The film also attempts to bring up homosexuality but keeps it muted. You would think a movie called "The Last Picture Show" would be more about a picture show but it really has very little to do with the movie. There is some nudity which was huge for the time of it's release since it was practically unheard of. The film is also completely in black and white which was a choice of the director so the film could give a better feel of the time period, 1950's. This movie also gives a bad impression of those who live in the country, making them look like they are so bored of their desolate surroundings that they must seek sex with anyone who is willing. If this movie would have been made in present day, it would be your typical porn movie but since none of the sex scenes are actually shown they just show the faces and i guess that is what it allows it to be called an "award winning movie" and not a porn. Also if you think the movie was bad, try reading the book it was based off of, much worse 
 This book is a textbook and it feels like one from beginning to end.  "Pedantic" is a gross understatement. The exercises are useful but I think a budding writer might find this program more harmful than helpful, in it's desire to make sure you're always following his rules.  In the end his approach might get you some ideas.. but not before it sucks all the fun out of the creative process.    If, on the other hand, you are a type A personality who really wants a rigid set of rules so you can feel secure in tackling something creative, maybe this will work for you.  But my impression is that the aim of the book is to make storytelling so complicated and boring that he wants you to give up writing by the time you finish reading it.  I'm a writer who buys all these books as way of refreshing my process and finding new inspiration.  "Inspiring" this book is not 
 This is nothing more than a re-release of many of the same badly remade TV themes from the mid-eighties albums entitled "Tee Vee Toons Presents..." series by TVT Records.  Many of these songs are replicated (horribly) with outdated keyboards and synthisizers.  I find it sad that TV Guide would slap it's name on such a horrible compilation album such as this.  For some unknown reason, companies that put together TV theme compilations think lovers of TV music won't care that they've included cheap remakes of there favorite theme songs!  If you can't get the original version, than don't put it on the album!   Another pet peeve, is that often times (like in here) they put the lesser popular version of the theme in as well. Example: They have the first season version of the Mary Tyler Moore theme "Love Is All Around".  The arrangement and lyrics were different in this version than in the entire rest of the series.  It's not the popular version.    People who put these together are not usually fans of TV themes and usually don't know what they are doing.  Oh yeah, don't mix the long record version (usually not enough like the original to be recognizable) with the shorter TV versions!  I've said my peace!  Larry Lee Moniz Hayward, California  
 We can only see what we are is a theory of quantum physics. Therefore when James Patterson makes his serial killer a vegetarian and his detective a ribs eater, he is projecting his own guilt at being the serial killer of animals, at being the payer of the hitmen at the slaughterhouse.  In actuality, violence is correlated so strongly to the murder at the slaughterhouse and the consumption of cadavers that in the 19th Century, butchers were not allowed to sit on British juries. 
 Waste of money.  Waste of time.  Well-known cast.  Amateurish direction.  Plotless.  Politically correct to the point of being stupid.  The film's incessant attempts at humor fail.  Eric Roberts' character laughs-off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film.  He is self-important, Godless and emotionally false.  It's difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character.  The best performances in this film were given by Gregory Harrison and Lee Grant.  The best scene is Gregory Harrison and Eric Roberts' passionate farewell kiss.  Most authentic moment in the film: Lee Grant's reaction to her dying son being carried off.  Very difficult to watch through in one-sitting because it's so repetitive and vapid. You will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments.  If you choose to waste your time with this film, you'll be sorry you did 
 "A Music Fan" says he only knew one of these songs?!! What cave has he been living in?? His gross lack of music knowlege is scary! You can do better than this compilation - Too few songs and chosen rather arbitrarily. The songs are classics though. Still can't believe previous reviewer didn't know "Sounds of Silence", "Pretty Woman", etc. --- How sad 
 This has got to be the lamest book I've ever gotten sucked intobuying merely because of its catchy title.  I was hoping the authorswould have done some real research on this subject.  After all, how hard could it be?  Everyone knows that many politicians say incredibly stupid things all the time.  One could probably fill a book this size with material from Quayle, Helms and Thurmond alone.  Ok, so they did find some of the well known inanities produced by those three.  But then they just go and copy things almost at random out of the daily papers, including much that is obvious intentional humor, or sometimes quite clever irony, or simply mildly scrambled syntax, then hang some lame introductory titles on each quotation, and try to tell us that these are hilarious examples of political stupidity.  And much of what they quote is from various anonymous government grunts, and not from public figures at all.  The authors should be ashamed, even if its all the way to the bank. Like H.L Mencken (I believe) said more than half a century ago, you'll never go broke underestimating the intelligence of the American public...  If this is what the noble art of political satire has come to in this dumbed down decade, we are indeed in trouble.  (Incidentally, I gave this book one star only because Amazon provides no way to give it zero. 
 I read through this book in a few hours. I was thinking it was an "okay" book untill I got to the supplement section. I felt like it was a commercial. The author kept mentioning his favorite brands, which was usually one brand in particular. I wasn't surprised to see a magazine-style add in the back of the book for that brand. I have a hard time considering the recommendations credible when they are advertizing a body-building product. I also bought "Scrawny to Brawny" It took me over a week to read and the info is waayyyy better in my opinion!  There was a good section that explained how to properly to the exercises which is the best part of the boo 
 If you want to read a great book on personal illness by a fine writer, read Reynolds Price' "A Whole New Life."  The prose is authentic and there is not a touch of pretense in it.   Styron's lack of insight into his illness is topped only by his lack of knowledge of abnormal psychology.  His declaration that depression is caused by a chemical imbalance is disturbing, because it mixes cause and effect.  His assertion is tantamount to attributing global warming to melting glaciers.  Mixing cause and effect is not something one would attribte to a writer of his distinction, as it is the essence of clear thought.  Yes, the intensity and distribution of various neuro-chemicals have been found to be compromised among those suffering depression who have been tested.  But how are they compromised?  Contrary to the author's belief that "the madness results from an aberrant biochemical process," and that "such madness is chemically induced," it is the commonly-held view today that psychology plays the decisive causitive role in mental illness, as that psychology is formulated and developed throughout life, and is influenced by situations, including loss, misuse of drugs and alcochol, and unconscious dilemmas, among others.   That an organic etiology has been surmised in many cases of schizophrenia and other psychosis, as well as in profound obsessions, certainly "rules in" brain damage, whether it is evident at birth, or the result of other physical and emotional trauma later in life; but it does not rule out psychology and the higher order mental functions we attribute to consciousness.       
 After loving her on Getz/Gilberto#1, I bought this album and was disappointed b/c it has a much more loungy and symphonic feel--too done for my taste.  You'll hear strings and a many more instruments than Getz/Gilberto#1.  Her voice is pretty and mellow as always.  Maybe it will grow on me, but right now, I'm pretty disappointed 
 Despite trying very hard to deny that this is just another fad management book - there is nothing new in this title.  Clueless managers will recite the core principals of this book and treat them as gospel as they try to improve their bottom line.  It is also worth noting that at least one of the "great" organizations in the book, Fannie May, has imploded in an accounting scandal.  Not the worst fad management book ever written, but that isn't saying much 
 I was convinced to sample the Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever upon reading the reviews on Amazon.  Many debated the merit of the trilogy due to the tragic and conflicted soul of the protagonist, Covenant himself.  He was described as an anti-hero.  Having read books one and two of these Chronicles, it was not Covenant who alienated me, but instead the writing of Stephen Donaldson.  I enjoyed the first book in a qualified way.  It was not a quick and exciting read, but I felt it had its merit.  One could feel for the plight of Thomas Covenant (being a leper and learning to survive as a leper only to be thrust into a world where his leprosy appeared healed - sure it would be great if it were true but it is quite natural someone in his position would be reluctant to accept it).  The world was complex but well-developed.  The flaws (as I judge them) that I will point out shortly about The Illearth War (Book 2) were present in Lord Foul's Bane (Book 1) but they were more forgivable for some reason.  Anyway, there was merit enough in the first book to make me plod through the second.  I mention that it is Stephen Donaldson's writing that drives me away.  It does so in several ways.  First, his is a very dense writing style.  He uses words that the common person does not.  I am not suggesting he is putting on airs or trying to be high-minded, I assume he is just that way.  I believe the words flow naturally from him.  It must be a weird experience to have a conversation with the man!  Allow me to share a very simple example from The Illearth War: "Their nostrils distended at the vapory breath of dawn or dusk.  Their eyes roamed searchingly over the sunward crags, the valleys occasionally bedizened with azure tarns, the hoary glaciers crouching in the highest cols, the snow-fed streams... Their wide foreheads and flat cheeks and confident poise betrayed no heart upsurge, no visceral excitement.  Yet there was something clear and passionate in their alacrity..." (page 421).  You could find innumerable examples of such lofty prose throughout.  I am sure it is just the way he writes.  I just do not find it enjoyable.  It is so dense and dry.  There is no poetry to it even when the passages are descriptive.  It is like a highly technical and labored experience.  The words are so precise the life is sucked from the narrative.  Again, at least that is my humble opinion.  I do not mind slow or difficult reads when there is a payoff.  This one maximized the difficulty but minimized the payoff.  Second, he has created a world with its own terms.  I suppose this is realistic in its way (although everyone speaks English most of the time anyway).  He gives us a brief glossary, but I would prefer my reads to do without one.  I have no idea what he is talking about when he uses the fictitious expressions.  It may make an exciting adventure for some readers but it just turned me off.  Who wants to work that hard to learn about a place that doesn't exist?  At least the fantasy words could have had some common root with our language.  Then things could have been somewhat intuitive.  Instead it was just gibberish to me.  And it played such a vital part throughout his works.  To not appreciate this literary device makes his work hard to enjoy.  Third, he builds ever so slowly to a climax.  Then the climax occurs and is gone and you feel like you must have missed something.  "Oh, so that's it," I was left thinking.  It was a long journey (a painful one at times, certainly a slow one), and then the payoff is not very rewarding.  Fourth, the bad guys seem awfully powerful.  I couldn't help wondering why they just didn't sweep all the good guys away.  They seem as though there is nothing that can stop them.  But then the good "lords" display similar power.  The magical powers just seem too present and too readily available for us common folk to relate to the struggle.  I couldn't find a reality to the war that was raging.  I didn't understand most of the magical beings.  They were not developed very fully.  I certainly credit Donaldson for his imagination.  He brings depth to the characters.  He seems to have created a world with a great degree of internal consistency.  I commend him for his talent, but if you are like me you won't much appreciate it.  These books remind me of Gene Wolfe and his works that compose The Book of the New Sun.  That work was more science fiction, but the protagonist also had darker issues to be dealt with.  Both worlds were difficult for me to identify with.  Both used expressions that made no sense to me.  They were both slow and deep reads.  If you like this Covenant series, I whole-heartedly recommend Wolfe's series to you (and vice versa).  My life would be no worse off had I missed both experiences.  I am going to skip The Power that Preserves (book 3) and just hope it all works out. 
 Waiting is a single-concept book novella confronting the difficulties of love and individual happiness in a restrictive society that is stretched to a few hundred pages. Ha Jin's personal accomplishments notwithstanding, this is one of the most overrated books I have read. National Book Award? Hmmm.   Waiting is the story of a doctor and loyal officer of the revolution, Lin, trapped in a loveless marriage. When Lin becomes passively entangled in an extramarital affair with a nurse at his hospital--Manna Wu--herself the victim of waiting for a man, he is repeatedly denied the divorce that his girlfriend demands. Everyone in Waiting waits...and waits...and waits.  The book gets its point across, and more or less works as an allegory on the Chinese communist state. It lacks any deeply interesting characterization, as Manna, and even Lin, are both all too childlike (as the author intends). The book also lacks lyricism and elegance, and unforgivable trangression for sucha  decorated piece of literature. Ha Jin's story educates, but doesn't elevate us 
 While I enjoy geology, it is not my profession. I am interested in expanding my knowledge but have no intention of becoming a geologist. I found this book so boring that I was unable to finish it. It reads very much like a textbook. It certianly contains a great deal of information, but it is related in such a dull fashion that it simply could not keep my interest. I was expecting something more along the lines of John McPhee who writes in an informative but entertaining manner.  This fits the first bill but not the second.   
 yet another book written by fanciful feminists dreaming of some (wholly imaginary) matriarchal past.  The book is full of wild unsubstantiated statements.  They talk about goddesses of the paeleolithic era, a period of which there is nothing known about religious practices or beliefs, how could there be?  The carved images of women found may be goddesses, or they may not.  We don't know.  That doesn't stop these nutty women laying down the law on the subject though.  All the authors of these batty feminist sprituality books should be made to write out the following a hundred times "WORSHIPPING GODDESSES DOES NOT MEAN A SOCIETY IS MATRIARCHAL" .History is full of partiarcahl goddess-worhsippers, Egyptian, Greek and Roman society were full of goddesses, and they were totally male-domonated societies.  And if Christianity was such a terrible male-domonated religion compared to all those lovely goddess worhsipping religions, how come they got so many women converts?  Alos they are banging on about moon goddesses as per usual, sun goddesses not getting a mention, though there were plenty.  And these women are meant to be psychologists or something, aren't they?  They both seem to me to be in urgent need of psychoanalysis themselves 
 While the concept is good, there is no way to securly fasten the blue tubes to the main body, so they keep flying off and need reattaching as each child crawls through at their normal breakneck speeds. I would avoid it to be honest. 
 Stenger believes Hill is guilty from the start and tries to make him out to be a common criminal. While Joe is no choir boy the truth is stranger than fiction. Little is known of Hill's buddy Otto Applequist, but over the years more facts have been uncovered about this man's fascinating life. Not the ... son of a Swedish minister but one of many sons of a working class family. An immigrant who becomes disillusioned with the American dream after he finds, instead of streets paved with gold, only forests, mines, docks, and streets covered with the blood of his fellow workers. Not a romantic bandit, but a revolutionary who chose to use his death sentence to bring the cause of labor to the forefront. If you want a balanced book about him get Joe Hill by Gibbs Smith.

 White Christmas was one of the best musicals to come out of Hollywood, and certainly one of the biggest holiday films of all time. It's amazing to think that record companies couldn't come to terms to produce an actual soundtrack album. Bing Crosby was contracted to Decca, and Rosemary Clooney was contracted to Columbia. Thus, there was never an "Original Soundtrack Album" made of the movie White Christmas. Instead, what was released was an album featuring Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Trudy Stevens (the dubbed-in singing voice for Vera Ellen) along with Peggy Lee substituting for the absent Rosemary Clooney. The album was called "Selections from Irving Berlin's White Christmas". It contained all the songs from the movie re-recorded with Peggy Lee.  Meanwhile, Roosemary Clooney released her own 8 song 10" EP containing her versions of most of the White Christmas songs. How confused and dissapointed the fans and record buying public must have been in 1954! This CD, "Ultimate White Christmas" is a compilation of those two discs, along with three additional unrelated Clooney holiday songs thrown in as bonus tracks. Overall, this is the closest thing you'll ever find to the elusive White Christmas soundtrack. Unfortunately, when you yearn to hear the songs as you remember them from the movie, some of these versions just don't measure up. Arrangements differ from the movie versions, and, while Peggy Lee is a fine singer in her own right, she has a totally different sound and style from Clooney. This is evident in her version of "Love You Didn't Do Right By Me". She seemed determined to make the song her own, and oversings to the point where she sounds like she's yawning into the microphone. On the Clooney tracks, the arrangements of the White Christmas songs are vastly different from the movie and, once again, leaves the listener disconnected. A few of the songs have harpsichord in them, which was never used in the movie. The three additional Clooney tracks were pulled from another '50's holiday recording and do nothing to enhance this CD. The songs "Suzy Snowflake" and "C-H-R-I-S-T-M-A-S" sounds as if they were recorded for a children's album. While I give the producer credit for the effort made to compile all the songs into one "utlimate" package, I give this CD overall low marks because of the poor digital remastering of the recordings. It sounds muddy and muffled. The packaging is also second-rate and looks as if it were done using a greeting card program on someone's home pc. This project could use major label budget and expertise. Until then, watch the movie on DVD and savor the songs as you know and love them 
 I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a "too-clean look" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off. Glad it was on TV 
 ive read dozens of reviews for this book.  the great reviews are the reason i bought the book in the first place.  they are all FALSE! this book is BORING.  i dont see ANY reason to compare this book to the harry potter series.  other than the fact that they were written by brittish woman, they're not even in the same category.  ive read more fantasy novels than i could possibly count, and this was the worst by far.  the greatest magic the magicians in this book perform are spells to "make it rain" or "make the statues talk". if your looking for a good fantasy novel, try R.A. Salvatore or Weis & Hickman.  this just isnt worth the time. i honestly would'nt have anything to say to the public about this book if it werent for all the reviews i read about what an AMAZING book this is. the only reason i gave it 2 stars is because i actually read the book from start to finish.  for some reason, i just wanted to know how it ended.  i normally read about 2 books a week...this one took me over a month to finish.  its just so boring, i couldnt read more than a few pages at a time or i would just fall asleep in my chair.  if you want real fantasy, try something else. please. 
 Coleman Barks may be a brilliant translator, but this CD was a disappointment, mostly because of the slip-shod music production. Something more rehearsed, with better sounds and creative energy would have been nice. The mood of the text is completely contradicted by the cheesy music. And for anyone that says, "well, I bet you couldn't do better." Try me. (I'm a music producer and Rumi enthusiast, and I have half a mind to see just what I can do. Give me a call Mr. Barks - w w w . m i n d s p e a k . c o  
 I completely understand and genuinely enjoy the Chinese tradition of the lion dance. It is a visually stunning and moving thing to see when done by a capable dancer. But this movie, while building to the climactic end scene, has about 500 lions dancing at the end. All of the lions are trying to defeat all the other lions, and all the while the viewer is left to be confused. Clubfoot was a great addition, but enough with the lions! .. 
 My daughter loves this toy.  She has the treehouse and the school house, she plays with them often.  My only complaint is that they fall apart.  She does not mind, I just snap it back together and she keeps playing.  
 It is not good as  a mainstream movie , it does not have a good plot , some scenes are not relevant . Even as a soft-porn movie, it does not do a good job. Try watching "I like to play games" , its a much better soft-porn movie.  
 Of Rick Moody's books, I've read "The Ice Storm" and "Garden State."  I liked both of them, although I prefer the film version of "The Ice Storm" to the novel.  So I picked up a paperback copy of "Demonology," thinking that it would be equally engaging.  I was wrong.  I couldn't make it past the first few stories, they were all very thin and flat, and as I was reading, I couldn't help but think, "Who cares?"  The first story, "The Mansion on the Hill," was unbelievably slow and tedious to get through, the same was true as I gave him another chance and started reading the subsequent stories, hoping in vain that things would get better.  A real disappointment.  I would drift off as I was reading, and could have skipped pages and still known what was going on in the plot.  A very empty, unsatisfying read.  Like expecting a steak dinner and only getting a rice cake 
 The following summarization of Petersen's book is excerpted from the book review-article titled "Unleashing the Storm," available from the website of Creation Ministries International.  "Summary  "If this review were about one or two problems or points of disagreement in a generally sound book, or if the book were such as to likely cause little impact, CMI would see little cause to risk the storm of censure that will doubtless come from many for having been this openly critical. However, the overwhelming thrust of this book falls into an extremely dubious, speculative and poorly argued category, one which may not be instantly obvious to the layperson, and much of what it argues is plain wrong. Most, if not all, of these questionable items have never been peer-reviewed in the creationist scientific journals.  "Apart from the Bible, no book, including any we publish, is perfect. But in this case, the potential for many thousands of people to be seriously misled into believing they have a major weapon, when it is a major step backwards for the creation movement, has led to this review. We also feel that this is the sort of book that your average neighborhood evolutionist will have been `waiting for', in a sense, to reinforce his prejudice that creationists do not understand evolutionary science and misrepresent it, etc. We believe that we have a responsibility to not just refrain from stocking it, but to actively warn against uncritically accepting its contents as if they were generally based on some sort of consensus from the global community of qualified creationist researchers. That would be far from reality.  "Final comment  "It is a hard thing to have to point out this tragic consequence of people `doing their own thing' in creation ministry without any sort of concession to the normal processes of peer review. It is especially hard, because the book is doubtless well-meant, and its motives good Christian ones. Readers of this review who have read the book will no doubt make their own judgment. But if the book doesn't convince creationists such as us, then readers should realize that evolutionists are even less likely to be swayed. At least readers will then be prepared when their evolutionist acquaintances gleefully commence their `demolition derby' on its contents. 
 this is basically a personal journal. The artist's ruminations about art and life - very dry reading. Rothko often contradicts himself. There are several books available (such as those published by Taschen) which are much more readable and are filled with beautiful illustrations of the artist's work 
 I have a number of Scritti Politti albums, including the incomparable Cupid and Psyche '85.  This isn't a close comparison.  Much too slow, lugubrious, contemplative.  Puts me to sleep.  Suffers from an overly simple production and uninteresting unlayered backgrounds on what sounds like one tired synth.  This isn't horrible, but given the genius of the other albums, this one suffers.  I wish I hadn't purchased this album.  
 Come on people! Even Jack Vance's zany Dying Earth novels (Cugel in particular) have more substance than this lackadaisical tour-de-force. Skip out on Burroughs, if you want quality sci-fi read the Demon Princes by Jack Vance.. 
 This is a very bad book. It is poorly written, the characters are caricatures in misery, and it is almost impossible to develop any empathy for them except for the older daughter, who suffers in silence after the devastating, and, to her, mysterious, death of her mother. Her father fails in both his calling to ministry and his responsiblities to protect his daughter. He is so distant that he believes what teachers tells him about his child's behavior, which is a perfectly legitimate childhood grief response, rather than the bad behavior that others choose to label her with indifference to her deep pain and confusion. He fails in his responsibilities to his parishoners by not realizing that he himself is mired in grief and needs a break. I couldn't finish this. It is drivel 
 Dr. George Gurganus was professor of missions at ACU. ACU is a Liberal Arts university which is supported by the Churches of Christ. The Churches of Christ were a sectarian breakoff of the original Disciples of Christ movement started by Alexander Campbell and Barton W. Stone, and other significant leaders. This was a movement to both unify and restore New Testament Christianity.  In 1898, the Church of Christ broke off as a sectarian movement, and this break became official in 1906. This sect later became a cult which believed it was the only true church on that faith of the earth. All other believers in Jesus Christ outside of this circle were not saved.  George Gurganus preached for a while with the Churches of Christ, and obtained his doctorate. He was somewhat a voice of moderation among the more hardcore Church of Christ, but remained a believer, practitioner and leader in this cult called the Churches of Christ. Later he went with the International Churches of Christ (Boston Church of Christ), as their main missions leader. Even the mainline Churches of Christ considered this new group of ICOC a cult. It was just a matter of one cult calling another church (from their own heritage) a cult.  As a former student of Dr. Gurganus, he was an excellent teacher, but harbored no dissent. His writings apply to the Churches of Christ, which still considers itself "The Lord's Church". 
 Typical left wing "vast right wing conspiracy" nonsense.  Only the most paranoid Americans looking through the peepholes of triple locked  doors would recognize the place this book is about and apparently from  where it was written 
 This book is so dense with distortions, self-loathing and flip flops, it is virtually unreadable. Even worse, the occasional sections that are comprehensible are still at best meaningless. 
 I bought this book taking a real gamble that there would really be something in it about motorcycle riding and its affect on the soul.  If you are into eastern philosphy, you may enjoy this book.  If you are looking for a good book about motorcyle riding, this is not the one I would recommend.  I will say the author writes well - I think the title is very misleading 
 I believe Ayn Rand's writings are very destructive. And this isn't because of her highly un-original philosophy. No, the reason for this is the powerful grip the books has on her followers. In her books they find  justification for behaving in a anti-social manner that is slowly  destroying the fabric of the societies of the Western World. This egoism is  supposedly derived from "reason". In the real world however there  is no reason for people not to find fulfillment and meaning from helping  others and caring for their family and friends. The accusation that  "altruism", i.e. decency and goodness, leads to tyranny is  nothing but products of a very paranoid mind. The craziest thing about this  though is the fact that Ayn Rand has been raised to a saint-like status by  her followers. No disagreement with her writings is ever accepted and if  you disagree you are an evil communist/collectivist. To be a true  individualist you must agree with everything she has ever written. Isn't  this collectivism in a true sense? No, says her followers, those views are  derived by reason and must therefore be share by all intelligent human  beings. Pretty scary!! Note that Objectivism, like Marxism, Freudianism and  Jungianism, is a closed system of thought in the sense that any critisism  of the system is automatically seen as a symptom of unreason. This is what  makes Objectivism a religion rather than a philosophy or scientific method.  And this is also the reason for the fanatical behavior of her disciples 
 Got this for my nephew for his birthday.  One week later (4 uses) it was broken.  He still uses the cup - my brother tried to fix it - nothing.  Would not recommend unless you want a cup only.  Again - concept great but it didn't hold up after 4 uses 
 "A long way out in the deep blue sea there lived a fish. Not just an ordinary fish, but the most beautiful fish in the entire ocean."  This is a book I have some trouble with.  It is beautifully illustrated, and the glittery silver scales make it very appealing to children. However, I am not entirely sure it is sending the right message. I like to give the author the benefit of the doubt that he meant well, that the overall message is that vanity and posessions will not make you happy.   But ultimately the solution to the Rainbow fish's problems give unclear messages, and can possibly be interpretated that to make friends you need to buy them.  Other interpretations have been covered comprehensively in other reviews and include possible biass towards communist values and a want for sameness 
 Fox is releasing all these so-called "best of" disks of their shows, only AFTER releasing the first seasons.  This is absured and insulting to the fans that have bought the complete seasons and to fans of the shows in general.  < 
 maybe because I didn't like Porco. Everything was sub-par for me. Animation is definitely not as good as his later movies. Not enough weirdness, tried too much for the plot. Everything was just too ho-hum. As if he tried to carry the whole movie on Porco's shoulders. But once you got past the fact that everyone else was human and Porco was a pig there wasn't anything else there. 
 Hard to grasp. A following sentence will contradict the sentence above. Ravings not musings. If read by a believer it is great writing. If read by a stoic it's ragtime.   "In order to love God you must hate yourself." ?? 
 I gave it 1 star because there are no 0's. Absolutely horrible. No story line, extremely bad acting. Boring movie from start to finish. Do not buy this movie. The DVD cover is very inviting, but there is no way I would even watch it on cable TV if I knew 
  	Picture this, you're a regular kid, trying to make friends and fit in, and the way you do it is by committing a robbery. That isn't the smartest thing to do, now is it? You decide that it won't be a big deal if you just "look out" while your new friends do the real robbery part. Then, your plan backfires completely on you and you end up in jail. This is what happens to Steve Harmon in Walter Dean Myer's novel titled Monster. This book is a realistic fiction novel and not a very difficult read. Walter Dean Myers does an amazing job of showing what Steve is like. He makes Steve an easy character to relate to by making him like any other kid. That's just until Steve gets put into jail!  This book is written as an autobiography that the main character writes...while doing time in jail. Why did Steve end up in jail? Simply because he was the look out of a robbery? Nope, you have to read the book to figure out with specifics! I would recommend this book to almost any type of readers of all ages. Especially for people like me that enjoy reading Walter Dean Myer's work. It is written fantastically and I think could be one of Walter Dean Myer's best! 
 My alarm clock is set at 3:40. Superhero underwear is cool. CD Drives blink. I got a concussion from the fire alarm. Puppies will conquer the world. Wonder Woman Would beat up Superman. U r the coolest person in the world. Thank you for looking at this useless revie 
 This was the most useless book I have ever read on being a parent.  The author goes on and on about how painful and excruciating breastfeeding is, and how all "girlfriends" can relate to this pain if they are breastfeeding.  Huh??  If she had read any books on breastfeeding at all or gotten some basic advice from a lactation consultant, she would realize that her baby was latched on incorrectly and would have corrected the problem.  Also, she talks about girlfriends hiding from their husbands in the house so that they can breastfeed?  What?!?!  This book just infuriated me, it was so shallow and pointless, I feel like the author lives in a world all her own, inhabited by stepford wife-like "girlfriends" who struggle incessantly with mothering a new baby and have to hide everything from their dumb husbands who are completely incompetent.  How insulting!!  Don't waste your time or money on this garbage 
 Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more "progressive" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever!  Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting 
 I have read just about everything written with regard to eating disorders since about the beginning of time, and this book stands out as one of the starkest examples of someone trying to exploit the disease and make a career out of being a "recovered eating disorder."  Aside from this, the book offers no insight that cannot be found in any other routine book on eating disorders.  A waste of my money, and even more disappointing, a waste of my time 
 Awful!  This book skews scripture and twists it in ways that gave me a stomach ache.  Sorry for the crude review, but this book really is very misleading on the subjects it reports to deal with.  It is typical of some dispensationalist interpretations that use a flat, un-nuanced hermeneutic in "piecing" together their system.  For a truly accurate assesment of these issues try a little work by Vern Poythress titled, Understanding Dispensationalists 
     This is perhaps the most vile comic book I have read in years... but before you people dismiss my review, let me explain.  I have read comics with content, and the content of this book doesn't bother me, what does bother me however, is what is said at the begining of the sieries.  "this is a metaphore"  how sick and wrong is that?  The auther of this doesn't need to defend what is actualy in the series, all he has to say to people who dislike it is "well, you don't get it."  Even if it is a metaphore for anything (which I doubt, or it is quite weak) it ruins the thing by declaring it beforehand. the idead behind a metaphore is that it is a mesage that is cleverly disguised.       This series goes absolutely nowhere.  there is no real ending. Is that a metaphore to?  I know that people will hate me for saying this, but it isnt a good series.  Sorr 
 	What a ripoff! First of all, of the 25 magazine titles featured, only 8 could be called "macabre pulps" in the generally accepted meaning of the term. (And if you count cover images rather than titles, the macabre pulp representation is even smaller.) And at most only five more titles could be considered pulps at all, even if you stretch the term to include some quasi-pulp publications. As to the rest, though most are fantasy or occult related, very few are in the "macabre" category, and none of them are pulps by any stretch! These include: seven post-pulp era digests published as recently as 1973, including one that contains no fiction; a fanzine; three standard size (8 ½ by 11) non-macabre magazines published during the pulp era, including two that contain no fiction; and a standard sized post-pulp era non-fiction magazine. The book's text is extremely skimpy, for the most part merely recounting some publishing information gleaned from the indicia of the magazines. If the author is an expert on pulps, you'd never know it from this book. For each title there's a listing of all the articles and stories, by author, which is OK, although for the most part these writers are probably best forgotten. The biggest problem with the book is that the text is artificially bulked up, with the checklists in large type and spread out across the pages. There are only 104 cover reproductions in this 111 page book, but because text and checklists take up so much space, many of the covers are reproduced quite small. (I know--this is like the classic complaint about the restaurant that serves terrible food--and in such small portions!) If the contents checklists had been printed in small type two or three columns per page (preferably in the back of the book), the cover illustrations printed in a larger size, more pulp titles added to the book, and the book's title changed to "Some Randomly Selected, Mostly Rare, Short-Run, Macabre, Occult and Fantasy Magazines Published Between 1919 and 1973," the book would still be a ripoff, but might barely be worth the Amazon discount price to the curious. This is the bottom of the barrel from Adventure House! If you want a good book on the pulp era, try their UNCOVERED, THE HIDDEN ART OF THE GIRLIE PULPS, which is chock full of pulp covers and has an extremely informative text by Douglas Ellis, or their reasonably priced Belarski cover collection 
 I have never met anybody that has ear-holes big enough for these! I even tried SuperGlue to put the things that fit inside the ear! That didnt work, so now I have a wire that plugs into my phone that is supposed to give me stereo sound & talk sitting in the seat next to me. I would not reccomend these to anybody. Truth Hurts & these Hurt My Ears 
 As other reviewers have said, this book is extremely short. It barely covers the topics, certainly not in depth. If all you wanted is this tiny bit of information, you would be better off doing some web searches. It's not worth the 8+ dollar cost, not even close. If you want an excellent book I would go with MouthSounds by Fred Newman. It's an excellent book all around, and includes an audio CD with examples. The book covers all types of whistles more in depth than this book covers two types of whistles as well as many, many other mouth sounds such as other instruments and voices. Stick with MouthSounds and give this book a wide pass 
 "The Accidental" by first-time Scottish novelist Ali Smith has to be one of the most irritating books I've read in a very long time.  It's so modern, it's really hard to tell what happened or why you should care about it.  This book won the Whitbread Novel Award.  According to another website, the Whitbread Award lost its sponsor and ceased to exist the same year.  Would it be fair to label this book as the one that killed the Whitbread Award?   The jacket also labels this book as a finalist for the Man Booker Prize whose website says that they award "the very best in contemporary fiction."  For me a requirement of the very best fiction is to be able to affect the reader in a positive way.  My only positive is that I finally got to the end of a dreadful book; & no, it did not get better.  Eve Smart is a novelist.  I usually try to avoid books where writers write about writers.  It's like a movie about movie stars or a song about songwriting -- it seems quintessentially self-indulgent.  Who knows what happens to Eve at the end of the book?  Why is she in some lady's house near the Grand Canyon?  Is it just to present another character as irritatingly self-absorbed as the main character?  Why is Eve unconcerned about her children?  Why does she see her dead mother floating above the Grand Canyon when this wasn't a book about her parents?  Wouldn't it have been more interesting to have her be eaten by a mountain lion?   Michael is Eve's husband.  He's a university professor that sleeps with his students.  His wife Eve knows and doesn't care.  Are they progressive people because they sleep around?  Is this supposed to make us care about them?  What is the effect of their loose behavior on their two children?  Do we care or applaud when Michael gets fired?    Astrid is the youngest child.  She is going through typical adolescent behaviors.  Yes, she is one of the most real of the characters, but she doesn't change throughout the book.  She gets mad at her mother for not being home and refuses to speak to Eve when she calls on the phone.  Astrid was right to be mad at Eve, but so what?  Magnus, the son, was the most interesting character to me simply because he loses his virginity in a church.  It's a bit of a mixed message from author Ali Smith.  What does it say about the church?  Is the message that "The Accidental" is man because there is no God proved because the church is empty?  Who knows?  Amber shows up as the family summers in Suffolk or Norfolk as Eve tries to write.  She buddies up with Astrid smashing her expensive camera.  She has sex with Magnus.  She insults Eve and gives her a knee massage.  She kisses Eve on the lips, right before Eve leaves for the Grand Canyon.  She ignores Michael.  Who is Amber?  Why is she in the book?  Magnus tells Astrid he knows who Amber is after she's disappeared, but Smith fails to let the readers know.  Is this a puzzle?  An illusion?  A nightmare?  Then when the family returns home, their house has been completely stripped.  Who did that?  What's the point?    I did not care for Smith's repetitious use of pages of short sentences.  It doesn't further the story.  It basically just says, "Look at me.  I can write in short sentences."  However, it was enough to have her awarded the Whitbread Novel Award.  I didn't mind the poetry.  I liked it because I could get through the book faster.  To what point it was there, I cannot say.  Perhaps you will be more modern than I and not particularly care if a story makes sense or whether there is anybody about which to care.  For me, this is an award-winning dud.  Taxi!                
 This book is poor.  The editing is horrible with lots of confusing language 
 This book is based off of a complete misconception of the truth, it has no founding nor fact in our Fathers word and just goes to show how far people using their own imagination can go.  If you like fiction read this book. But remember its just that fiction.  If you would like truth, read and understand our Fathers word.   To get you on your way. Take any King James version of the Bible and read Mark 13. You will see the two tribulations that Christ defines there. Notice verse 14 defines the fake Christ and verse 24 defines the return of the true Christ. Also note how Christ defines the deception of the fake Christ in verse 19.  Also read 2Thessalonians chapter 2 verses 2-4 , you will see Satan must be worshipped as if he were Christ, right there in Our Fathers temple, before the True Christ returns.  Read revelation chapter 12 verses 7-9, you will see Satan is kicked out of heaven to Earth where he will war with the saints. Note he was kick out with his angles, he's not going to let some man be part of his show. No united nations chief will play the role of the fake christ...thats just complete stupidity.  Read Daniel chapter 7, Revelation chapter 7, Revelation chapter 13, and Revelation 17, You will find the truth in these verses about Satans beast (one world) system that he will use to deceive 99.8% of mankind with.  Heck ... Revelation 12:3 tells you he did it to us before. Further Revelation 13:11 tells us he will look just like Christ (the lamb of God) but he speaks like satan (the dragon).   Revelation 13:13-14 tells us he does great miracles and can make fire come down from heaven in the sight of men, and he uses this power to deceive most of the people...Now I don't know about you but I have never seen anyone leading the united nations that has this type of supernatural power...Have you?    Don't be deceived its Christs #1 warning in Mark 13. The very first warning he gives "Take heed lest any MAN deceive you"  So don't be deceived by this book...its not the word of our Father...its just fiction from the minds of men, not truth from the word of God 
 Why, Why, WHY are people giving this DVD four stars? Please, can some idiotic TNA fan actually give a good argument for this worthless piece of sh*t? Christopher Daniels definately deserves better than this. Unlike glorified stuntmen like Jeff Hardy and AJ Styles, who get two disk dvd releases, Christopher Daniels actually mat wrestles, and no AJ Styles defense written review/praise of TNA "wrestling" rant can make me think otherwise.  At least World Wrestling Entertainment can put on a good DVD rlease, just look at "Hard Knocks, The Chris Benoit Story, Cheating Death, Stealing Life, The Eddie Guerrero Story." Those are great DVD rleases for true wreslters. Daniels should have been in that category of a DVD release, but TNA dropped the ball ONCE again....  You people really need to stop spending your money on DVD's like this and watch some WWE DVDS. They may be 5 - 7 dollars more [Don't believe me? go to best buy or wal-mart] but at least they give all their matches in their entirety and show some great stories about the wrestlers themselves as well. [Unlike Ultimate Warrior, but that's a different story.]  Review Written By:  - Chain Gang Soldier [Just to p*ss you guys off even more]  Bring on the criticism people, if you have the testicular fortitude for it.. 
 I loved this series- I could not stop reading each and every one of them cover to cover up until this piece of garbage.  Its almost like TG handed over his writing to an author of much much lessor quality - like one of those cheesy books based off of a video game like "Starcraft" or something.  It is sad.  I still finished this book, but man I could not wait for it to end!!!  Boring, with a plot that made you hate every character introduced.  This reminds me of the new Eddings books- I loved all his old work, but really really hate his new stuff... its almost like they stopped thinking when writing and play to a 'dumber' audience!  I will get the next one in the series- just in case he can pick up the pieces...sigh 
 There's no one complete song on this album. I was fooled and hope my advise may prevent others from falling in this trap. I love Pink Floyd and hoped to listen and see they perform but nothing like that happens in this DVD 
 Repetitive magical drivel for people who want to stick in a rut. Better to get a life instead 
 I couldn't really finish this book, although it was interesting as history of religion it was pretty dry 
 Random conversation with guitar feedback behind it, clips of read newspaper articles,\a baby's heartbeat...that's bad. There are two tracks I like here: Two Minutes Silence (You'd be hard pressed to find a more self-explanitory title) and Radio Airplay, nice idea behind the latter. At least you get music. Terrible, like Two Virgins and Wedding Album, but I have to say it's the best of the bunch 
 22 stellar reviews of this, I am flabbergasted.

 Who decided to cast Jessica Alba for this film? For those of you who admire her accent, you're way off! My mother was born in Malaysia, and there's a lot more to the accent than just broken English. Not to mention she looks nothing like the part. Did the casting director say, "Jessica's part-Mexican, ethnic enough -- she can play a Southeast Asian!" JA may be beautiful, but the interchanging is downright insulting, like lumping all the brown people together. Of all the "Asian" women in the trailer, it's so plain to see she's not! Were Asian women not attractive enough for the lead role? Are there not enough of them for a casting call, the most populous race? Actors can only "become" someone different to a degree. After watching the trailer, I was so disgusted I couldn't even give the movie a chance. It would only rile me up. Skip this movie, and ditch all its claims of cultural sensitivity 
 Although the concept behind this book is quite original, the actual writing comes off as insipid and hollow. A Madman Dreams of Turing Mechanics parallels the lives of two brilliant, though tormented, mathematicians. Their lives overlap, though not in time or place, in an abstract sense, brought together by their work as scientists and their psychological troubles.  The story is really about two intellects whose lives revolve around their science and the dissonance between them and the rest of the world. This fascinating premise is all that bumps Levin's novel up to two stars.  The prose are irritating and often riddled with analogies to physics and math. The sparse dialogue between characters sounds less like two people talking and more like a mechanically crafted conversation between the author and... the author. The story never comes together as promised in the first few pages of the novel. We are led to believe in the title that there is a madman, a third intellect, that plays some roll in bringing the two stories together. Throughout the book, short tidbits of first person narrative remind us of this lurking presence. Shockingly, our narrator never steps into the forefront, never becomes a meaningful character.   My overwhelming reaction to the novel: why did I read this book?   
 The publishers made a typo error in this book's title - they added an "f".  Instead of "Another Life", it should more appropriately be titled "Another Lie."  Although it is a  well-written and fairly entertaining memoir, it is the Napoleonic ambitions  of its author that make it a very dubious and unreliable addition to any  non-fiction library.  Due to Michael Korda's supremely fragile ego, always  in danger of having to be placed in intensive care, everything in this book  must be viewed very skeptically.  Korda not only takes credit for himself  but distorts and erroneously states facts so that he can be the hero and  the mastermind.  After reading a few chapters, I became suspicious of  Korda's "memory" when he always appeared as the brilliant,  all-knowing catalyst of every event he was participating in.  When I came  to his chapter on his relationship with Graham Greene, I had the sense he  was exaggerating his teenage friendship with the famous author - logic just  wasn't on Korda's telling of the tale, especially since none of the  principals are alive to offer a differing view, as is true for most of  Korda's stories.  But, as for facts, I decided to do some research and  check what Korda was relating about his publshing career.  Alas, he has  created more fiction than fact in relating these tales.  I could write half  a book on his lies and misrepresentations, but I merely use one case in  point.  His experience with the bestselling novelist Susan Howatch.  On  pages 309 and 3l0 Korda presents Howatch as "some unknown woman in New  Jersey sitting at her kitchen table and holding her baby as she wrote"  the book which HE discovered and became the best seller  "Penmarric".  This was l970 and Korda paints the scene as if he  is plucking an unknown first author and using HIS great judgment to  determine that she, indeed, has written a great book.  ACTUALLY, Susan  Howatch had begun writing novels in l965 and was a successful and respected  author of three novels published by Stein & Day by the time Korda  caught up with her. It's rather clumsy and absurd to present her as his  discovery, BUT Korda goes on to state that he perceptively noticed the  subtle parallel between "Penmarric"'s plot and the lives of Henry  II and Eleanor of Aquitaine.  He relates how Howatch reluctantly confessed  to having borrowed the historical plot and was nervous that someone else  might also notice.  Korda, fully confident of his own superior brillance,  assured her that no one would, and he states that they went ahead and  published the book and not one reviewer commented on the Henry and Eleanor  similarities.  HOW CURIOUS.  Especially since Howatch's book states in  passages at the beginning of every chapter the Henry and Eleanor story and  how it applies to the following chapter.  She plainly wrote the parallel  right there in the book and used it for the structure of her novel.  And  every book review commented on this fact, especially the New York Times,  who thought it added greatly to the book's success.  What is Korda talking  about!  I'm afraid every chapter is filled with such self-serving lies and  erroneous facts that only serve to elevate poor little Michael Korda's  sense of self-importance.  The real crime here is how Korda gets away with  these very easily checkable lies and how his legendary Editor, Robert  Loomis of Random House, can allow this obvious distortion of truth to get  publish.  It's just not sloppy and careless editing, for which the aging  Loomis is becoming famous, it is the deliberate distortion of their own  industry and a real lowering of standards. This collaboration of Korda and  Loomis and its careless and fictionalized view of the New York book world  is far more eloquent than anything Mr. Korda has to say in his book. Yes,  book publishing really has gone downhill, and Korda and Loomis have taken  it another giant leap 
 This is not my first facial sauna but it is the worst I've used.  The "Cold" function does not work well (not significantly enough at least) but the hot function works fine.  It tends to leak the water you put in, even if you keep it below the max-fill line.  
 We have had two of these things and both are nothing but junk!  That they charge $20 for it is a crime!  It gets jammed with every turn and it only increases the waste of stickers and tape.  Don't spend a precious dime on this piece of junk toy 
 One of the best books for first course in topology. There is some weakness in the second part, but for the first course of topology this book is great. 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck

 As someone who has been a Paulo Coelho fan, this book is a disappointment. If you do like Paulo's books, please avoid this particular one.   Once you read the book, you get the feeling that the story is quite pointless. Yeah, sure it illuminates the life of a prostitute and circumstances surrounding the same (with some restraint I might add) but fails to deliver any insight into life or its meaning.   Paulo's strength - his ability to take the 'helicopter' view into all things in life is tested and does not stand up. While he does make an effort to look for "sacred sex" and introduces S&M, it is quite apparent that he is not convinced himself.   In a sense, you are left with the sensation of seeing a very expensive car grind to a halt at a cheap motel where the protagonists step out for their eleven minutes.  Avoid this novel - it is a series of disconnected events which don't really mean much 
 Listen to the introduction to both songs and you will see.  But I guess all the 80s bands used each other's stuff.  Lot's of dated, cheesy synthesizer sounds.  These are good to study if you want to do a lounge act that includes the sounds of the 80s.  Why people like us born in the 1980s and later want to hear this stuff when they could at least hear real rock is strange to me.  It's weird how people can keep repackaging these albums to make money 
 Characters are flat. I don't really care about the Art and Music.  Murder mystery was so boring I found out that I didn't care who killed him.  Read 3/4 of the book and shut the pages 
 This is not a how to book. This is a picture book. The author is a consumate artist, no doubt about that, but the publishers have marketed it in such a way as to suggest that you...the reader...will learn how it can be done. Not true. The author merely shows countless numbers of his own work. This leaves you to guess how it can be done. If you are a fan of the authors work then add this to your collection. If you want a book on how to render lighting effects in your own work then pass this book bye 
 Worked OK for about a day and a half, then it would go off every few minutes for no reason. Changed batteries several times, to no avail. Changed position in case squirrels or cats triggered it. Moved it from place to place, even watched the scene, and still sounded the alarm for no reason. This is a piece of junk that will drive your dog crazy. !!! AVOID !! 
 Mostly bereft of scenery or any notice of local lifeways, hardly a travel book at all, Hindoo Holiday strikes me as being a vicious portrait of his host and benefactor, a maharajah who, like Ackerley, was on the self-defeating quest for the devotion of an Ideal Friend, and, like Ackerley, looking in all the wrong places for love. Ackerley's book is condescending to Indians in the colonial British manner that was abhorrent to Foster both in his time in India and in his masterpiece A Passage to India, Hindoo Holiday is notable for a lack of empathy on Ackerley's part, but, then, in his entire oeuvre, it is only the irritations and heartbreaks of his surrogates that matter. Ackerley was far too solipsistic to be a novelist 
 I find the author's unqualified, and rather anectodal, anthropological conclusions about a 100 years out of date("barbarian" and "savage" aren't scientific terms).  Rather than quoting primary sources so support his facts he seems to prefer re-interpreting them in his own bias; on occasion I happened to have read the source text and found he had grossly misrepresented it, which makes me very suspicious of the rest of his facts. The whole book is extremely biased in favour of manifest destiny - it often reads like a justification for destructions of the native peoples and their culture.  
 I have to rate this at 1 star for the time being since pages 179-242 are missing.  Instead I have two sets of pages 243 - 306.  
 I bought the 2006 edition of this book automatically, as I have for a number of years.  I am extremely disappointed with the totally revised content, as I find it much more difficult to use.  While it would seem logical to group the records together as done in the new volume, it just doesn't work for me.  The old layout of team info, with each team starting at the top of a page, has been junked, and the results are not pretty.  Furthermore, this is now just a record book; the old "facts" sections, including a review of the preceding season and a preview of the new season, have disappeared.  I'm keeping my 2005 edition and trashing the 2006.  I hope Sporting News comes to their senses and arranges the 2007 edition like the 2005 and prior editions.  "It wasn't broke, but they 'fixed' it anyway. 
 I am supposed to get 16th edition, instead I received 15th edition. The book was completely changed from the previuos editio 
 The lack of character development in this book was disappointing. There was not one character that I was able to identify with, sympathize with, or even care about. When I reached the end, I felt sorry for the time I had invested in reading the book. 
 THE DVD HAS A VERY POOR RECORDING,YOU CAN'T HEAR THE AUDIO BECAUSE IT CONTINUE TO BREAK AND THE PICTURE FREEZES . I HAVE A RETURN TAG FOR THE FRIST ONE THAT WASN'T PLAYING .I JUST WANT TO NOTIFIED YOU THAT I AM GOING TO RETURN BOTH DVD. I WILL SUGGEST THAT NEXT ONE WILL BE TESTED AND MAKE SURE IS PLAYING VERY WELL IN VIDEO AND AUDIO.      THANK YOU. 
 As the pitching coach for a junior college team, I bought this book hoping for something new--some revelations, so to speak. Sorry, nothing new here. In fact, the book seems to have no connective thread. It doesn't even read like a book. Just a bunch of disconnected ramblings. One of the few interesting interviews was with Leo Mazzone, the Atlanta Braves pitching coach. Unfortunately, Mazzone said nothing that he hadn't already said in his own book, Pitching Like a Pro. (No surprise there.) Mazzone's book is a slim paperback that you could own for half the price of this book. Kahn's concept is a good one. The chess game between pitcher and batter, especially played out at the highest level of the game, is worthy of a book-length treatment. Too bad Kahn couldn't close the deal 
 Sorry, but I could not follow this book.  Not only was it not going where I wanted to go it kept dropping me off and leaving me nowhere.  In almost every chapter I'd just start to get into the project and turn the page and it was like the pages got jumbled up at the printers, a new chapter would start and we're doing a new unrelated project.  I never knew where I was going or why.  I can only imagine that if you are very Right brained you might be able to work with this book.  I'm very Left-Brained.  I got to about page 90 and gave up trying to make any sense of it. I did get a couple pointers that were nice to have, but I don't know if they were worth the $ I spent for it.  I'm going to let my business partner read it and see if it works any better for him.  
 This book was utterly boring. It is a cutesy attempt at satire, only the entire time, I kept thinking, "Edith Wharton did it better." The problem with Lewis's version of what a satire is is that satire is supposed to be subtle; outright criticism of the characters and lifestyles is almost insulting to the reader's intellect.  The other issue I have with Babbitt is its long-winding lead-up, unsatisfying climax, and disappointing denouement. The plot took too long to manifest itself, and this was largely due to Lewis's incisions of "clever" critique into the narrative.   As a short story, this novel would've worked out brilliantly. However, spanning three hundred pages as it is, it's a long, drab waste of time 
 While very attractive this desk suffers from what so many inexpensive computer desks do an inadequately sized keyboard drawer.   There is enough room for the keyboard but not enough for a mouse.  This results in forcing you to have to reach forward to use the mouse on the top of the desk. I ultimately decided just put he keyboard on top the desk and raise up my chair.  The manufacturer should consider eliminating one of the drawers and extending the keyboard shelf 
 One of the most worthless and poorly-thought-out games I have ever had the extreme displeasure to play.  The gameboard is warped and doesn't sit flat, so the pieces slides around and players lose their places.  The card "ejector" doesn't work, period.  We finally took the cards out and made a draw pile on the table, which pretty much wiped out the only possibly novel aspect of the game.  My kids were bored silly, even though they thoroughly enjoyed the movie of the same name.  Don't waste your time or money.  
 I am using this book for J2EE study. After reading chapter 1 and 2, I have to say this is one of the worst tech books I ever read. The materials are harshly composed, often without a consistent and clear framework on various topics (what an irony on a book about a framework). From time to time, I have the impression that the authors just pulled some paragraphs from various articles and piled them together. This gives me the further impression that the authors don't really understand those subjects well enough to distill the essentials out and present them in an organized manner. Unless you are already an expert in those subjects, you will find yourself confused by this book and walk away with more questions than before.  Definitely not recommended for anybody 
 I used to enjoy Iris Johansen.  This book is a super natural psychic thing. The book flap describes it as "psychological thriller", but it's not.  If you enjoy the super natural type of book (Stephen King, etc) then this is good.  If, like me, you dislike that type of book, STAY AWAY from this one.  The main character Kerry can get into peoples minds.  The other main character also does that.  Yes,that is the basis of this book 
 I've read every Dale Brown book published. This is not the same old Dale Brown we are used to. Hope it gets better from here, or I am done 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 When I saw this book, I thought that it was going to be another book along the lines of "Girlfriend Guide"  or "Hip Momma's".  I was so utterly wrong!  The book takes excerpts from many other pregnancy books which I have read, and in most all instances they are taken wildly out of context from the original.  I guess my biggest dissapointment is that the book is heavily religious...  While most other pregnancy books written "on the level" have small blurbs, this one is chalked full of christianized jargon.  While the back cover does say "spiritual encouragement" the rest of the description made it seem like it would be for the yoga going, jucie bar hitting types.  Although the book does give month to month checklists and a few really great websites to check out, it is really lacking in good, original information.  I would strongly suggest not purchasing this book, and going for "Girlfriends Guide" instead.  It does have "Expert panel" sections, that make you feel not so alone. However, this information would be best gotten out of one of the many pregnancy magazines, which offer the same thing.  All in all I was really dissapointed by this book, especially after reading many other pregnancy books.  I guess that this book would have been alot better if it were the very first book that I read, and if I did not know anything at all about pregnancy 
 If I like the way an author writes, I give that author's genres, other than mystery, a chance. These stories have become boring.  I am going back to her FBI and crime fiction.  Her plots are still fine there 
 Enough? Bill McKibbon's had ENOUGH of the biotechnology revolution? He hasn't seen anything yet. The best is yet to be imagined.. 
 Kids will like... for as long as it lasts. And it won't last long. I also found the way the basket attaches to the wheel base to become a cart annoying. The darn thing falls off all the time and eventually I threw it out. It just frustrated the kids at church nursery. Better off seeking a sturdier option. Even for a household with jsut one kid -- this thing is flimsy. It def. won't work for a situation where many kids will be using it (church nursery, preschool, etc. 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 This Audio CD was produced in very poor quailty, in terms of the sound and by the person reading it.  It would be nice if it was the true voice of Wallace Wattles - because I'd keep it just for sentimental reasons, but it sounds like it was recorded in about 1970 in a closet with a $50 tape recorder.  The reader is not professional - being short to of breath to speak whole sentences, and they are very monotone without expression (and I love this book so much, I want to hear it with some amount of conviction, strength and joy!)  If you want a better audio version than this - simply record yourself 
 While installing Norton Antivirus 2007 XP, a Norton message flashed that I must delete Webroot for MSN. I did it, and it resulted in crashing the session.  Tried first the paying phone support and gave up after 2 hrs wait. Then ried the online chat. The wait went on for 9hrs, started #245 in the queue and by now in lline at #59 I realized this was not the Norton I'd used for so many years, I ordered Kapersky anti-virus.       
 Two cents from a rank amateur/beginning programmer. At the moment, I'm on page 179 of this book and the main problem I have so far is with the way the information is communicated. Personally, I now know that I should have picked up a book that taught VB concepts via small projects and tasks. A "in chapter 1 we'll build a simple tool to get familiar w/ the IDE. In chapter 2 we'll improve our skillset by building a slightly advanced tool to learn about declaring variables, etc." approach would work better for me. Unfortunately, this book doesn't  really do that. The concepts here are explained mostly with bits of standalone code. Hopefully, perhaps by page 200, we'll commence with some "learning by doing." Yes, hopefully. In the meantime, I'll grit my teeth and continue with the book, but right now it simply isn't working for me 
 most of it is funny as hell, and it's hard to argue with the vast majority of the don'ts.  the thing is, most of it is also racist, homophobic, transphobic and generally hateful. that will probably encourage people to get it, but whatever. i don't know who told hipsters it's OK to be evil as long as you pretend it's just irony and sarcasm, but if i did, i would have to administer a beatdown.  borrow it or steal it if you must, but don't buy it.  sheesh 
 While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.  So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?  I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.  Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.    
 Thus, with the quote from the film above, goes the movie Shark Attack 3.  All of the negative feedback about this film is true.  Rather than go on about what has been stated well already, though, here are what I believe are the most memorable lines that make this film uber cliched:  "You're extinct, F-er!"  "My lawyers will have a field day with you.  THEY are the real sharks."  "I'm really wired.  So why don't I take you home and eat your _____."  (after destroying the megalodon) "Mega-la-who?" (laughter) "Hey, where are the cocktails?"  This is the kind of dialogue you can expect from the film.  These are the highlights.  Of course, I am not pointing out all the excellent grunting and 'roaring" that the sharks expel, but I don't want to give everything away.  Well, one more thing: audiences find out that boats are commonplace within a prehistoric shark's diet.  Why would you, dear viewer, want to watch this 
 I purchased this book looking for information on specific methods of financing my pre-startup with little of my own money.  I read the book in it's entirety and here is what it is:  A wonderful personal story of winning and losing in business.  It shows that creativity can be used to overcome lack of cash, but gives few useful ideas.  Like I said, it's just a nice story, not a business resource 
 While this book does cover several main grammar points, it is difficult to use and poorly designed.  First of all, rather than offer the beginning student examples of useful conversations it offers lectures.  So instead of learning how to have a conversation we start out learning about Maha and that her father works at the U.N.  ANY beginning language book should be based on daily conversation types of dialogue.  Secondly, the type is rather 'fuzzy' and important short vowel and pronunciation symbols (written above and below the main script) are often either left off or completely illegible.  While it is true that in advance Arabic these symbols are often not shown, for a beginner they are very important.  Another poor design charastic of the book is that the table of contents is listed almost exclusively in Arabic so if a beginner needs to make a quick reference to something they can spend hours trying to find where it is located in the book.  The accompanying DVDs are a great idea but not very well done.  The language is given too quickly - more at the rate of an intermediate or advanced level - and there is no accompanying written dialogue to help the student figure out what is being said.  The Vocabulary on the DVD often times has a huge, long sentence to show how to use a single, small word. BEginners learn more easily and much more quickly when they are given small, bite size bits that they can easily digest and use in everyday conversations. (I created my own work around to this by having native Arabic speakers record the vocabulary words for me on an MP3 player)  While the grammar concepts tend to be well explained, there are not enough exercises to practice the concepts after the explanation.  A really great idea would have been to have lots of exercises WITH answers so that the student could immediately check their work and see if they are on the right track or not.  Instead the student has to buy the answer key... and the answer key is very difficult to read!  Also, the end of each chapter should have a brief synopsis of all grammar points gone over in the chapter so if the student wants a quick glance to refresh their memory, they aren't leafing through countless pages of fuzzy, black and white print.  This book seems to be the standard at the moment for a lot of colleges and universities offering Arabic language courses and I'm not sure why it is.  In a day of Adobe Illustrator and other text languages it would be fairly easy to create a nice text with color type to highlight important points and other key grammar issues.  In summary:  Lacks practical conversation practice. Has very poor type quality Offers no way for students to check their work Poor table of contents DVD soundfiles too much for beginner students.  On the plus side, it does explain grammar points well.  
 Not what I was looking for, small print and not easy shortcuts. I know how to do the math the long method.  I was looking for things you can do in your head for a rough estimate 
 ZERO stars. If you live in Europe, forget about it. This thing only works on PC's with an all American time & date system. Unless you want to americanize your computer, it's not usable. Americans could also have some complaints, for instance that the "book" (real paper) that's included is unreadable because it's glued to the carton - and all the selected articles are unreadable anyway because it's only one page, continued on a following page which is NOT included in the book. Furthermore you have to insert DVD's all the time: you can't copy them to your hard drive, no no, INSERT DVD, that's the way. It's EIGHT dvd's: whenever you click an article, you have to insert this or that dvd... This thing has an impractible, arrogant, snobbish and non-cosmopolite air about it - and reading a few articles, one thinks: what's the fuss about anyway? Famous names, sometimes, but not the best those famous names ever wrote, and the rest of the articles (99%) is trash. Chic, expensive but empty magazine fodder, nothing else. Best thing is the old ads, but they tire very quick. Back issues of Vogue and Cosmo would be much more entertaining. This is the first time I will return an item to Amazon 
 I am reviewing the audio version of the book.  I would give this zero stars if I could, only because of the narration.  As usualy, Dave Barry is very funny, but it doesn't come through in this version because it's impossible to get past the narrator's reading.  In a word, he is AWFUL.  He sounds like a combination between a bad Paul Harvey impersonator and the adult voice of Ralphie in "A Christmas Story."  His timing and inflection are totally wrong for the material and he completely ruins the whole book.  I couldn't get through one of the five CDs before I wanted to throw the thing out the window.  It would have been great if they had used someone like Harry Anderson (who played a fictionalized version of Dave on TV a few years ago) to read this, and then perhaps Barry's humor would have come through.  If you like Dave Barry, skip the audio book and read the paper version 
 Bad News ! The DVD what I purchased from you, I cannot see, you send a copy with an " Incorrect Region Code " which in South Africa I cannot play back.  I spent lots of money to purchase, and to receive the parcel at the post office, but it is too much trouble to send it back.Therefore I justleave it as it is but of course, I amnot happy with the transaction.

 So you may be wondering why the 1 star review...  It's because I bought the Audio CD and the recording stinks!  I mean really stinks, as in, it was recorded in computer dragon speak and you can't understand it at all except for the occasional "so says poor Richard".  This has been a great lesson to me in purchasing audio books from unknown publishers.  I feel ripped off.  Don't make the same mistake yourself 
 As an arcaheology student studying vernacular architecture, I found this particular text to be a waste of time. It does nothing for the history of architecture, nor does it lend itself to coherent reading 
 Anyone with any life experience, and, especially, business experience and savy would know 90% of this stuff. Anyone who isn't already aware of it shouldn't be thinking about starting a business in the first place. The list of resources is of some value, so I didn't give it one star 
 Gore Vidal is a national treasure and one of my favorite authors, but this is the most disappointing of his novels that I have read. The first hundred pages or so consist of Washington cocktail-party chatter circa 1940, and it doesn't get much better as it goes along. The characters seem oddly detached from the epochal events unfolding around them, and as a result the reader cares little about them. There is much to be said about the machinations of the ruling powers during the period covered in this book; perhaps a work of fiction, although based on fact, is not the proper forum to explore them, as master essayist Vidal must himself have known before finishing this dramatically unsatisfying work. Perhaps he needed the advance to pay the mortgage on his Italian villa? Authors have to eat, too 
 I agree with the comment below.  Boring.  I also have read all the books in the series and look forward to each new one.   This one was not up to the standard I expected with the In Death Series. By the end of the first chapter you knew the killer and why.  The conflict with Mira didn't fit either. Maybe the next one will be better 
 I got nothing but mad love and respect for the outlaws but they have def lost a step since pac's death. I think tupac must have wrote there rhymes cause they def do not have any skills. The cd also lacks production! The beats are terrible. The outlawz worldwide cd was also a huge waste! 
 This is a shorter, much simplified version of the original story that was published by Pantheon books in 1983.  I'm not sure what the point was in making a simplified version, since the complete story of Cornelius was my son's favorite when he was 3 years old.  I'd skip this version and go with the original 
 The transaction went fine. The product is comparatively far over priced. I was almost "drummed out" of an organization where I am the secretary, for spending that much on this item. We have a competitor's product for half the price, that rivals this Sony ICD-BM1 Recorder. Don't buy it!    
 I was reading the other reviews and wondered if I was reading the same book.  I even checked the cover to make sure.  Yep, I read the same book but didn't get the same information out of it than other people had.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if all of the other reviews were from Ryan Allis' mother, neighbors, and friends just to boost the book's credibility.  Here's the deal:  I've actually built and sold my company and didn't do it the way Ryan Allis suggested.  Not even close.  Okay, so maybe he has a different method, right?  I just don't see how it's possible to build a company the way he outlines, then to sell it?  I think that he's trying to cover way too much information in this book.  That's the first problem.  The second problem is this:  He tries to "fluff out" the book by adding extraneous information like "globalization" and why there was the "dot bomb crash" in the late 90s.  WHO CARES?  It's like he purposely adds useless information to either make himself seem more intelligent, confuse his readers, mask that he doesn't know what he's talking about or add pages to what would otherwise be a 50-page book.  Another issue I have is that he has his readers do an "opportunity recognition and evaluation" of a company that they would like to start.  Such companies he was able to "brainstorm" are making oxygen tanks so dogs and cats can go diving, flavored straws, sonar for blind people, a teddy bear with sensors and small computer inside that would talk to infants/toddlers and encourage good behavior or tell them a bedtime story (then what are parents for?), restaurants for dogs and cats and a variety of other SUPER LAME business ideas.  I have a lot of business experience under my belt and, if you are considering starting a business, here's my advice:  Don't reinvent the wheel.  Take a concept that someone else is doing very successfully, add your own twist to it, and your product or service through direct response (direct mail, Internet, etc.).  And that's it.  What's with the oxygen tanks for dogs and cats so they can go diving?  Is this guy out of his [CENSORED] mind?  I love my pets too much to subject them to something that would freak them out like underwater diving.  And doesn't he know that cats HATE THE WATER?  This is precisely why I like the book Multiple Streams of Income by Robert Allen so much.  He gives the BEST business ideas with actual step-by-step plans to go with it.  No guessing, reinventing the wheel, inventing some lame-brain product that is destined to fail, and pushing people in the wrong business direction.  If you are thinking of starting a business, don't buy this book.  If you have a business and would like to sell it, don't buy this book.  In fact, I can't think of ANY reason to buy this book 
 I give this book 2 stars for the occasional first person insights into the Doors. But there is too little of it. There is too much of the rantings of a man who is apparently trapped in the 6os, and is undergoing a personal mind battle between himself as a flower child and a business man. He often comes on as one or the other of these two conflicting images.  Often he rants about the establishment and their love of power and money, but at the same time he exudes great excitement when he describes the business and money aspect of his music career; like the big bucks he got when 'Light my Fire' hit the charts and the new car and beach house he was able to then buy. Or when he describes getting his first royalty check from Elektra and "Grinning and Dithering" while he makes his wife guess at the figure. Then she "squeals" and they hug and yell "We're rich!" A few pages later he goes on ranting about power and money hungry people.  I found too much hypocrisy in his writing like when he keeps using the phrase "I hope the lovers win the war. Don't you?" Then a few pages later he comes on as anything but a lover with his nasty second-hand gossip about Morrison allegedly telling him that he didn't like John Desmore. Uh, wouldn't a true lover and person who preaches peace and goodwill amongst each other, have kept that to himself rather than basically telling the world "Jim liked me more than John." I mean, what does that serve other than hurting another man's feelings? Nasty stuff from a self professed lover of people.  "Break On Through" is a much more supperior book on this topic. And it is a shame. Because with Manzarek's personal insight into the group, he could have provided the greatest story....But instead he chose to hog the spotlight and put too much of himself, his hypocritical pseudo hippy rantings, and his mean spirited jabs at others who were a part of this chapter in his life, into this book. I was hoping for more. Instead he delivered mostly junk 
 I've read reviews that this book is perfect for beginners and I'm at a loss to understand why.  Things are explained in high, low, fast, slow, and rarely gives an example of what specifically is meant.  The writer makes references to things that a beginning photographer, such as myself, might have the vaguest clue about without an explanation, or explanations that aren't very clear.  Bracketing is mentioned throughout the book but I'm still understand what the purpose is.  I expected clear explanations of the basics - composition, lighting, chosing a shutter speed, and choosing an aperture.  The book seems to cover each thing in little bits, then moves on.  There's approximately 40 pages (of large text) explaining everything from the different types of cameras, different types of flashes, compostition, lighting, metering, the different ways to meter (as well as the different devices), film, aperture and shutter speeds, and the many sub categories - I excluded all the pages of photographs, and much of the tip boxes since they don't really add much to what's already written on the page.  There was more information devoted to the different types of cameras then anything else.  I find the book to be almost completely useless.  It hardly expands on the manual that came with my camera 
 Obviously written for an American readership, this book is specious, shallow and facile. Revealing little understanding of the times or context in which Machiavelli's works were completed, it is suitable only for those seeking a bastardised view of Machiavelli's thought 
 When I first discovered the Stephanie Plum series (I started with Four to Score, then backtracked), I was delighted with the character of Stephanie Plum.  Although she was down on her luck, she was plucky, endearing, and canny enough to make the best of any situation she encountered.  In earlier books, Stephanie was kind to her family and friends even though they drove her crazy, held her own in her on again/off again relationship with boyfriend cop Joe Morelli, and walked a fine line during her curious encounters with Ranger.  She even showed some attitude with her smarmy cousin Vinnie, her ex-husband, and her nemesis Joyce Barnhardt.  But now, Stephanie Plum has morphed into someone who is selfish, stubborn and just plain stupid.  She has develped a childish mean streak and displays little regard for anyone but herself.    In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie is stalked by a gang hit man and, being the intrepid bounty hunter that she is, Stephanie walks right into the eye of the storm.  Deciding that Joe's concern for her safety is too oppressive, she moves out of his house and into Ranger's unoccupied apartment.  In one of her silliest schemes yet, she wrangles Lula and Connie into helping her kidnap a gang member, putting them all in jeopardy.  And as her sister's nuptuals approach, Stephanie becomes more and more obnoxious.  All this is played for laughs, but it misses the mark.  The plot is deja vu, the characters predictable.  Sadly, the loveable characters created long ago by Evanovich are now stuck in a time warp where they never grow up, never change and they go through similar events again and again.  Come on, bring back the old Stephanie and give Morelli something to do other than walk his dog Bob and answer his cell phone.  I'm taking a vacation from this series.  Bring on James Patterson, Laurie King, Lisa Gardner... 
 What is wrong with Artisan?  Finally releasing the final two "Prom Night" films on dvd that were previously issued under the IVE Home Video label should have been a good thing... but it went horribly wrong."Prom Night III: The Last Kiss" continues the storyline set up in 1987's "Hello Mary Lou: Prom Night II" in which a murdered Prom Queen has returned from the grave to wreak supernatural mayhem.  More of a parody than horror, the film offers up some rather inventive ideas, even if its ending is weak."Prom Night IV" takes the series in yet another direction as a demented preacher ruins Prom Night for a group of four friends.  This movie has some moments of real suspense admid all of the nonsense, and the final twist is indeed memorable.But the problem lies not with the movies themselves, but with the horrible transfers.  They are full frame only, and look like they were taken directly from the old VHS copies.  "Prom Night III" is even edited from a television print.  Much like the god-awful "Fright Night II" release earlier this year, this double-pack is a great disppointment for those fans who were looking forward to these movies' DVD premiere 
 Even though the book does embody several hints on playing the piano, two stars are still generous. The book lacks coherency and is a mind-dulling read at best. Constant attempts at humor make for twitching and disgust. It is hard to stay focused and interested in this book, no matter how ambitious the pianist. There are other great books out there that demonstrate the piano beautifully and that have a much stronger appeal. My recommendation is to keep looking and don't stop here. 
 This is one of the most superficial and ridiculous books on Japan that I came across.  Though a Harvard scholar, Reischauer has such a flimsy grasp of modern Japan that it is simply and utterly appalling.  It is like he wants the Japanese to love him and so writes only about the nicest things that he can find, while ignoring anything untoward - or even baselessly asserting that all problems like the Yakuza (!) will simply disappear as the country "matures".  Well, if you've lived there and seen that there is much ugliness beneath the veneer of democracy and politness, this book will disgust you to no end.    Not recommended.  It is a pathetic performance and deeply disappointing 
 I pulled this book off the library shelf because the author's name is so close to Austen.  I was a bit skeptical because I knew she could never measure up, but this was even worse than I expected.    Darcy and Elizabeth would have never raised their kids to have such a lack of propriety.  We all know how proper Darcy was and Elizabeth was so disgusted by her younger sisters, at times, she never would have raised clones.  Also, Jane Austen never wrote anything sexual in her books and there was plenty of it in this one, not harlequin romance sexual, but sexual all the same.  It just doesn't ring true for a period piece like this one.  If you are a true Jane Austen fan, you won't enjoy this book; it just bothers the soul 
 While entertaining, I found several times that the story slowed down and got a little preachy about the politics of drug money. While probably true it distracted from the story by being repeated and heavy handed. I also found the timeline hard to believe. Maybe because I have lived in the area and understand the distances (and traffic) travelled in short periods of time. I am a big Elizabeth Lowell fan  (as well as Ann Maxwell) but this was not one of her better books 
 Oh dear. Such a touchy and turgid tirade. This book is like a block of butter thrown against a stone wall....no impact whatsoever. Almost as believeable, bombastic and boring as the Bible, God or No God is such a great non-issue these days. Dull, dull, dull. Go watch an Arnie S. movie instead 
 I guess I shouldn't be complaining because I was attempting to pass the macroeconomics CLEP exam with the AP cliff notes book.  The reason I was doing this is because I could not find a study guide for it.  So if you are looking for a CLEP study guide don't get this book, I did pass with a 54 and I needed a 50, but it was pure luck 
 I absolutely HATE some of the songs on this CD. They're either stupid, boring, or EXTREMELY boring. I doubt the original versions were as uninteresting as she makes them. On the other hand, Super Duper Love is a likeable, happy song, and a couple others are too... but they can't save the CD. 
 I watched this movie, seeing that it was a "shark" movie. But where's the shark?? The plot is these people are hostages. The shark is just there so us shark fanatics have a reason to see this awful movie. But I was watching going, "okay, they're in the water, where is the shark???" Even JAWS 3, (which sucked) has more sharks. If you like hoatage movies, see this. (on second thought, don't...) But if you like sharks, see something else 
  Do dogs understand language?  Do they have their own syntax and grammar?  Stanley Coren thinks so.  Or maybe, as with many of his other books, he's only pretending to believe what he says in order to pique people's interest and sell more copies...  The words we use in dog training are actually irrelevant.  Since I train dogs in Manhattan, I often find myself on an elevator with one or more dogs.  When the door closes I'll say, "What do we do on an elevator?" and they'll all sit.  This often charms and surprises the other elevator occupants who may say something like, "Look!  They understand every word you say!"    Not really.  I trained the dogs to do this by first saying "What do we do on an elevator?-we sit."  Once that pattern was established, the dogs were able to make the leap from "What do we do on an elevator?" to "Sit" quite easily.  In fact, I could have as easily trained them to do this by using nonsense words, gobbledygook, ridiculous sounds that have no meaning at all.  So it isn't my words or syntax the dogs are responding to, it's my intent, my body language, my tone of voice (all carrying emotional information), and a previously established pattern of behavior.    Stanley Coren should know this better than anyone since one of his dogs is deaf, yet still obeys him.  Why?  Because of his body language and a previously established pattern of behavior, not because the dog "understands" his words.  Coren would say that the dog understands his hand signals the same way the hearing-impaired understand sign language.  But looked at objectively it's far more likely that the dog's response to hand signals is still just part of a previously established pattern of behavior, not a linguistic or cognitive process.   Coren would still disagree.  He claims that certain vocalizations made by dogs can be grouped together, which he takes to mean that there's a kind of syntax or grammar at work.  I'm sorry, Stan, but real language doesn't operate on such a simplistic level.  And while it may seem brave and controversial of Coren (who has a degree in psychology, not linguisics or animal behavior) to disagree with Noam Chomsky about the nature of language, at this stage in the development of linguistic science that's a bit like a high school sophmore disagreeing with Sir Isaac Newton about gravity.    Look, it's fairly obvious to anyone who really understands dogs that the reason certain yips, barks, growls, etc. are sometimes used together and others aren't (which isn't always true, by the way -- it depends on the dog), is that each vocalization comes from an emotional, not a cognitive state.  In other words, certain emotions -- like fear and aggression -- may be felt by the animal simultaneously, while others -- calmness and fear -- can't be.  It's not grammar or syntax, it's emotion, pure and simple.    Even if Coren hadn't thought this through from an emotional point of view, if he'd spent any time at all studying comparative neuroanatomy he'd know that a dog's brain has no Broca's area, which makes linguistic ability totally impossible.  But as with other books he's written (his LEFT-HANDER SYNDROME was notorious for being based on false data), Coren doesn't seem to care much about the truth.    Still, I have to admit that it's hard not to buy into this myth because as human beings we're constantly explaining our feelings and experiences to ourselves through our thoughts and inner monologues, or to others through conversations, letters, etc.  As a result we're almost forced, by the way our brains work, to supply a similar linguistic medium for a dog's feelings and behaviors when no such medium or ability exists.    I trained my dog to respond in a certain way whenever I ask him a certain question.  And I have to admit, I like the way it feels when I say to him, "Do you love me?" and he wags his tail, comes over, puts his paws on my chest, and licks my nose.  Does he understand the meaning of that sentence when I say it to him?  Of course not.  But I know he understands the emotion.  It's a shame that Coren doesn't get this fundamental difference between real linguistic understanding and pure emotion, particularly when the misinformation he disseminates in this book can be detrimental to the relationship between you and your dog, a relationship that SHOULD be based on real and, quite often, wonderful emotions, not on any imaginary ability to use and understand language.    If I could I'd give this book no stars at all 
 when i first bought these dvd's i thought it had all the jackass Skits, but it didn't. It doesn't even have the best skits such as the Heavy Metal alam clock,Knoxville walking around in a fake boner,the Corn sled, etc. I have to admit, there where some good scenes in it such as the Lawn trap and the Snake river bmx. Don't waste your money on these dvds, you would be beter off taping the jackass episodes off mtv 
 I realize that the Stephanie Plum series is primarily written for women and I can appreciate that. Even though I am a guy I had really enjoyed the books until this one. First of all, I grew very tired of all the misadventures. I know that is the charm of her character but I think she averaged 3 strange encounters a day. It just wasn't very realistic. Also, the ending was terrible. If Ranger was going to take care of her business anyway, why did he let her waste all that time? Lastly, is there going to be a point when Stephanie actually becomes semi-independent and competent. I am starting to lose the love for Ms. Plum 
 This video is painfully boring and would not challenge even the newest beginner to exercise. To much boring blather between each series of exercises. Explains at length very simple moves yet demonstrates poor (some time dangerous) form and bad habits. If you are looking for a quick and efficient workout - or worse, a challenging one - run, don't walk, away from this one. I wish I could get my money back 
 The glimpses into cop work are brief, over-dramatized, and lacking the emotional power of other works by authors such as Gina Gallo.  It is a sincere attempt to reveal the inner workings of NYPD but the author fails to achieve this.  I found myself losing interest after chapter 2, which is a shame, because the subject is an ever-engrossing one 
 This is the first movie review I have ever written.  I wish I could have been doing something more pleasurable than watching this epic...like poking myself in the eye with an ice pick or lighting myself on fire.  Wait, it gets worse...I actually bought this piece of camel dung..  ..  I am going to loan it to a prick at work that I hate!  No, I'll give it to him and refuse to take it back...  Hurry, go see it! 
 The 1947 Nobel Laureate in literature Andre Gide (1869-1951) wrote this short story in 1919. It is considered to be a lyrical prelude to his major novel "the Counterfeiters", published seven years later. This story is similar to "the Counterfeiters" in a way that it explores the falsehood that exists in the relationships between people.  The story tells about a rural pastor, who adopts, out of mercy, an orphaned girl, whose condition is further aggravated by the fact that prior to becoming an orphan, she had been living with an elderly and somewhat deaf aunt; therefore, she is not adept in understanding the language that people speak and the connection that exists between words and perceptions. The pastor undertakes the responsibility of educating the blind girl - her name is Gertrude - in accordance with the methods that are used to educate the blind. At the same time, the relationships within the pastor's family grow complex ...   This story is a rebellion against rigours of religious postulates. At one time it enjoyed a great popularity in author's native France and in 1946 its screen version was released. However, the likelihood that the story, the way it is described, could take place indeed is somewhat low. Not only the believability of the plot line is questionable, the emotions seem to be overdramatised. "The Counterfeiters" does not share these drawbacks, though 
 I've always loved Kay Thompson's brilliant "Eloise" books.  Eloise was born 3 years before me, although she benefits from a case of arrested development (not unlike Dennis the Menace), having reached the age of 6 in 1955 and never aging since. I've been to the Plaza Hotel as a child in the late '50s and early '60s, and my mother spent many happy years in the Big Apple, some as a Barbizon resident.    My grandmother once remarked to my mother that the oil portrait of Eloise in the Plaza lobby made her think "She must be the manager's daughter," since no other explanation could account for such an "ugly child" being so prominently displayed!  Kay Thompson was a graduate of the same high school in St. Louis as my mother, and went on to achieve many wonderful, gutsy, triumphs in Hollywood as a dancer, choreographer, designer, and actress (including her role in "Funny Face" with Fred Astaire and Audrey Hebburn as the Vogue-ish magazine editor who advocated "Think pink!").  I greatly admire the multi-talented and mercurial Thompson and her  inspired illustrator, Hilary Knight who did as much as Thompson to bring Eloise to life.  For that matter, I very much like Eloise herself, who was by all accounts Kay Thompson's alter-ego.  The first Eloise book was subtitled "A book for precocious grownups, about a little girl who lives at the Plaza Hotel."  Eloise was a child, but the books were not meant for children. Adults, especially those who've raised children of their own, understand that children are not Better, Wiser, Smarter, and Kinder than adults. But since at least "Pollyanna" if not before, Disney Studios has been churning out a constant stream of propaganda films asserting just the opoosite.  And now, Kay Thompson's wonderful playful, innocent, bratty, obnoxious, sweet Eloise has been beatified by Disney as their latest Child Sage.  The problem with these lies (and all others) is that they blind people of all ages to their own shortcomings while unfairly blaming them on others.  Children are not wiser and better than adults, and they never have been, and they never will be, even if Jimmy Carter did think his 11-year-old daughter Amy had the last word to say about nuclear weapons (he was mistaken, of course).  Children are typically much more cruel than adults, and if they say sweet innocent things from time to time (which is rare) it is only because they haven't lived long enough to learn better.    But they will learn better eventually; although some of them will suppress or deny their life-lessons to become seriously committed adult hypocrites.  Adults who don't get this either don't have children, or don't pay attention to them as they really are, Disney Studios' party line notwithstanding.    In the books, Eloise's charm lay in her vulnerabiltity, her precociousness, her smart-aleck attitude, and her essential warmth, which asked no quarter and took no prisoners...delightful as childish qualities, but lacking in, shall we say...nuance.  Disney tries to make her into an all-wise marriage counselor and social activist do-gooder. As such, Eloise is transformed from a delightful child into a *very adult* sociopathically manipulative prig, which quite ruins the film...as it also ruins real life when people go wrong like that.  This was never the character Thompson and Knight developed, who was simply a charming self-absorbed brat...and, by the way, a lot more credible as an actual child.  Eloise's future as an adult has been speculated upon. Some think her a likely candidate for alcholism, drug addiction, and perhaps certain dysfunctional sexual disorders, as an adult child of an absentee mother and no father at all, raised in circumstances of artificial material luxury and moral decadence.   Such concerns are not unfocused, but since we all know that Eloise will never, and can never, get any older than 6 years of age, they are, I would suggest, unwarranted.    Meanwhile, I wish Disney Studios would either go away or do something else.  Of course "children of all ages" (sanctimonious children and smug, narcissistic adults who can't or won't grow up) will eat this junk up as Disney knows very well.    But I think Kay Thompson would spin in her grave at this PC propagandistic re-working of her own special "inner child" who was so much more real than this Disney caricacture: not despite, but because of, her obvious childish failings.  On the plus side, the film's production values could not be better, and the little girl who plays Eloise is...perfect.  Julie Andrews is absolutely wonderful as Nanny.  The sets are great.  I loved the first half hour of this film, before the Disney message (children, especially little girls, are the Master Race) became apparent.  It's certainly well done!  I did wonder, since there seemed to be an emphasis on making the time frame seem 1950s-like, why the featured toy store was Toys R Us instead of New York's flagship toy store, F.A.O. Schwartz?  
 I really wanted to like this novel.  It had a clever name, an amalgamation of the Great Schism that separate Catholicism and Protestantism, and Matrix, like the movie with the same title.  (Note: the novel is pronounced Shiz-mat-rix, with a short a, rhymes with schematics).  A classic cyberpunk title.  However, this novel is anything but user-friendly.  I don't know if pharmaceuticals are needed for appreciating this novel, or if the author used them when frantically writing, in between vacuuming the roof of his house and such.  The novel moves at such a frantic pace that within one sentence the entire setting can change and this happens more than a few times.  It's difficult to know the point of the plot; perhaps that life is worth living.  The novel is a cross between Heinlein's Time Enough For Love, Bester's The Stars My Destination, and petting a sea urchin.  In a shocking act of consideration, the publishers have included all of Sterling stories related to the Shaper-Mechanist War.  That would be the full length novel, plus five stories.  The stories were written before the novel, which was the order I read them in, although after reading the novel last, I can't say whether or not to recommend reading in that order.  The stories are interesting and enjoyable.  In fact Sterling seems to excel with his short stories.  His story "Flowers of Edo" is where I got interested in his style.  I would recommend his short stories, but this novel is another matter.  Humanity has balkanized into a number of factions, with the Shapers and Mechanists being the most powerful.  The Shapers have reshaped their bodies genetically.  This includes such drastic things as replacing all the E. Coli in their intestines with enzymes.  The Mechanists are like the Borg of Star Trek, they use mechanical prosthetics to enhance themselves.  If you think the Mechanists are the cleaner of the two, think again.  Cockroaches and bacteria are prevalent in Mechanist environments.  Every five years the Mechanists need to have the bacterial growth scraped and UV-burned off their skin.  That's one thing prevalent throughout his writings, this sort of creepiness.  Expect more of it.  However, don't let the war make you think this is some majestic good vs. evil epic space war.  Battles are mostly low key.  There is lot's of narration and dialog.  Sterling self-claims his crammed prose.  No kidding.  Adjectives rule supreme in this novel; as many as possible are crammed into each sentence.  If one would do a histogram of adjectives, this novel would be on the far right tail of the bell curve.  Here's an excerpt: " He always wore his spacesuit, [something something], and [multiple length modifiers] body odor came through its [multiple adjectives] collar with [multiple adjectives] pungency."  Sentences like this go on and on and on and on and on and on and on throughout the novel.  And there's no shortage of hyphenated words, like long-fermented, eye-watering.  On one page, there were no less than 11 hyphenated words, plus one triple one.  Similar to the prosthetics of the Borg, the sentences themselves seem interchangeable.  Here's another excerpt of a dialogue: "What was your brigade? I'm no Cataclyst. I have your weapon here. Constantine pulled a ... vial from his ... jacket ..." You may as well interchange your own sentences: `The tree fell in the forest; it made no sound' or `the space ship went into orbit; it's boots were muddy.'  Give it a try. It'll make as much sense.  There are times when the novel seems profound.  I would find myself backtracking at times to understand some point, and I would go back 5, then 10, then 20 pages to try to understand something and would just give up and go back to where I was.  It's hard to say you read this novel, it's more like your eyes glance over the words, and on occasion you absorb some of it.  Since the novel fluctuates from the profound to the mundane an average of 2-1/2 stars seemed appropriate 
 If your body has no problems with insulin insenstitivity and you have terrific will power, then maybe this plan is right for you. but i whole heartedly disagree with his claims that certain foods with high fat content are unhealthy. ie nuts, avocados, fish oil, even butter (gasp!) he also says that eating meat in excess will cause it to rot in your intestines causing your skin and breath to smell! I've never heard of this phenomenon, I refuse to believe it, and physiologically it doesn't make sense. the only reason I gave this book one star is because of his advocation to "whole foods" which are unprocessed. contrary to what one "anti ornish" reviewer said, it's in my opinion that a huge part of the obviously unhealthy average american diet lies in the fact that heavily processed foods are bombarded with partially hydrogenated oils and preservatives. Many people in Europe eat daily by riding their bike to a local market, and preparing food that would otherwise spoil in a day or two. AND THAT IS A GOOD THING! the less a food is injected with man made hormones and chemical preservatives, the better off you are eating it. Long story short, if your protein needs aren't large and you don't have an insulin sensitivity problem, then you may lose fat  and become a bit healthier on this diet. otherwise, just make an effort to eat foods in moderation. it's as simple as that! cut out as much sugar and trans fats as possible. (no one ever needs those and in my opinion they aren't hard to live without.)and don't eat any more than you need to, to reach satiety 
 I LOVE the series. Have read every book. I am disappointed that they started out in paperback and when it became popular they switched to Hardcover. Tacky in my opinion. But anyhow. I love EVE, Roarke and all of them. In my opinion this one is lame and boring. I actually felt that I eithe wanted to skip pages ( but you never can because right then and there you might miss something ) or just was very eager to read about anything the friends and buttler had to offer. It was okay to find out about another piece of Eve's past. But she goes on and on and on... and yes it is important, and in every book it is mentioned, this time it was written in a very lame and boring style. Very sad. The entire story had no umpf to it. It is as if Nora Roberts wrote it with half her brain already dreaming of her next vacation or she was bored with this as well and couldn't quite get it right. That happens. Doesn't make it bad or the series bad. I LOVE it. But this one, what a drag it was. Blah. I could tell from the beginnig who it was. Now we just had to wait and find out the details that usually EVe puzzles together. It was as Eve was just tired. And the story just didn't move on. No umpf and fire behind it. Just listing of situations, ideas and people's problems. Boring. I recommend this series to anyone interested, but of course hope you will start with the first one. To fully understand the relationship between all of them. And why now do we have to be cross with Mira? It not just sad but stupid as well. Doesn't fit. Never got the point in the last book, why it ticked EVe off so much. So her friend had a bit of a hard time accepting that this icone of hers wasn't all he seemed. Not as if Eve never had her moments of meltdown. Yes she always did her job right but so did Mira, she delivered in the end. I love the relatinoship between Mira and Eve and really didn't need to read that they were not doing well together. And the make up was, okay but not thrilling.  Okay. Enjoy this book, I am sure it will thrill many but for me it was a boring book.  
 is this guy putting us on? all his albums sound the same and the reviews do as well-if your not hip enough or intellectual enough than you can't understand this deep moving experience. stick to music you enjoy, not what your supposed to "understand"-this music is for the few people recording it, not those who want music than can experience and feel something from 
 I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't.  This book is mediocre at best.  I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did.  I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim.  I doubt I will ever meet a "Wim" in real life!).  My favorite Danielle Steel novels are "The Gift" and "Safe Harbour".  I empathized with those characters more and was moved by those stories.  If you like books with more depth and substance, give those a try 
 The authors brief treatment of what are very complex topics will lead readers to falsely believe that they can trade these markets with little training. It appears that the authors basically cut and pasted brief paragraphs about a variet of topics and called it a book. Other reviewers have called it a 'big picture' book, the truth is it is a complete waste of time and money. 
 I was dissapointed with this book, because it was exactly what I was trying to avoid.  Clement falls into the same trap as so many other authors - they tell you when to meditate, why to meditate, who meditates - but never gives a good explanation on HOW to meditate.  She never quite gets to the meat and potatoes of meditation.  This is a good book to read if you've never heard of meditation - not one article, not one example of the experience - an absolute beginner.  Otherwise, throw this junk aside.  There are better, more complete guides available (such as "The Best Guide to Meditation" by Victor Davich) 
 ...not a musician.  What I see in the negative reviews is a desire for Rod the Musician to return to old form. What I detect in the positive reviews is an enjoyment of Rod as an entertainer. Some people value musical chops and creativity- others simply want to be nostalgic and entertained. Rod converted long ago from  musician to Vegas entertainer.  If you want a taste of some old rockers who remain creative musicians, sample Robert Plant's or Neil Young's latest. Don't waste your time on Rod or this kitsch 
 After reading this book and reading most of the posts, I can say that the ones who disagree with S. Hannity stole my thoughts. S. Hannity is good at yelling at guests on his tv show but nothing else. He never offers a thoughtful opinion and he argues with the stomach and never uses his brain. If you like controversy then buy Bill O'reilly and Michelle Malkin's books at least those two try their best to get their points across. Hannity's book is a waste of many even though it's only 5 dollars (you can buy two Mcdonald chicken sandwiches for that price).  
 It sounded like a remix sung by someone else, not at all like the original.  My husband and I were very disappointed and because of it I haven't even opened the other CDs by KC & the Sunshine Band that I ordered.  Don't order this product 
 If you're considering buying the Peter Smith "edition" of this book, note that it is NOT a new "edition" in hardcover but the Vintage International edition rebound in red cloth, with the cover of said trade paperback glued onto the front. It looks like it's been rebound for libraries, is the type of thing that's usually not for sale to the general public (. . .) The book is WELL-REBOUND, and may still be worth it to you Cormac McCarthy diehards out there -- it is for me, and ultimately I'm just gonna keep the copy of it I bought, but it's still quite disappointing. Thought you deserved a warning, hope it came in time. McCarthy's a great writer, of course -- feel a little guilty about the one-star, but it's an issue of the edition, not the book 
 Daniel B. Clendenin's EASTERN ORTHODOXY CHRISTIAN: A Western Perspective seeks to introduce the history and theology of this little-known branch of Christianity to Protestants. An evangelical Protestant, Clendenin became acquainted with Eastern Orthodoxy while teaching at Moscow State University. He is convinced that Protestants and Orthodox have much to learn from each other, and that Protestants should approach the East with a "hermeneutic of love".  The work is divided into seven sections. The first is a general introduction and the second a brief history. The next four sections each deal with an aspect of Orthodox theology unfamiliar or confusing to Protestants. These are the emphasis on apophatic revelation, the use of icons, the relationship of Scripture and Tradition, and theosis. In the final section Clendenin critiques Orthodoxy from his Protestant perspective--dealing frankly with the frequency of nationalism and even racism in Orthodox churches--but nonetheless trying to appreciate its many fine qualities. Clendenin does not have the space to go into much depth on any of these topics, however.  I was not too impressed by the book. Much of the work is repetitive, and in a volume of only 180 pages such repetition makes the work very insubstantial indeed. Clendenin also makes several errors which caused me to doubt his familiarity with the history of the Church. He writes, for example, that the Slavs were converted in 988, when this marked only the conversion of Kyiv Rus and most Slavs were already evangelised over a century earlier. His focus is entirely on the church in Russia and Greece/Byzantium and the contributions of other regions are ignored. The work is written in a journalistic style with frequent resorts to quotations and a great deal of footnotes, suggesting that the author is not terribly specialised in the subject at hand.  For Westerners curious about Orthodoxy, I think there is no better introduction than Kallistos Ware's THE ORTHODOX CHURCH, an instant classic when it was first published over forty years ago, and available in a relatively new updated edition. Clendenin's work is admirable for its attempt to build dialogue between Protestants and Orthodox, but his work is really too short 
 Angus Macfadyen actually did a *great* job with this movie; he was the only redeeming factor in this film.  I thought it kind of funny as the movie progressed, the more muscle tee-shirts he wore. He appeared as a sea-jock more than a pirate. Problem is people back then didn't wear muscle-tees and were completely covered as much as possible. I don't know how they could stand it, but they did.   TOO BAD Hallmark only *vaguely*--and I do emphasize vaguely--did a biography on this legendary pirate. TOO BAD! Shame on you scripwriters!! Never one mention of Blackbeard's childhood, being raised by parents from holle who constantly beat him up, and sent him to a school that routinely beat their students, which made him run away. Maybe this in itself would have let people understood why Blackbeard turned out the way he did.  I have no idea where they came up with this Captain Kidd's treasure. He just liked to rob ships.   Also, interesting to note, the real Blackbeard had approximately 14 wives and numerous groupies. He must have had some real interesting sex parties.. He apparently was a sex symbol of the seas being such a bad bad boy :-)  I think if the writers were not so busy fictionalizing Blackbeard and stuck with the genuine one as much as possible this film would have been a smash hit. They did the real Blackbeard a terrible injustice.  
 Queen Victoria almost certainly would have been amused if she had thought to pick up a copy of Edwin Abbott's inventive story "Flatland" when it was first published in 1884. But it's unlikely that she would be amused at the degree to which Pickover has chosen to rehash all of the same ideas - and, not just once, but seeking to dress the same material up as different chapters over and over again. My goodness, there are only so many ways that one can say a three dimensional sphere projects as a circle in two dimensions. Therefore, a four dimensional hypershpere projects into three dimensions as a sphere. OK, OK - I got it the first time!  It's bad enough that Surfing Through Hyperspace barely rises above plagiarism. But Pickover has tried to tart the presentation up with a bizarre, pretentious narration that is also a simple rip off from Scully and Mulder of X-Files fame! This silly repetitious presentation borders on insulting to any intelligent reader who, after reading a couple or three chapters, will realize they would have been better off going to the store to buy the original item - Flatland.  Any other material that is beyond Flatland - wormholes, Many Worlds Theory, quantum mechanics and superluminal contact, to name a few examples - are explained more completely and more clearly in any number of other sources. I did briefly get excited when one chapter headed down a road that looked really promising - multidimensional variations on games like chess and monopoly; knights that weren't allowed to effectively jump into the 3rd dimension by leaping over men on the board; 3-D chess play inside an 8x8 cube; a chess board on a Mbius strip. Then Pickover pulled the ultimate cop out - "We leave exploration of these interesting variations as an exercise to the reader." For crying out loud, if I was a mathematician, a physicist or a game theorist, somehow I doubt I would have purchased the book in the first place!  Surfing Through Hyperspace promised a deeper understanding of higher dimensions but, for me, it was a profound disappointment. 
 Let me say right off the bat, I am a skeptic, but still I loved author Gary Goldschneider's first two books from this series: the Secret Language of Birthdays and the SL of Relationships.  But this one, THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY is a bore.  Rather than offering two pages to each birth date, as Birthdays did, or a half of a page as Relationship did, this book gives the reader a short 1/4 page paragraph that allegedly sums up the destiny of those born in each of the 48 personology periods. This information is so general and by the way so boring that it could relate to anyone if in fact you don't fall asleep reading it.  For this reason, I do not recommend THE SECRET LANGUAGE OF DESTINY.   -- Regina McMenami 
 As a subscriber to a service that Mike Coval writes for that I enjoy, I had high hopes for a full length book written by him. Unfortunately, this book really sucks and the money I spent to buy it would have been better spent on just about anything else. Period. There is NOTHING of value here. By about page 10, I was fully convinced that I had been had, and realized all too late that this was just a poor excuse for a book.  Please don't buy this - Buy the Josh Lukeman book, or any Alexander Elder book, or even a Cramer book. This thing stinks to high heaven 
 David Schiller may think that there are a million ways to God but God sais there is only one. I wonder what the use of Jesus sacrifice was if one can enter heaven through Allah or Buddah. None.And that is because there is no other way to eternal life exept through Jesus Christ. This book can only lead a person away from the truth and into deception. Jesus died to take our sins away so that we can come clean before God and so that when God sees us He will see Jesus in us, thus giving us the right to enter heaven without blemish. Believe in Jesus and you shall be saved. God bless you 
 Though the title sells the book as the sexiest thing in Latin women writers and readers yet, the reality is that they fall very short of meeting expectations. Being Latina myself and in the United States, and even if I do get to identify with some of the themes and stories in some of the essays.. please, what a yawn. We are all depicted as martyrs, huge success stories in comparison to our parents and generations before us, and/or unable to speak English without saying one Spanish word every three sentences. I want to think that we have much more of an edge, much more of a sense of humor, (much better writing skills!) and much more of a story to tell others. "Latinas dish on sex, sass, and cultural shifting"? That must be in the second book, because this one is nothing but a flat collection of high school essays. Nice attempt though 
 This book is awful.  The blurb makes it sound like a story of ostracism in high school, but the characters are cardboard-flat. It's more of a preachy spiritual trip for the author than a story.  There's no reason for the narrator, Justin, to befriend the school outcast (who is a Christian-raised white boy trying to live as a Buddhist monk). The narrator's friends are bratty and too obviously shallow. The school bully is a stock stereotype who does all the predictable bully things. I got about halfway through and quit. 
 Ms. Brightman is clearly intelligent and well organized. However, the goal of the book often appears to steer the writer to make this very observation. There is quite a whiff of ego in this work. While I did read  the political sections out of a vague guilt or distant interest, I found  them to be particularly self-indulgent. I knew I was in trouble when she  quotes Robert Hunter leading her to examine "Ship of Fools," and  she has to check sources for the words. Not a good sign, although perhaps  this distance allows a decent critical eye instead of the heavy syrup often  attributed to Dead books. Still, every few pages I get a vision of the  author jumping from the page, saying "Look at me!" This book is  worth reading, chiefly because Mr. Garcia is an endlessly fascinating  character, but you will not read it twice. Go for the paperback.. 
 This book is horrible and chocked full of slanted thinking (?) and outrght lies aimed at dividing this country even further. It's a sad, sad day when this is what American politics have become 
 Personally none too impressed with this effort. Tom Miller obviously has the ability to create 3D games, but his attempt at allowing the book buying public the chance to learn some of his skills didn't help me a bit!  Explanations were introduced at a far higher level than I would have liked, and the learning curve seemed to go from 0-200 mph within around 5-6 pages.  Examples didn't work, and I actually had to scour the internet for solutions from other readers, in order to progress with the book!....  Save your money!!!!! 
 After reading all these 5 star reviews i wondered whether i read the same book. Although this isn't a reading book at all. Maybe it's more suited to typographers or font design, but i found it to be page after page of much the same stuff. Don't get me wrong, i think he has a unique and dramatic design style, but after a few pages it all gets a bit boring. If you're looking for inspiration for graphic or web design, look somewhere else 
 I didn't really enjoy this book.  First, there were ... errors in it.  Michael did not heal Liz.  Anyone writing a book about Roswell should know that.  Also, I didn't like the interaction between Liz and Tess.  Yes, I am not a Tess fan, but I didn't like how she walked on Liz at all.  It wasn't how it happened in the show, and that really bothered me.  As for storyline, the book was pretty good.  If you've never seen the show, you will probably like it.  If you're a die hard fan of the show, and little mistakes drive you insane, or if you aren't a big fan of Tess, this probably isn't the book for you 
 This clock gains about 5 minutes every 4 days or so.  I have an old digital plug-in clock that keeps perfect time, but the alarm doesn't work.  I bought this one for the alarm, but usually have to reset the time to match the old plug-in about twice a week.  Also, if it gets dropped or knocked off the table, you have to reset the time.  I've had 2 or 3 other clocks of this type that keep perfect time, maybe gain a minute or two every 6 months.  I would not buy another Timex.  
 "Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons" was not condensed, but was merely the play reworded.  Granted that it did help decipher hidden meanings behind some of the dialogue, or certain innuendo's which can go over one's head, but other than that, it was not helpful or insightful.  I think it actually took me longer to read the Spark Notes, than the actual play itself.  If you do get this book, of course you know to read "Spark Notes A Man For All Seasons" AFTER you have read "A Man For All Seasons: A Play in Two Acts."  I do not recommend 
 I agree with a previous reviewer who found fault with the way the story was told.  There is no excitement in describing the stages.  They are just wrapped up all of a sudden.  To me, it did not seem like the author did many interviews of his own.  It seems like he just watched the Tour de France and retold what he saw on the broadcast.  His supposed "back-stories" which should be really interesting, all seem like a recap of the mini segments during the Tour broadcast that let you know more about the participants.  There is just nothing that reaches out and grabs you, and makes you want to keep reading.  I finally quit it after the poor description of the day in the Pyrenees.  That is one of the most exciting stages of the race, and the narrative was so wooden 
 I ordered this item fully understanding that it was a beginner's sewing machine. I know it's not the heavy duty kind with bells and whistles that costs a pretty penny. So when I tested the machine on the test material that comes with it I wasn't expecting it to be the only stitches I would get out the machine. When I lifted the foot and took the sample material out and placed my material in (cotton, not a heavy material) it didn't work. I checked the plug, nothing. It simply stopped working. I sent it back in about a month ago and just got it back today. It works now, but not a highly recommended product 
 This is a show-biz "memoir" of the most terrifying kind ... badly written and leaving readers with two questions: "Why did she write it?" and "Why did I read it?" Hemingway uses the practices and lessons of yoga as a way of telling of her tales --- which, if you believe the hype, "is a searing honest memoir that is firmly practical." That's "firmly" as in the way Hemingway discusses her [breast] job, going so far to admit that whenever she met a friend, she'd lift up her shirt to give the bosom buddy a peek at her "prizes." Her chapter on the death of sis Margaux is an insult and embarrassment, shrouded in new-age babble such as "I gradually began to let go of Margaux's karma, realizing that her pain and problems were hers and not mine." And you wonder why Mariel has no career left 
 My subscription was for a year. But the subscription office stopped sending the magazines even before the subscription expired. I would suggest people subscribe to Good Housekeeping directly instead 
 What happened?  Instead of continuing on with this fantastic series, the animators decided to use one whole DVD volume to recap all events up to this point.  Did someone in the production team realize that the series was going to be one DVD short in filling up the box set & they decided to remedy that?  Get Vol. 4 ONLY if you have short term memory issues or like looooooooong flashbacks.  Otherwise skip to Volume 5, you'll be glad you did 
 Having enjoyed LOST IN TRANSLATION, I thought I might like this one, which seems to have some sort of cult reputation-- why I can't fathom. The entire plot is self-serving, shallow, and unrealistic. I guess it's supposed to depict the horror of repressive religious values, and while I don't condone those, the film lacks clear characters or any motivation. A lot of people have buttoned up parents who don't get it, and it doesn't mean they kill themselves-- because they were grounded!?  Since the writer-director gerw up in Hollywood, she may not be aware that you can't keep your kid home from school without a very good reason-- social workers and what not come after you. So the entire premise is false.  Romanticizing mass suicide by having a bunch of soft focus young blondes do it-- after which they supposedly ascend to erotic eternity in the imaginations of their boyish peers-- could actually encourage the act. It's not caring, not real, and not responsible.  But I guess that wouldn't bother the rich, overfunded daughter of a Hollywood genius out to make a name for herself. 
 Teena Marie - Sapphire (Cash Money Classics, 2006)  I picked up Teena Marie's latest album, Sapphire, the other day. As I listened to it, I started to think very fondly about "A Rose By Any Other Name" (featuring Gerald Levert), "I'm So In Love", "Black Rain", and "I'm on Fire". Those songs are, however, from her last album, La Doï¿½a. When you listen to an artist's current album and can't stop thinking about how good her last one was, there's a problem.  It's not that any of these songs are bad, or that she's trying too hard to be cool (we're already used to veterans trying to fit into today's urban landscape). It's just that most of this album is dull and boring. A lot of the songs are about love and sex; even her last album was more varied in theme. Also, the musical arrangements leave a lot to be desired. The good songs to me have to be the very first one ("God Has Created" with Smokey Robinson) and the very last one ("Resilient [Sapphire]" with her daughter, Alia Rose).   What's between those are 70 minutes of filler with the exception of "You Blow Me Away". And for "Baby Who's Is It"  ("who's" should be spelled "whose", by the way), it is unnecessary for Kurupt and Teena to rap and sing (respectively) the same lyrics together. One or the other would have been fine. Furthermore, I don't really wanna hear about Teena smoking spliffs on a reggae-lite jam ("Simmer Down"). And what's the deal with "Somebody Just Like You" ending with her saying, "Are you ever gonna get a job?" It doesn't even go with what she was talking about.  This review may be unpopular but I just wasn't feeling this album. Call me an old head but I think I'll go back to listening to La Doï¿½a or even better, her older, early '80s stuff. -EJ 
 This is a nice bag with a fatal flaw.  The major zippers break very easily.  After my first bag broke within a few months, Amazon kindly provided a free replacement.  Deja vu ensued.  For a few extra dollars, Delta could use more robust zippers--they really should.  
 If you are a man, you will not like this collection of feminist essays.  This book is worse than bad.  It is an abomination 
 Maybe I'm just too young, but I became frustrated with the references to obscure songs from the roaring 20's. Most of the lyrical references in this book are before 1950. Surely there are some modern songs containing good lyrics, right? The book reads like a reference book, and is quite preachy. Not a joy to read. I suggest "88 Songwriting Wrongs, and How to Right Them". 
 I read this book after reading all the glowing reviews here and couldn't believe how much I hated it. It was long and dull,  repetitive and predictable, and it went NOWHERE. It was depressing and not in the way that I like. I actually hated the characters and felt a sort of repulsed pity for them...Their upbringing is NO excuse, either. There are millions of people who had similar backgrounds to this and still managed to become intelligent, sensitive people who are aware of the world around them and have many interests other than sex and drugs. To be fair, the story and characters do contain an unfortunate realism but...I sure don't want to spend my time reading about them. The narrative however flows nicely, the author's very talented.. 
 Look, I'm generally not too keen on writing up internet reviews on big ol' sellin' sites like this one. BUT, listen, all of you:  Don't get this book.  It was, in a word, GOD AWFUL. Wait, that was two.   50% of it are useless lectures of non-existent subjects and pecuilar scenarios given that all of it is predictions of what happens 60 years in the future -- which you're living right now. Some ideas are a little interesting, but fall flat because of poor dialogue and needless exaggerations.   25% of the book is a love story. Well, it tries to be, until it just goes zany at the end, with one of the most screwed up twists at the end.  And, the other 25%? Just other stuff saying how this is Heinlein's long lost first novel and how you should value this.  Haha. No.  Really, if you've never read Heinlein, DON'T START HERE. Only read this if it's free, you have a huge craze with Heinlein, you've LOVED every one of his books, AND you don't mind being given lectures much more boring, garaunteed, than your 12th grade Calculus teacher.  It's evil, and it should die. Or, it should have never been published. Something like that.  Ugh 
 I found the main character annoying and unbelivable, as she appears much too clever.  Maybe if she solved her crimes completely by accident it would be believable, but outsmart the police?  It is also somewhat offensive to make fun of the things she does--the senility and forgetfulness in old age, joking and laughing about death and funerals.  The sense of humor is an attempt at being silly but it is offensive.  Living in this kind of environment where one is losing friends and family to death, the loneliness and sadness found there, is a topic and setting of bad taste.  My guess is the author herself does not live under such circumstances, but when she does, maybe she won't make jokes about it anymore.  Just another example of how people in our society take lightly and joke about things that should be taken seriously 
 Is Ms. London a native speaker of English?  If so, her editor should clue her in on the use of colloquial language.  Some of the dialogue between Leah and Michael is so stilted as to not be believed, viz., "I do not think I can do this."  "I am sure that you can."  Et cetera.  Real people just don't talk like that.  And how many times can a reader take watching the silly break-ups between two supposedly adult people? Sorry to be so negative, but this author needs to take a creative writing course or something.  I think I'll pass on any of her other titles 
 Trash all the way.  The writers not only insult their characters but also readers who may find themselves and their style/taste looked down upon in the most offensive way.  Any book that insults and alienates it's readers in such way deserves one star, but the book also comes short in plot, character development and dialog.  Don't waste your money and time, if you must read chick-lit, you'll do much better with your money if you buy the B. Jones' Diary or the shopoholic series 
 Based upon the very good reviews, I was expecting something better. Someone said on "Lover Awakened" forum that it was a very good read, while waiting for J.R. Ward to produce her next opus. Very similar writing ... Alas, I could not find anything similar ... I found the book boring. Could not finish it, stopped at page 100 and browsed until the last page to see what happened ...  Even the cover is not OK (look at the PAWS of the male !)  Would have rated ZERO stars if possible ... 
 this album is terrible.  just useless noise.  i also own electric pink and very emergency.  if you liked those albums, you will agree that this one is garbage 
 It's a nice looking book on the bookshelf, but having tried several of the recipes, I think this is a case of the critic trying to become the star.  The walnut bread recipe required additional liquid to come together and then was doughy and tough (and I bake.)  The braised leg of lamb was just... well, boring.  The thin apple tart was also just a boring mess.  And so on.  Some of the recipes aren't so much recipes as serving suggestions... get some goat cheese, eat it.  Grind some pepper on buttered bread.  The writing style is also pretentious.  The author likes to enrich the reader with how tight she is with all the great chefs of Paris.  She protests too much how Parisian she is.  Make mine Veuve-Clicquot!  Oh, puh-lease.  Putting this book on a par with Julia Childs is like saying 'I know of a few French cookbooks, and this is one.  Julia Childs wrote one, too.'  This book just feels like another American trying to make a living in Paris by cranking out a thrown off collection of mediocre recipes and "I was there" anecdotes.    Pass on this one 
 my purchase arrived in good time. case was in good condition. said it was new but the cds didnt play good. some episodes would skip and not play at all, not very happy with item. 
 I had looked so forward to Mott-Davidson's latest book. It just wasn't as good as the others. I see that there are many other reviews that agree with me. What in the world happened? Has she perhaps, 'passed the torch'? It just doesn't seem like her usual style. It was disjointed, there were a couple of really huge mistakes. She introduced two new characters, insinuating, they had always been there. It was a mess. I can only hope that the next one, if there is a next one, is better. C'mon Diane, don't let us down! 
 This canister vac might be ok for VERY light duty, but don't expect it to handle any "real" housecleaning.  The filter clogs easily and this item is very prone to overheating, which leads to long waiting times because it turns off when it gets too hot.  If I had it to do over again, I would not purchase this vac.  I would save up and buy a better canister vacuum 
 This is a really weak and uninspired translation - really a rewriting - of Brother Lawrence's classic little book.  The author/translator says that this is a "thought-for-thought" translation rather than a literal one, and admits that this is a risky proposition.  He's right that it's risky, especially when a writer is careless and takes unwarranted license with a text, and unfortunately he's failed in his attempt.  It could and should have been otherwise.  The author goes overboard trying to make the book sound contemporary, filling it with American colloquialisms and excessive informality to the point that it often sounds like a trivial conversation between teenagers ("let's bulldoze the dike that holds back God's flood," "let's cash in lost time," "if death is tailgating us, we need to be ready," "life offers no `do-overs'," don't look for the pleasure payoff," and on and on).  There are places where subject and verb don't agree and other grammatical or stylistic errors cause a lack of clarity.  When a writer allows himself great license, he can't blame problems like these on the original text.  The author has been a news reporter and advertising copywriter, and it shows.  This is too important a book to be treated with this much sloppiness and irreverence.  I'm surprised at NavPress for letting this one slip through, and I strongly suggest that you buy a better version (the Whitaker House version, for example, is better and cheaper) 
 This miniature edition is too small to be of much value.  When I purchased it, it was not at all obvious that it was a miniature edition, and I was shocked when it arrived.  If you're already familiar with the book, it may be a helpful reminder, but it is no way to become familiar with Dr. Peale's work.  It is not worth the 4.95 I paid for it, and the 3.99 shipping and handling is ludicrous 
 do yourself a favor - don't waste your time with this book 
 although prince is an utter genious! this cd is merely a boring contract filler. i suggest you buy one of his older albums or the new album "musicology" instead 
 Peter was a fair book. I enjoyed reading Peter, however the ending was not satisfying. As I have learned over the years from reading many books, you cannot decide how the book ends. This may seem strange, however, I was disappointed by the ending. Peter was not particularly my taste: a funny, suspenseful book with a firm closing ending. Rather, it is a real-life book teaching a lesson. Whether or not you pick this book is up to you, but if you are looking for a good book to read and found this book by picking at random, or it looked interesting, I recommend that you continue your search. I rate Peter with 2 to 3 stars 
 I've read a lot of Stephen King's work, and loved most of it, but 'Firestarter' was a big letdown!  It's not quite in the 'abomination' category of 'From a Buick 8', but at least King could blame that one on his car accident. This one is probably only about as good as 'The Tommyknockers.' The premise is great, but once it gets away from 'Andy and Charlie on the run', and becomes 'The Life Story of Tom Rainbird', it goes downhill very quickly! Not to knock King too much, but as this books goes along, it seems obvious that SK was losing interest, either because he found the two lead characters too limiting for whatever reason, and wanted to 'explore' the supporting characters more; or simply because this book came out fairly early in King's career, when he was known to partake of certain 'substances' which he later swore off! Worth reading only if you really want to read every SK novel. Otherwise, just be glad that nearly every book he wrote after this one(with the exception of the two mentioned above) surpasses 'Firestarter' 
 It's a good text for Precalculus as long as you have someone along to check your work, the CD is basically useless.  The first two chapters don't load some of the animations due to Java errors on Windows, and there are no practice tests on the CD.  The answers in the back are fine, as long as you know how to get them.  This version DESPERATELY needs the study guide 
 To prospective buyers it may be helpful to know that this is a British book: the selection of names is heavily influenced by this. For example "lacewood" is given here in the literal sense, as quartersawn wood of a species with high rays, with a "lacy" ray fleck, originally Platanus spp. Later (although the book omits to mention this) the woods of the Proteaceae (both the Australian silky oaks and the South American roupala) were also so used. The American use of "lacewood" for the Australian silky oaks, however sawn, is somewhat of a misnomer 
 Jim Powell's book would have made an excellent op-ed piece in the Sunday New York Times or essay in The Weekly Standard, but it is not a strong work of sustained historical research and analysis. His central argument that American entry into World War I (not merely the Treaty of Versailles) paved the way for the rise of Hitler, the triumph of Lenin and Stalin, and the coming of World War II is compelling.  Many historians have written about the tragic consequences of the failed peace and about Wilson's nave belief that he could control the machinations and jealousies of the European powers, but Powell makes the more provocative case that the world would have been better off had the U.S. allowed World War I to end in a stalemate.    What is disappointing about this book (and about the lavish praise it has received in other reviews) is the shallowness of its research and its disdain for historical context. Primary sources are almost entirely absent from the endnotes. Incredibly, this book devoted to an indictment of Wilson for "his" war does not even mention Theodore Roosevelt, Leonard Wood, or any of the apostles of preparedness to whom Wilson was reacting politically. Powell did not consult the important books of N. Gordon Levin, Jr., or Lawrence Gelfand that lay out in great detail the ideological origins and objectives of Wilson's Fourteen Points. Readers of this book unfortunately will come away with insufficient understanding of how and why Woodrow Wilson formulated the foreign policy that Powell finds so historically destructive.  Readers may also come away thinking that Jim Powell has blown the cover off of the Wilson mythology - a mythology constructed and nurtured by historians Thomas A. Bailey and Arthur Link.  Like other recent works of "revisionism" (such as Thomas DiLorenzo's The Real Lincoln), Powell creates a straw-man "conventional view" of his subject and fails to give adequate credit to previous generations of revisionist historians. The job of challenging Wilson's historical image as progressive idealist was already accomplished decades ago, ironically, by historians from the opposite ideological pole. The "New Left" historians of the 1960s indicted Wilson's interventionism because they believed it planted the seeds of America's involvement in Vietnam, Central America, and other conflicts of the Cold War era.   Powell seems more interested in demonstrating the efficacy of his four principles that should guide the making of U.S. foreign policy and the managing of political economy than he is in writing sound history. The libertarian ideology of the Cato Institute (where he is a senior fellow) is apparent on virtually every page. The information he imparts sometimes seems oddly chosen as historical evidence, but makes sense as building blocks for the ideological edifice he constructs.  This kind of writing makes for an effective essay, but does little to enlighten us about the making of U.S. foreign policy.   
 This book is boring as hel 
 I bought this for my 5-year-old niece and was very disappointed. I bought the Spanish-English version because I thought it would be educational and most of what DK makes is excellent. There are a lot of stickers, but the book focuses on placing them in the "right" place which seems pointless. I thought they would have more scenes to allow children to use their imaginations but there is only 1. On top of that, the stickers are supposed to be reusable but they really aren't 
 This book is OK for learning what it covers. Also, considering Gussow's Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity was last published in 1983, age might also have been a factor. However, the regular Schaum's on this subject just came out in December 2006, and it has been extensively updated and covers the material this book covers and much more, plus it is just as easy to follow as this book is. You get an extra 300 pages of material for an extra two dollars. If you need to learn the material in this Easy Outline, you are going to eventually need to know the material in Schaum's Outline of Basic Electricity, 2nd Edition, so you might as well just buy that one book 
 A pathetically boring book. It just carries rhetorical dialogue between the two main characters & never really develops the main story well. The bickering between Kerry & Silver becomes boring drivel & is endless. The Firestorm, & how it's carried off, remains mostly a mystery hidden away. There's a devious North Korean who remains faceless and is never developed. The author tries to save it with a twist toward the end, but by that time you're so bored it's anti-climatic and I didn't care. The best thing about the book is it's cover. Bottom line? Save your money, unless you have trouble sleeping, that is. 
 The book had a far-fetched premise, but once I was able to move past that detail, the book was readable, albeit unrealistic.    Without giving away anything significant, I can tell you that a major portion of the book was centered around a police officer assuming an alias.  Unfortunately, I was a little surprised, and very disappointed in the way the author chose to "reveal" the main undercover operation to the criminal.  The unraveling of the cover was brought about by a mistake that I found completely innane.  I could not believe that a rookie, much less a seasoned officer would slip up as the author has Carol (and Tony) slip up.  This disbelief is compounded by the lengths that are taken initially to insure that the operation is not comprimised.  I was disappointed enough in the book to move along to another author, as opposed to reading the rest of the Carol Jordan/Tony Hill saga.  I thought the writing skills of the author were good, but the storytelling skills were not. 
 I agree with all the one star reviews that this book lacks everything. I've read quite a few E. Leonard books and enjoyed most of them. This was his worst so far 
 Sophomoric, inappropriate, attempts at song and humor, mixed with a bizarre, confusing, and uninteresting plot, equal a  big waste of time for the viewer. A good one to avoid 
 I used to love Outburn magazine. I first discovered it when I came across the mag at a local mainstream bookstore chain. The first thing I saw on the cover was VNV Nation. I bought that issue and soon after that I ordered a subscription. What I loved about Outburn at the time was that the magazine covered artists and bands that aren't covered in the mainstream music magazines, namely those in the goth, EBM, synthpop, and industrial scene. Unfortunately within the next year and a half, the magazine started covering less of those types of bands and more death metal bands and hardcore punk bands, two genres I don't give a rat's behind about. I don't know WTF happened at the magazine but they stopped covering anything goth related and started covering more music I would much rather have my ears ripped off by pliers than listen to. Just like Alternative Press, Outburn started out as a cool mag but now they have become a joke and more about following than setting trends 
 I debated whether to give this book 1 or 2 stars. At first I was going to give it 2 stars as I thought LKH did a better job with this book than she did with the ABVH book Danse Macabre. I settled on 1 star after thinking about all of the things that bothered and/or disappointed me about this book.   My biggest problem were the scenes with Sholto. I hated what she did to him which I'm not going to say because I don't want to give anything away. However, to me it seemed like LKH was taking the easy way out. She took away any "specialness" and made it "ordinary". The scenes between Merry and Sholto could have been Merry and AnyGuy.   There were many other disappointments for me in this book. I'm not sure if the deficiencies of Mistral's Kiss were magnified for me as I had just finished reading a number of books (the latest from Kim Harrison, JR Ward and Lynsay Sands to start) which, IMO, were head and shoulders above anything coming from LKH lately. 
 The first time I wrote a review for this book, I gave it 5 stars.However, this book is the least accurate of all the Lucy book I have read, and I have read a lot.  While I was reading it, I noticed that some of the things Mr. Brochu said about Lucy directly contradicted with her autobiography. I didn't think much of it at the time, but then I went to Luie Arnaz's website. She distinctly said that this book was not accurate at all and to skip it.Then everything started to fall into place. This is as much of a cartoon of Lucy's life as anything. Yes, it's touching, but what good is touching if it's not true? Everytime I think about the fact that Mr. Brochu so plainly lied, it infuriates me to tears. If you want to know the REAL Lucy, skip this book. Go staright to her own touching, candid memoirs, "Love, Lucy.&quot 
 This slim volume might be worth the price at 18 dollars, but the $45 students are forced to pay for this book, used as a textbook, is outrageous. The book's vocabulary and its assumptions about the level of knowledge of the reader lumps it in with juvenile literature. For example, it tells the reader that ancient Greeks and Romans had a democratic form of government, and that democracy means the citizens vote, just like in the United States.   The book appears an attempt to "candy-coat" (almost literally!) history for cooking students who are assumed to know nothing of it. It has long sections of history at a 9th-grader's level, with only minimal coverage of foodstuffs at some points.   Worse, it is riddled with errors and inaccuracies. For example, the last section I read before returning it for a refund covered sourdough bread. Civitello said that San Francisco sourdough really is different, as San Franciscans claim, because "the yeast in the air of San Francisco is a different variety, lactobacillus sanfrancisco." This is blatantly wrong, as lactobacillus is a bacterium and yeast is a mold. It was delightful to learn, after some online research, that the bacterium lactobacillus sanfrancisco does contribute to the unique taste of San Francisco sourdough. But the statement in the book was clearly wrong, and typical of the level of accuracy throughout 
 Straight up: Dip Set is garbage. This album is no exception, although in comparison to all the albums that they released, this is one of the better ones. Trufully, Cam'ron has very limited lyrical skills, and it displays throughout this album. Although during this time this album was released, he was just signed to Jay-Z's Roc-A-Fella Records (you saw how long that lasted). Also around this time, some of the Dip Set artists (Jim Jones and Juelz Santana) were starting to surface. They themselves also weigh this album down. I did like the first single "Oh Boy". Also the second single "Hey Ma" was good also. The album's hugh highlight would be "Welcome To New York" featuring Jay-Z, that was well thought out.  The album also has many low points. A lot of these songs like "Loosing Weight 2" shows how very limited Cam'ron's skills are behind the mic. Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel do absolutely nothing for the song "The Roc". Production is good, like the Daz produced "Leave Me Alone", but Cam couldn't pull it together. Just Blaze and Kanye West would also toss in a few beats on this album also.  "Come Home With Me" is average at best. It has a few good songs and a lot of skip material. If you're used to hearing Cam on albums, then you might want to check this out for a few good tracks, or download it to hear how it sounds like. This isn't one I could fully get into.   Lyrics: C Production: B+ Guest Appearances: C- Musical Vibes: C Overall: C  Favorite Tracks: Oh Boy, Welcome To New York City, Hey Ma,   Peace Everyone 
 Jensen's biography of Schumann is a merely adequate portrayal of this most extraordinary composer. The prose is incredibly flat and repetitive--the "insight" that Schumann loved children--hardly original considering the "Kinderszenen" and "Album fur die Jugend"--is made several times, though any further elucidation is avoided. Another glaring failure of the book is the lack of musical analysis. After spending far too much time on the youthful "Papillons," Jensen practically ignores such ground-breaking works as the "Gesange der Fruhe" and the eerily gorgeous "Geistervariationen." Often, such works receive only a curious aside, such as "dense texture" and the like. Altogether an unsatisfying read 
 The topic of this book is very interesting: espionage in the Revolutionary War. Unfortunately, "Washington's Spies" goes into so much nit-picking detail that, as the cliche goes, you can't see the forest for the trees. To really get anything out of this book, you'd have to be a *very* dedicated Revolutionary War buff. It didn't have much appeal at all to me as a general reader.  
 Title is self explanatory, I'm very busy to write reviews but I needed to make this one, make sure nobody gets fooled by brand name , at medium prices and ultra low quality. I've bought a 5$ nobrand knife from TOP and is WAY better that this 
 As have other reviewers, I found this book gives enough information to get me in trouble or to get me frustrated but doesn't give enough details or explanations or even examples to get me out of them.  You could do several things using the book but if you tried to do something very different from what he illustrated you'd probably get mysterious error messages and little or no help understanding what the problem is.  I have used the Missing Manual for going from Windows to Mac and found it far more helpful than this book.  I'd urge you to spend a bit more and get something much more complete.  I just bought "Applescript The Definitive Guide (2'nd. ed.)" by M. Neuburg and I'm hopeful it will meet my needs.  I notice there are several other books available here for beginners and I'd consider some of them before getting this one 
 why is this the second book in a werewolf based series? ross was only a suporting charater and really only a tool the author used to bridge the gaps in the story so she could get back to the smut.. as a werewolf fan and not a romance fan i wished i just skipped this book and gone straight to the 3rd book. i've read all 3 books already and you can safely skip the second book and go to the 3rd and not miss much at all. the 3rd basically fills you in enough about the second book that even if she writes a forth with charaters from the second book you could still understand everything 
 What a disappointment! Poorly written, bitter, jealous and small minded. Less said the better 
 Don't buy this one by mistake, why they even released this one...i don't know.  It is a bilious condition that causes all hollywood movie scores to sound so blandly offensive, some more watered down classical tripe, from the john williams school of psuedo classical music, oh well, you still have Zooey to help keep you warm, buy the other one 
 The books are in fine condition.  My problem is with Amazon! I will never buy text books on Amazon again!  Waited over 2 months for the books that were promised within 10 days.  Not just one book, but 5 out of 8 that I ordered. Never, Never again! 
 This film is poorly shot, the sound is terrible, the Pythons look disinterested.  This DVD is TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT IT IS.  It needs to be a 9.99 special.    Save your money, buy Holy Grail, Meaning of Life, Life of Brian...etc.  If you really want the sketches from the show...BUY THE SHOW.     Or even better, spend a little more money and buy Fawlty Towers on DVD.  A much better investment and far, far funnier.  
 Norris's book is a good place to start, but he writes with a heavy Victorian bias, and frequently makes a lot of the details up. It's a good basic overview, for costumes and such, but if you're looking for real, authentic, accuratey researched information, such as for the SCA, this is not a reliable source. Aside from accuracy, he completely ignores large sections of Europe - Italy, Scandinavia, Spain - and focuses on England, France, and Germany 
 Meanwhile a lot of other people written very good books in a very different stile: Suzanne Clothier (Bones would rain from the Sky) Patricia McConnell (The other end of the Leash) Turid Rugaas (Calming Signals)  We have three Irish Setter and we prefer a soft method for our dogs 
 The is a review of a pharmacy student. Unfortunately, this is a required text for my medchem/pharmacology class. You can ask any student in my class and majority of us would have the same complaint. This book is extremely difficult to follow. For example they give you a table for alpha and beta adrenergic receptors. While the table is more or less OK describing different beta receptor types, it doesn't tell much about alpha receptors. The authors of this omit a lot of important details.  They don't write much about medications' side effects. In general this book makes it difficult to distinguish medications of each group from each other. On the better side, the book provides a lot of chemical structures, which make medchem part easier 
 I got this book because of the fame of John Gary and the big title of the book. I managed to go through half of the book and finally, I cannot stand it and throw it away.  Basically, this book gives you 9 principles to bring miracles to your life, like eating healthy, love as if it is your first love, blablablah. Yeah, it is true, but it is also totally vain and misleading. For example, everybody knows that if you eat healthy food and work out intensively four times a week, two hours each time, you will definitely be fit as supermodel. But, can anybody really do that if somebody just told you to do so? It has to be tricky to deal with like finding the right and affordable workout program, finding the incentive, etc.  What I found ridiculous is that John kept saying that if you believe in his nine principles, then you can do whatever you want. Even superman cannot do that! Well, John, have you accomplished all of your wishes in your life? Belief is necessary for any success, but it is not a guarantee for all successes.  Also, John made some metaphors to prove his points, but most of them don't make enough or any sense, at least to me. Another reason I hate the book is that it takes the first 1/3 to boast his former achievements, like 12 bestsellers, without touching the core topic of this book.  If you are looking for practical miracles in this book, I assure you that you will be practically disappointed, period 
 I bought this book to add more to my upcoming trip to Wyoming in October.  I was hoping to read exciting stories from Wyoming's past like the adventures of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang.  However, this book is very encyclopedic and dry in its presentation of Wyoming's data.  The information on the weather will be handy, but I could have done without the pages upon pages of data on soil composition and historical costs of cattle.  This book is certainly full of information, just don't expect to be entertained by it 
 Steve Albini has got to be the most sanctimonious, self-possessed, pompous [person] in the entire music industry. He emerges in one hysterically pretentious band after another. He's hailed as some sort of guru by "alternative" people, when he's actually nothing but an uninformed, homophobic piece of ****. In the song "Jordan, Minnesota" he slanders innocent parents for molesting their children even though the true story is all over the net. Ever heard of research, Steve? Guess not, you've probably been too busy sleeping with prostitutes and pissing on other bands equipment (yeah, I read the tour diary). As for the "music", this is a record by and for people who hate music 
 Ok I know this DVD is not out when I write this review. But I've seen the movie back in Asia when it was released in theater about 1.5 years ago. The movie is based on a novel called "Seven swords" (duh). I have personally read the entire story (book) and I have to say it was quite good. But the movie version was a big let down. First of all, a long and complicated story is squeezed into a 2 hour long movie. Many aspects related to the characters which are also crucial for understanding the story are missed out. My friend who had never read the book was somewhat confused and found the movie a drag as it went on. The next big problem is the actors and actresses. Frankly, the acting is plain terrible. Especially Leon Lai, an untalented singer who can neither act nor sing but makes millions of dollars off fanatic fans, was absolutely unbearable. Last but not least, the special effects. I'm not sure if the movie maker didn't know how to make it good, or they were just trying to do things the easy way and didn't care about the outcome. It almost seems like every single action is incomplete and cut short. The result is not only unexciting, but irritating. Well, at least that's what I thought when I saw it. So my advice is, go rent the movie if you really wanna see it. It could possibly end up as a disappointment 
 I have experienced exactly the same result like the comments of following persons: - The reader of September 30,1998.  - The reader "Ron Lininger" from Febuary 9,1999 and especially the reader from  Sunnyvale,CA,July 21,1998 
 Just another wanna be somebody, using the tired old trodge stuff. Like a previous bright lad said, `Heresay`. Wonder why they don`t consider self immolation to get attention....now THAT would be worth reading about. AND we could bring chestnuts. As for George nicking somebody elses song....oh dear. And of course, the only place that the Beatles went, was america. Typical yank author..two places in the world. america and notamerica. Toilet paper might work if the ink isn`t as cheap as the scribbler. Not worth a zac.  BTW the software advised that I HAD to award this crud with at least one star or the review would not get posted...hence the one star where I gave it minus 5 stars (idea would be to give us a choice of bouquets or brickbats doncha think??) 
 This is a collection of articles written for Petrowski's monthly column in American Scientist magazine. Many are brief biographies of 19th-century engineers; a (very) few look (very) briefly at particular pieces of historical engineering (an article on the Ferris wheel is probably the best); others are ruminations on such hazards of the engineering practice as the stress that keeps them up at night and their failure to be awarded Nobel prizes. These seem quite satisfactory articles for a magazine column but they are slender stuff for a book. And Petroski's tendency to return to the same subjects, pardonable in a monthly column, becomes repetitive when the columns are collected. All but die-hard Petroski fans can skip this on 
 We checked this book out of the library for our 3-year old son without looking through it first.  It had a cute title and a cute cover, plus our son loves dogs.  Were we surprised!  The story takes a dark twist at the end with the mom held at gun-point by a burglar, who basically threatens to kill them. We found this scary, not to mention inappropriate for a children's picture book. I cannot recommend this book to anyone with young children 
 to try and re create NWA with the west coast best is a good idea but it cant be done. The sound of NWA was so raw loud and straight ghetto that this remake serves as a sorry re mak 
 Or perhaps I should have said Nazi-science. Extremist Budiansky seems to have picked up where the likes of the Nazi-mentality left off. This absurd diatrbe should certainly not be listed amongst any legitimate science writings as it has nothing to do with real science, but rather, the author attempts to pass off his hateful agenda of others, as science; nonsense. Do yourself a favor---save your hard-earned money, you certainly won't be missing anything with this one....except precious time 
 Looking down on the cityscape, skyscrapers seem like tubes of lipstick.  Much as a lipstick tube is a phalliform receptacle containing a 'feminine' substance, women now dwell within the structures that men created.  Men and women belong to opposing camps.  It is now men who are 'feminized' and women who assume sovereignty; it is women who take on all of the symbolic traits of maleness.  The difference between the genders is absolute.  The separation between them may be ontological, stable, fixed, but power is not.  Power is dynamic, kinetic, mobile: "If you can wield it, you have it."  And now women have the power.  They are ruling the world.  So goes LIPSTICK JUNGLE, the new novel by Candace Bushnell.  What is the status of a man in a universe universally dominated by women?  Men are either ridiculously spineless, endearingly brainless, or flamboyantly insane.  Some of them are sex-mannequins (Kirby Atwood); others are Icarian billionaires (Lyne Bennett and Victor Matrick)---falling or already fallen, paving the way for the baronesses who will usurp their place in the Lipstick Jungle.  Some of them are oviphages ("egg-eaters") (Kirby); others have a distaste for les oeufs scrambled (Seymour).  And then there are the vaguely East Asian or Eastern European parasites that populate the novel like so much vermin.  Bushnell's racism / nationalism / class arrogance is evident on every other page.  Unlike SEX AND THE CITY's swinging femmes, the women of LIPSTICK JUNGLE do not have an enduring interest in sex.  They are solely interested in power, wealth, and class.  Their beauty is self-illuminated.  Sex may be a pastime or a release, but it is not a goal.  Nor is the family of much importance.  Children are nondescript leeches and noise-makers.  An infant's first word is "Money!"  If you strip away identity, what remains is the naked desire for cash, the most fundamental of human impulses. Even prior to the assumption of an identity, the human animal desires the power to purchase...  Each huntress is defined not by the men who surround her, but by the products she owns or wants to own. Nico O'Neilly's most essential features are represented by a diamond. Victory Ford is defined by her "black American Express card"---since she, after all, is also a credit card.  Victory Ford, Wendy Healy, Nico O'Neilly---the three "protagonists" are three versions of a single self.  We move from the description of one character to the next.  When the narrative centers on one character, the others vanish, as if they were chimeras of her imagination.  LIPSTICK JUNGLE never critiques the culture; it repeats the values of the culture unreflectively.  To say that, "Women ought to be ruling the world" is neither a revolutionary insight nor a challenge to the culture.  Seen from this perspective, the women of LIPSTICK JUNGELE are hardly women at all.  This is not a feminism in which women come into their own as women.  Its philosophy is a particular kind of gendered Darwinism.  Women must adopt negative male traits in order to achieve sovereignty, must become men in woman costumes.

 I couldn't read the whole thing in order to know for sure. It was dry. I didn't get the imagery - I know it's supposed to be a classic, and I really wanted to read the book, I did - but it was long and boring and I just don't get why it's so "classicly popular". Sorry, but it's how I feel. Now, that being said, I read a condensed version of it, and I discovered the story was a little bit interesting - but that's as far as I can go, even with the condensed version - it was only "a little bit" interesting 
 I was required to read this book for a college level Appalachain Appreciation class. This book was praised for its story telling abilities and discription of Appalachain culture. While it succeeded in telling a story of a cursed, inbred family, it failed to keep me awake long enough to finish in time for the deadline. The book entertains a host of narrators (maybe entertains isn't the right word) that losely follow a century of the Cantrell family. This book was the fifth book author Lee Smith wrote, following four massive failures. She continued the trend here dragging out a campfire tale for 300 pages. I reluctantly finished the book hopeing for a smashing ending to save myself from feeling like I had waisted my time. Unfortunatly that didn't happen. I don't want to spoil the ending for you, Lee Smith will though. Long story short, save your money 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I've read several selections from Oprah's Book Club and have thoroughly enjoyed the vast majority of them, that's why it confuses me as to why this book should be chosen.  The level of writing borders between two extremes: overdone and shocking, and downright dull.  I generally do not mind subject matter that is lewd and shocking as long as it is coupled with strong, engaging writing, which this book lacks. With very few exceptions I found myself unable to connect with the main characters or the storyline.  I do encourage readers who may be new to the Oprah's book club to keep reading, not all of the selections are this bad 
 I love art and SF fantasy illustration and I am an admirer of Lovecraft's writing skill and imagination. The cover art on the book is great! The interior work does not suffer for quaility, so why the low review?  Because I found the book itself disappointing, it lacks inspiration. I have seen most of the images online. I don't doubt that many of the artist are fellow fans of Lovecraftian lore and imagery, but they (as far as I know) got paid to paint these illustrations for the CoC card game, hardly a paeon to the muses.  To be fair, I was warned by several of the reviewers of what the contents amounted to, it was the reviewers who were gushing about a book with a fair amount of mediocre art work that I could have paid less heed to.  If you are desperate for Cthulhu related images, get it. If your merely curious, let it pass. 
 If you are a single woman without children, this is not the book for you.  I was extremely disappointed in this book, especially given all the five star ratings.  It took me less then ten minutes to read any portion relevant to my own life, as it was almost exclusively about maintaining friendships when you are married and especially if you have children.  Furthermore, I completely reject the idea that a woman without children must make all the sacrifices to maintain a friendship with a woman who has children which is the premise of this book.  Friendship is a balancing act and the sacrifices should not be placed on the shoulders of one person.  And while other reviews have stated this book says men do not need friends, I did not see that.  However, this book is exclusively about female friendships with other females and does not include men in the equation at all.  After all, women can be friends with men.  
 My local radio morning show was raving about this book, so I just had to order it.  What they didn't mention was that this book is FULL of the "F" word, and many of the notes are very sexually explicit.  May be a selling point for some, but not for me.  I just received it today, and it's now in the recycle bin.  Was going to give it to my husband for Christmas...glad I opened it first 
 Listening to "Doctor" Laura is akin to watching a pit bull eat the arm off someone who WILLINGLY sticks it through the fence. I think she looks awful (plastic surgery, "doctor"?). I end up laughing at EVERYONE who makes it on the air (you have to suspect only those easily cowed are sent through the woodchipper). These poor callers have no strength, their need for help notwithstanding. No one with a whit of self-respect would let this witch verbally batter them. Still, it's entertaining to hear them let "Doctor" Laura tear them limb from limb. It's sadistic, but sad. Sometimes you have to turn away whenever these sad sacks look to her to be their domineering, surrogate mommy 
 Yes, that's right.  This worked for me for only one day.  What a disappointment 
 The worksheets are helpful in applying what Malphurs has just covered. The book is loaded with practical hints and tips. The biggest drawback is that Malphurs relies too heavily on statistics that are questionable and cites some that contradict each other. By that I mean that he cites a statistic about 'Protestant' churches which includes Mormons and Jehovah's Witness. Instead I would recommend Stuart Murray's "Church Planting: Laying Foundations" 
     I thought I was the only one having trouble with the crate pans.  I have a Golden retriever and have the crate only six months and the crate pan totally broke apart.  I cannot find a replacement for it.  I have one on order from J-B Wholesale but after reading the other review, I am going to cancel my order.  I don't know what to do for my puppy now? I truly am disappointed with the product.   
 The ghost writer was probably afraid to put his own name on the book.  It was totally predictable without any of the depth found in real Ludlum books 
 C.K. Prahalad must be getting a bit long in the tooth. Or perhaps he has had difficulty in recent years finding a co-author as talented as Gary Hamel. Whatever his excuse, his latest book is a disappointing throwback to specious management bestsellers of the 80s and 90s.  Prahalad's book is long on clichs and short on insight.  The central thesis of the book is a rehash of Kotler's better articulted work on the prosumer. Given all of their emphasis on "value co-creation" the book seems woefully short on profitability and ROI numbers.  I couldn't find any case studies that showed the value in value co-creation. At the same time, truly innovative and competitive "value co-creation" businesses - Linux, Apache and the whole open source software movement which Microsoft now finds so threatening - are barely mentioned. Are we just to take the authors' word for it that companies adopting a "C-type" structure are automatically profitable?  Hmm.  Maybe it depends on whether these firms adopt "X,Y, or Z-type" management.  Can lucrative consulting gigs be far behind 
 book was one that i wanted, but because of an error at the printers, many pages were missing 
 If you can use the internet,and more specifically a search engine,theres nothing in this book helpful.Find a few good resellers online,ones with reveiws and product links,and you not only get quick knowledge but save alot of time and money 
 Let me tell you something that I really can't stand. An instructor  who assigns a book that you have to pay full price for and only assigns 3 chapters for you to read. I hated this book. It was a waste of time reading it and a waste of money. I tried to sell this book back and was offered $0.00 for it. So what does that tell you? I eventually threw the book in the trash because that's where it belonged. I couldn't enjoy Brants Native American culture without her mixing her lesbianism into it. I have no interest in that type of combination at all and I don't give a rats behind about her "liquid energy" and getting caught being intimate with her friend. If you insist reading this book, get it from the library 
 I work in finance and create many charts and graphs. I figured a book like this would help me to design them better. I was really looking for a practical guide rather than a long, rambling academic textbook, but that's how this book reads.   It seems aimed at college underclassmen rather than business professionals. Few spends page after page discussing the most basic mathematical concepts and things that you simply don't need to know in order to create a graph. For example, there is an entire chapter on basic statistics such as how to calculate a mean, median and mode. There is also a lengthy discussion of how the human eye works.  As I went through the book I found myself thinking: "Wow, Few has so little to say about tables and graphs that he needs all of this filler material to make this seem like a real book!"  There are some valuable chapters at the end of the book, but it takes a lot of patience to get there.  The page format is also really annoying and too textbook-like. It is a really wide book with citations (90% of which seemed to be from Tufte) in the wide margins.  I give this review one star for the 15 or so pages worth of good advice it contains. Unfortunately that wasn't enough content to warrant an entire textbook If you're a business professional looking for something you can use, this book is VASTLY overpriced and oversized.  My final comment is on the cover: An eye. A Brain. A sun. Bars coming out of each. It says very little to me, and that seemed to be the theme of the book. I wish I'd have seen a real review on this book before I shelled out $30.   
 I turn to these reviews to help me decide on a purchase.  Unfortunately, in this case, the reviews are almost worthless because they are obvious plugs by the publisher, author or their friends.  There are even two identical reviews back to back.  This system needs some screening to make reviews of these types of products relevant and not self-serving hype 
 Sadly, this thrilling sea-yarn from 1897 is nearly unreadable today.  Between the seafaring jargon - which must have delighted boys of yore - and the unfathomable dialects, it can take ages to puzzle out a page.  Some of the anecdotes related by the good seamen of the schooner "We're Here," which has picked up over-privileged Harvey Cheyne when he was washed overboard from a luxury liner, I could not grasp the point or moral of.  My husband has read all the Patrick O'Brian series, so I asked him to puzzle out a representative story, that of Counahan the Navigator, and after spending 15 minutes reading me a few pages aloud and filling me in on the few terms he understood, he said, "Honey, I see what you mean."   One can get the general gist, but it's best to read through fast, then go back and see if any of it makes any more sense.    	For example, when educated Harvey says, "Why can't we always fish from the boat instead of from the dories?" his pal Dan answers, "Allus can, till we begin to dress daown.  Efter thet, the heads and offals, 'u'd scare the fish to Fundy.  Boat-fishin' ain't reckoned progressive, though, unless ye know as much as dad knows.  Guess we'll run aout aour trawl to-night.  Harder on the back, this, than frum the dory, ain't it?"  	I got my B.A. in English, and I would rather tackle Joyce's "Ulysses" than an unannotated version of this book.   	So why did I bother?  A few days ago, a friend showed us the DVD of the 1937 movie, starring Spencer Tracy and Lionel Barrymore, on his big screen home theater, and it was thrilling and very moving.  The movie is quite different from the book, though, but it may give some incentive to check out for oneself how Kipling crafted the story, as it did for me.  But dear teachers, PLEASE, do not subject students to this particular title unless you are going to spend the semester on it and are willing to turn them off classic literature forever!  (Let them read "Cannery Row" instead!)  
 I am surprised that when people read the printed word, they believe it, whether the words are true or not. There are many glowing reviews here but only a few really call this book what it is, its fiction. This book would be a great novel and it reads like one. The author takes himself for a talented writer in his eloquent but very disjointed writing style. I never knew where I was in the time line in this book. What really turned me off was the part about flying blind down the canyon to escape the Mig. This part is straight out of, "Hunt for Red October", with Sean Connery. The Navigator "remembers" how the canyon looks so he can just time the turns while they fly blind. Flying a C-123 at 50Kts is pure BS. If you notice in the 12 months of flying, the author only talks about 2 or 3 incidents that are even remotely hair raising. He admits that in all the time the unit has been flying C-123', they have lost only one C-123. The rest of the book wanders back and forth in an effort to fill pages with text. Finally, the exciting ending with a night landing at a secret airfield caps this boring book. I also couldn't figure out why someone who hated the military so much spent 26 years in it. I flew as a pilot in the Air Force and I find this book unconvincing. Heed the few reviews that give this book one or two stars and find some thing more truthfull to read 
 Sorry 'bout that pun!  It's difficult watching a group of amazingly talented actors try to make something out of this mess of a script.  Unfortunately Heather Morgan, who plays Lucy, wrote the screenplay and didn't do herself any favors.    The premise of a man watching his emotionally delicate wife's mental stability disintegrate to the point of where she recedes into life as a dog holds some promise, but it isn't fully realized here.  Secondary characters, particularly Lisa Kudrow as the veterinarian seem lost at sea.    There is something of the indulgent feel of an actor's improvisatory workshop at work here, a sort of "let's assemble a group of independently odd characters and place them into a collective situation."  With all of the characters wildly left of center there is little more than Lee Tergeson's slowly unhinging Peter to draw comparisons with normality to on the whack-o-meter.  Hank Azaria tries, but isn't given any meat to work with and his fairly large amount of screen time feels wasted.  How do you NOT use a talent like Azaria who pretty much livens up anything just by being there.   Evidently, this is how.  Heather Morgan actually makes the most of the role she's given herself and she veers from wildly annoying to earning this viewer's sympathy at her handling by the psychiatric/medical professionals.    Vincent D'Onofrio does manage to add another winner to his aresenal of misfits.  A brief bit with him playing Vivaldi on a harp is the highlight of the film.    Everyone gives there all and you want to route for them - Tergeson most of all - but an earthbound script keeps the entire thing from ever becoming anything special.  Too bad 
 I learned quite a few interesting things about life from this movie.  This movie seemed to have quite a lot of plot holes.  Anyway, here is what I learnt about the world from this movie -   1) The yakuza (they play the bad guys in this movie) have nothing better to do than race cars.  2) If you are a car racer, you will never have to do jail time for any crimes you commit.   3) If you cannot drive at top speed and make hairpin turns through a car park without crashing into something, you are a loser.  4) Only gorgeous girls and guys with perfect bodies can drift.  5) Everyone in the school is either rich, gorgeous or a gangster.  6) It is perfectly okay to offer your car to a total stranger in a race - just to see what he's made of.  7) Even if you get in a race containing three cars and drive at top speed through a full city, and end up killing someone, then the police will do nothing about it.  8) If you are beautiful and blonde, it is a good idea to offer yourself up as the prize for a race, so your boyfriend gets involved in a race with another guy and almost kills all three of you.  9) It is an even better idea to scream at your boyfriend that he doesn't love you when he is neck-and-neck with another car, so that he rams into the other car on purpose.  10) If you walk away from a fight, you are a loser.  
 To build upon the reviews as listed below, I will expand on them to say that even with the lastest firmware the issues till exist and Garmin cannot get it fixed.  The hardware radio section is also pitiful and is out of deviation.  But probably the worst part of it all is that after five total sets sent to me from customer service as well as 5 sets returned for various firmware and hardware issues.  Garmin cannot seem to get the quality control correct.  Worse than that is a set that was supposedly CHECKED by a service tech and listed in the report as OPERATIONAL withing spec.  Out of the box was failing....that is terrible customer service and technical help.  I love the idea of the Garmin 530 and would buy two more in a second * IF * they correct all the known bugs and issues with the product.  I do not belive they can and or will and Garmin appears to be in denial about this product.  Stay away from this item until you hear that they have taken the bull by the horns and corrected this product 
 When you have lost weight, it's a very natural thing for others to be curious about how you lost your weight and kept it off. Whenever they have heard me tell my story, read my blog or book, or found out that I did it on the low-carb lifestyle, one question invariably has come up from time to time:   "What do you think about this low-carb diet where you can eat whatever you want for one-hour per day?"  My initial reaction to these people was usually something along the lines of this:  "That's absolutely crazy! There's no way you could ever lose weight and keep it off using this method."  I did the Atkins diet and honestly have not stayed on top of all the bazillion other low-carb diets out there. But there was something very odd about this plan that it made me look around to find out more about it.  Little did I know there was an actual book out there about this very diet so many people had been telling me about. It's called The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and it was written by a husband/wife team Drs. Richard and Rachael Heller.  The CAD diet, as it is referred to, makes the claim (and I agree with it) that many people are addicted to carbohydrates and need to be weaned off from depending on them for sustenance. Just like a drug addict gets small concentrated doses of their preferred drug daily so they can eventually get by with less and less, that same concept is what goes into the CAD diet.  If people think the Atkins diet is restrictive, then check out what you have to do on the CAD diet:  BREAKFAST: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat. LUNCH: ZERO-carb meal consisting of protein and fat.  You are NOT allowed to eat any bread, fruit, milk, juice, and most starchy vegetables. Absolutely NO snacking whatsoever except for black coffee or diet soda. You cannot use artificial sweeteners either.  Sound appealing, anyone? Hmmm? I suppose if that's all there was to this diet, then NOBODY would do it. But there is one more key aspect of the CAD diet that you probably will be interested in.   DINNER: Eat equal amounts of protein, vegetables and dessert of whatever you want to eat in whatever amount, but it must be eaten in a one-hour time frame. You can even enjoy a beer or glass of wine with your "reward" meal.  How's that for incentive? You basically starve all day long just so you can get to those sixty minutes at the end of your day where you can say hello to the buffet line! Who wouldn't enjoy a diet that lets you do THAT?!  Well, I'm still very skeptical about any lifestyle change that encourages you to eat the very foods that got you overweight or obese to begin with on a DAILY basis. I caught a lot of flack from my fellow low-carbers about my controversial "planned splurge" meal every 6-8 weeks during my weight loss. However, the Hellers give you a DAILY planned splurge!!! What's up with that?  We can blame this on Dr. Rachael, who stumbled upon this way of eating when she weighed 268 pounds after being on diet after diet. She became a psychologist to learn more about why people overeat (ostensibly to help herself in the process, too). She had skipped breakfast and lunch on a particular day she was fasting for a blood test and then, like most of us would, ate to her heart's content whatever she wanted for supper. The next morning she noticed she had dropped 2 pounds.  Thinking something must have gone wrong with her scale, she tried it again the next day, skipping breakfast and lunch and then eating a gargantuan dinner and once again, she lost another pound. She played around with what would eventually become The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet and went on to lose 150 pounds which she has kept off to this day.  The frequency of eating carbohydrates is the key behind the CAD diet. The Hellers believe that anyone who consumes ANY amount of carbohydrates during the day will set off all the bells and whistles in your body that you are hungry faster than if you avoided them altogether. They say that eating carbs throughout the day is like giving lots of small doses of cocaine to a cocaine addict. It will make them crave their poison even more!  That's why you basically avoid eating carbs on the CAD diet until the end of the day. This process of getting over carbohydrate addiction is a tricky one, and the Hellers think they have found a solid plan for making it work for lasting weight loss in people.  I still can't get around the fact that you don't change the poor eating habits of the people who have packed on the pounds. Sure, they basically starve themselves throughout the day before they eat their one BIG meal each day, but how is that stimulating the metabolism and preventing the biggest obstacle to weight loss success -- HUNGER!  There's no way I could do the CAD diet because I enjoy eating every 2-3 hours to keep my digestive process constantly in motion. I truly believe this is one of the things that has helped me lose the weight and keep it off. Since you cannot snack or use artificial sweeteners on the CAD diet, it would literally drive me insane even if there was that "reward" meal at the end of the day!  Wanna take a test to see if you are a carb addict? Click here to take the 10-question Carbohydrate Addict's Test. I scored a 2, which means "You do not appear to be carbohydrate addicted." No kidding, ya think?  Dr. Jonny Bowden, author of Living The Low-Carb Life, examined the CAD diet and said the diet uses some fuzzy science to make their points about why their plan works.  "While it seems pretty clear that there are both insulin and serotonin abnormalities in the obese, it's not at all clear that high levels of insulin depress levels of serotonin, as the Hellers hypothesize--in fact, the majority of the evidence points to the opposite response."  Furthermore, Dr. Bowden said he is concerned about the lack of attention on exercise as part of their weight loss program, stating "it's vital to both maintaining weight and to raising the metabolic rate."  While The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet has worked for a lot of people and I always tell people to do what works for them to lose weight and keep it off, I still have my reservations about this program. I think I'll pass on carb-loading my body for one hour a day 
 I've got this meter a month ago. I intended to use it to measure my pulse during exercise, but I've never been able to do so! At rest, the meter gives a reading after several attempts, but often inaccurate. You have to stay still as a statue for 10-20 seconds to get a reading. Now I'm using it as an exercise watch/stopwatch 
 The musical is charming, but this recording of the musical is awful.  In fact, it is the worst recording of anything I have ever heard.  It sounds like one microphone was used to record the CD live on stage, so that the singers sound louder or softer depending on where they were standing on stage.  Not only does this lead to awful sounding duets, but even soloists sound at times like they are 100 feet from the microphone.  Avoid this recording like the plague 
 Boy, this is way too much to pay for a hood on this lens.  It's a great a lens, but this is hardly worth the price 
 I enjoy reading The Years Best Fantasy & Horror but this is the first time I have ever been bored to death and pleased by my decision to borrow it from my public library. Generally the stories consist of great writing and really encourage you to seek out additional work by many of the authors featured. This collection consists of very weak and quite appallingly bad stories the worst being "Old Virginia". Many of the stories appeared in other anthology collections and it seems that the editors have chosen some of the worst works from them. "The Dark" had some great and generally creepy stories but instead of choosing any number of those they selected the story by Kelly Link which was god-awful, too long and quite confusing. I'm not sure if the departure of Ms. Windling has contributed to the general laziness of this volume but if so, please bring her back 
 While I purchased the CD for the title song, I was a little disappointed in the rest of the CD. I guess I didn't know the group's repertoire as well as I thought 
 I read a brief review of this book in the NYT Book Review and it sounded exciting and enlightening . . . alas, it's quite dull and offers surprisingly little information whether or not you're a butterfly fancier. To tell the truth, I read the second half of the book just to find out what in the world she could possibly fill all those pages with! There are a few neat facts about monarchs, and intriguing portraits of a few eccentric lepidopterists, but the rest is statements like "we really don't know [fill in blank] about these butterflies" and vague, unsatifying rhapsodizing by the author about her seemingly inexplicable passion for winged creatures--not to mention rather unremarkable mutterings about the nature of passion itself. This type of nonfiction can really sing--"The Orchid Thief," for example, though it definitely has its flaws, is nevertheless a fascinating read. Diane Ackerman's "Natural History of the Senses" is totally engaging as well. Or on a slightly different note, Judith Hooper's "Of Moths and Men" is a riveting portrayal of the controversy and scientific backbiting surrounding the peppered moth and Darwin's theory of natural selection. Contemporary nonfiction has come a long way, but "Four Wings" just falls flat. 
 We should all be for Mr. Ravi Batri.  By selling enough copies of this book and its sequel ("Surviving the Great Depression of 1990"), he singlehandedly prevented worldwide economic collapse 
 I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room. 
 This looked to be a very cool item but what we thought was a miniature picture of the item turned out to be the item itself.  How they expect you to enjoy a movie on a screen the size of a thumbnail is beyond me.  Fun idea to be able to carry this in your pocket but not worth it 
 Thre are some interesting anecdotes in this book about groups of people sharing (or not) their knowledge, skills and attitudes.  By and large case studies throw up something interesting, and I think the auhors have got it right there.  However where the book fell down for me was in its lack of attention to political analyses.  In essence the book tries to fathom the activities of human groups relative 'knowledge' production without dealing with power ideologies. Consequently, much of it is politically anodyne.  Following the fallacy that technology is neutral the book implies that knowledge has a political neutrality as well. To get the commumities of practice working effectively all one has to do is 'nuture' them and identify 'barriers' for removal. I found little content her but a lot of cotton wool.  There seems to be a general trend at the moment which insists on treating knowledge as 'business intelligence' without really grasping the epistemological problems endemic in talk of 'knowledge'.  It is just not subtle enough for my taste 
 Beckham is one of the great soccer players of today and I was really looking forward to his hints on how to do things, especially since this is a 2 DVD package.  I was most interested in the "banana kick" which is how most people call the kick that bends the ball around say an opposing "wall."  Not here.  Almost nothing is here except a lot of special effects, and "extras" like some shots of the face of the Great One looking worried as he gets ready to do a penalty kick.  There is a little 20 minutes or so of a game of the Great One vs a bunch of young kids but nothing to learn there.    The only saving grace of this is the points on "first touch" which are pretty good.  There are a very few pointers for beginners on how to get past an opponent but nothing any 9 year old can't figure out for him/herself.  So much sizzle, so little steak 
 This movie deserves no stars, but the two stars are for the hilarious story, silly acting and especially the extremely bad direction. If you watch it as a joke you'll have a good time laughing. This is not a western but a comedy. The best laugh is towards the end when the injured sheriff (Dennis Weaver) asks an old couple for help then faints 
 This was recorded shortly before the release of Schenker's second solo album. That points up the two things wrong with this: the band sounds tentative, like they're not comfortable with the new material, and the setlist is drawn almost entirely from those first two albums. That leads to some questionable choices: it opens with the big, inspiring "Ride of the Valkyries" music (uh, that's "Kill the Wabbit", if you don't recognize the name), and then the band comes in with a big, exciting, crashing chord, and you're just dying to hear them tear into "Captain Nemo", and it's an extreme letdown to hear "Armed and Ready" instead. Another odd choice is the piano ballad "Never Trust a Stranger", which surprisingly works very well live, and fits in well with the rest of the tunes because everything is played s-l-o-w.  On the other hand, Schenker himself is great, so how bad can it be? And there are a couple of songs here which you won't hear in live versions anywhere else 
 Pity the student using this textbook for a Differential Equations course. The Boyce & DiPrima text is unduly cumbersome with lacking explanation and poorly choosen examples throughout.   Many problems given in the text are tedious, and are indicated as being "technologically intensive." This is fine: in today's workplace, one can anticipate using a computer to solve problems. Unfortunately, none of my math professors will let me bring out my laptop on an exam. In some of the chapters, almost every problem is indicated as being "technologically intensive." If the computer-oriented problems weren't bad enough, the examples in the text are. Most of these are sorely unclear. I think that Boyce & DiPrima must have been writing in Fermat's marginal notes style when composing this text. Many times the omitted steps (which the authors sometimes regard as "it is clear that") require substantial algebraic and calculus manipulation to achieve the indicated results. Certainly I have no qualms about a text leaving out algebraic or even trigonometric simplifications, but what's left out of the Boyce & DiPrima examples is truely excessive. Worse, still, the examples are often very generic to a single type of problem. Thus, while one type of problem in the exercises might have good examples to instruct students on how to achieve solutions, the rest of the exercises often lack example altogether. Explanation and orientation to applied math is poor. The authors jump suddenly from a confusing theory discourse to an application without bridging the two. Many times I was left puzzled by how the text was proceeding. Still many more times I set the book aside in frustration.  This book does, however, have redeeming values. I like how all of the problems have their solutions provided in the back. If only other math textbook authors took the hint: students won't know how well they're doing if they cannot confirm their results! Also, the included software is good. I found it easy to use and helpful for the computing problems. I wish, however, more attention was given to this software in the text (like small projects using the software with each chapter). These benefits unfortunately do not overcome the tremendous flaws with the Boyce & DiPrima text.  Overall, this is one of the worst math books I have encountered. Rife with poor explanation, a confusing style, and poor exercise sets, the Boyce and DiPrima textbook is bound to cause grief for most students. The student's solution manual is helpful, but offers only little more explanation than the textbook. If you are hapless enough to have this text as a course requirement, I recommend that you either swap classes to try and get a course with a different book - or - be prepared to spend many long hours with tutors or your professor.  Good luck.  [... 
 As an adult fan of the Harry Potter series, I am fascinated by Ms. Rowling and her talent as a writer which brought this magical world to life.  When I purchased 'Muggles and Magic,' I looked forward to reading more about the author and the pop culture surrounding this phenomenon.  After reading Beahm's publication, I have to say that I'm disappointed.  Essentially, this book is a collection of articles highlighting Harry Potter/J.K. Rowling facts that have been featured elsewhere. (I.e. newspapers, magazines, online, etc.)  While some of the articles have good information about Rowling, there were times where reading them made me feel uncomfortable.  I wondered how Ms. Rowling, a famously private person who is not afraid to speak up to defend her character, would feel about the clippings that delve into her painful past.  She makes a point to dissuade such stories on her personal Web page, and reading them in this "fan" book seemed more like reading gossip than fact.  Other articles in the book simply have fraudulent and outdated information that Beahm hasn't bothered to research and update, such as that Dan Radcliffe has bowed out of all of the films after 'Goblet of Fire' (he hasn't, and is telling the press he's signed on for 'Order of the Phoenix'), and that J.K. Rowling's Web site doesn't feature a F.A.Q. (it does, here: http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/faq.cfm).  Another problem I had with this book was the higgledy-piggledy way it seems to have been put together.  There's no real rhyme or reason to the selections, and the collection doesn't flow but rather jerks, such as  from an article about owning owls as pets to another about Joanne's involvement in a cancer charity.  Beahm is clearly a fan and I can tell he had fun putting this little book of Potter/Rowling odds and ends together.  Had a little more research been done and a bit more time spent on fashioning the information together, this would be a fleshed-out companion worthy of the world of Harry Potter 
 I picked this book out of desperation for something to entertain me while on vacation.  The book did not grab my attention at first, but at least the premise sounded plausible.  However, as the plot unfolded, it grew more outlandish by the page.  Mr. Rollins clearly does not have a good grasp of technology and science and therefore should refrain from writing about those topics. He is no Michael Crichton.  He falls back on the lazy plot device of a supercomputer with artificial intelligence to fill gaps in his story.  It is so convenient to ask the computer to do any task or find any information much like snapping your fingers or rubbing Aladdin's lamp.  The climax was just plain dumb and made me angry.  Skip this stinker 
 The first paragraph of this book is one of the greatest in literary history. It's enough to compel the reader to read the next one hundred pages. Unfortunately, the book becomes one of the most overrated in history.   Many of the praises given say the book is difficult, confusing, and yet they come to the conclusion it is a great book. Why? Why not just say that difficult and confusing books are not very good. This is a parable with many characters, magic realism (a genre that deserves to be ignored, though that's another discussion), and the intertwining of lives, but they just don't move. The story only makes the reader wonder what the big fuss is all about?   Marquez' book about Miguel Litton, and News of a Kidnapping are much better, but this book just bores and bores.   
 Not the highpoint of her career, I'll say that. Yeah, the title track is a great bit of 90's Hi-NRG techno. Catchy stuff. If you just want that track, buy the single and see if you can get some remixes of it too.  Sadly, this thing is an album. Albums are inhently prolonged affairs, and here, Madonna seems bent on putting forward a set of songs that ramble on for far longer than they should. I mean, none of these 13 songs are shorter than 4:10!!! Most tracks begin as a snoozy collage of synthesized dwaddling, with the eventual trip-hop beat sneaking up and suffocating the track with monotony. Some might have some uber-fast dancefloor throbbing, but a bout of four on the floor repetition does nothing to decrease monotony.  If you ever needed an excuse to hate 90s techno, well, listen to this album. Then again, listening to any 90s techno will automatically induce human beings to vomit in order to purge their systems of that foul guff. Ugh...  Highlights include: "Ray of Light," and that's about it.  I'd suggest that you buy The Immaculate Collection and then pick few select singles ("Ray of Light," "Music," "Beautiful Stranger" and "Hung Up"). That's pretty much all the Madonna you'll ever need 
 A few assertions from this book: -men only love a woman for 42 months -you are always doing what is best for the species -you stop feeling revenge when you retaliate -only women feel infatuation and heartbreak -Rich children rarely feel pride -Maternal love lasts 33 months  If that doesn't sound incredibly ridiculous, this may be the book for you!  If you are interested in reading some real cutting-edge scientific thinking on emotions, Marvin Minsky's "The Emotion Machine" (0743276639) is outstanding 
 I got the hang on the 21% and all they could tell me at tech support is to shut down extra services. Well the only services I had running was the security services (firewall and antivirus). As an experiment I tried loading it on two computers set up identically. On one I shut down the antivirus and on the other I shut down the firewall. Neither would install. So I shut down both on both computers and it installed perfectly on both. I cant believe that they want you to shut down security in order to install. Makes me wonder.."What are they hiding that they dont want me to know about". I checked adaware and a registry cleaner and even ran my AV again and found nothing but still... It makes you wonder. Also the layout is very poor, so buggy they have many, MANY patches and updates. Will not print forms correctly and want to charge you fees to e-file when it is free from the governments. They just want more money.   In my opinion...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAP. BY THE TIME YOU WASTE YOUR MONEY ON GETTING THIS TO WORK, YOU CAN GET A PROFESSIONAL TO DO IT FOR YOU FOR LESS 
 considering the talents of Both Eddie Levert&Gerald Levert this set is very middle of the road.the vocals are good but the music is for the most part run of the mill 
 A rather sophmoric collection of sub-standard vampire stories save the the fantastic tale of horror from the pen of unknown Joanne Dahme. This newcomer is sure to take a place next to the gothic Anne Rice in undead  literature 
 I got this book from a well meaning spouse for Christmas 2005.  I have been a Parrot Head for the last 7 years.  I did not like this book.  The only part of this book that I found worth reading was the part after each album's review, the author wrote a few paragraphs about what was going on in Jimmy's life or with the record companies at the time that the album was recorded and released.  I found the historical background interesting.  The second part of the book was devoted to reviewing the books that Jimmy has written.  The reviews were way to long and to me, seem self serving.  Other than that, not worth your time.  
 Total Control started really-really well for this reader (nice premise/set-up). It had an even more compelling middle (who? who is the bad guy??). The last third of the book imploded as I was pleading for lead character Sydney to get "done in" by the bad guys for being so utterly stupid and annoying. Nothing in this book added up well as it concluded. Baldacci let me down on this one 
 I was hoping, without going to a bookstore and completely looking through it, that this would be a benficial book for my 13 year old.  Instead it put her in tears.  Instead of accepting themselves as who they are and how they look, they bring kids to the conclusion that they cannot be OK if they break out.  My daughter was very upset and all I could do was apologize.  If you are looking for a book that wants to compress your daughter into the current fashions and mainstream, maybe this is for you, then again, I strongly believe that my daughter is special and that this has not helped her self-confidence or her understanding of all the changes happening.  Personally, I do not want my daughter caught up in all of the latest makeup and dress, I want her to be able to wear what she is comfortable in and feel comfortable in her own skin.  Next time I will review any books I get for her much closer 
 Let's face it folks this is not a rock album that everyone believes it is. I will start by saying I didn't play the 30 second snippet for "All I Want To Do" because I knew it was already a lost cause, the rest were all just as bad. There are only 2 songs that may be a little bit o.k. and they are "Can't Cry Anymore", and "We Do What We Can". I just feel that this was a pop album all the way even though it has a rock edge don't be decieved. I don't know what she's like, or anything like that, but I do know she's beautiful, but while talented it's not the music I seek to listen to. 
 The art of writing and negotiation has come a long way since the ole Herb wrote this book. His stories present him as an argumentative, cheap, old-fashioned man with a distant relationship with his wife.  His first kibble of advice is to annoy a salesperson at a one-price store (read as "department store") until they eventually agree to knock a few bucks off the price. I guess this supposed millionaires time is not that expensive 
 From one review:  "The addition of chlorine, a known poison is one of the most unpalatable aspects of this sweetener opines Dr. Hull. Pointing out differences between chlorine occurring naturally with the man made version in sucralose, she leaves no stone unturned in explaining the potential harmful effects of ingesting a compound containing man made chlorine."  There's no such thing as "man-made" chlorine. Chlorine is an element.   From another review: "Splenda is chlorine-based, the same as the basis of DDT."  Picture, if you will, two highly dangerous substances: first, the metallic element sodium, so violently reactive it ignites when exposed to air. The second: chlorine, a deadly gas. Put the two together, add a little energy, and POOF! What do you get? Sodium chloride, or common table salt, not only not poisonous, but a necessity of life.  Hull's argument that Splenda is unsafe because of its reliance on chlorine betrays a lack of understanding of high school chemistry. However, this isn't surprising: "Dr." Hull obtained her "Doctorate" from "Clayton College Of Natural Health", a distance learning college that is only accredited by, in their website's own words, "the American Association of Drugless Practitioners and the American Naturopathic Medical Accreditation Board. These are private, professional associations that offer accreditation in naturopathy and other areas of natural health. Both are private accrediting associations designed to meet the needs of non-traditional education and are not affiliated with any government agency." In short, it's not recognized by any educational accreditation organization. The only "Doctor of Nutrition" program they offer is "Doctor of Philosophy in Holistic Nutrition", whose courses include such titles as "Cancer: Prevention and Politics" and "Nutritional Healing: Ayurvedic Perspectives", with the only chemistry involved "Chemistry Fundamentals". I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if her Masters, if not her Bachelor degree too, came from this outfit. Ironically, the web site for her aspartame book claims "Dr. Janet Hull's aspartame expertise is based on her professional background." Well, that's enough reason not to read the book right there. I should also mention that this "college" teaches courses in "iridology", the claim that the state of health of an individual can be determined by the patterns of their iris. It is also "accredited" by an iridology association. To quote from Wikipedia: "It has been pointed that the premise of iridology is at odds with the notion that the iris does not undergo changes in an individual's life. Iris texture is a phenotypical feature which develops during gestation and remains unchanged since birth. There is no evidence for changes in the iris pattern other than variations in pigmentation in the first year of life, eventual freckles and variations caused by glaucoma treatment. This stability of iris structures is at the foundation of iris recognition for identification purposes.... Scientific research into iridology has shown mostly, but not entirely, negative results. However, all double blinded, rigorous tests of iridology have failed to find any statistical significance to iridology.... In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association... three iridologists incorrectly identified kidney disease in photographs of irises and often disagreed with each other. The researchers concluded: 'iridology was neither selective nor specific, and the likelihood of correct detection was statistically no better than chance.'" In other words, "Dr." Hull's "college" is accredited by, and teaches the beliefs of, quacks.  For the reviewer who couldn't figure out whether she was a firefighter or a doctor, according to her official bio she's both. And so much more: " She holds a Doctorate in Nutrition, a Master's Degree in Environmental Science, is an international geographer and geologist, a former university professor, firefighter and Hazardous Waste Specialist and Emergency Responder.  She is a Licensed Certified Nutritionist, certified fitness professional, author and aspartame victim."   Folks, I would recommend taking this information along with that of several other reviewers' (short book, half of it recycling material on aspartame from her last book, etc) and decide to spend your money elsewhere. There are other books written by competent, qualified researchers with bona fide credentials that document the health effects of aspartame. And it would seem that the only one warning about Splenda would be "Dr." Hull, at least for now (although, unlike aspartame, a lot of positive research exists on Splenda). And don't forget to laugh the next time someone tells you to avoid Splenda because it "has chlorine it it" (I've seen one other unqualifed website make that argument). The chlorine is a part of the sucralose molecule, just as it is in table salt, and it's the chemical properties of the molecule that is the question.    
 The time travel issue(a wierd thing about a box getting smaller) is better solved in the movie. And that thing about Lady Claire?? I can't believe that an intelligent woman could only get by in those times by literally becoming a prostitute 
 I gave it two stars because while I didn't hate it, it was dull and predictable.  I see beter plots on TV's Starsky and Hutch.  It probably wouldn't have been so bad if I didn't have to use subtitles; I found myself more interested in looking at the text than watching the movie.  I know, that's only my opinion, but I watch a lot of DVD's and I think I know what I like and don't like 
 I was so excited when I ordered my Star Wars Holographic Emperor figure. I'd been waiting for this exclusive figure be available for weeks!! When I got home today, the box with the Amazon logo was on my doorstep. Upon opening the box, I was completely disappointed to find that the Emperor figure I'd been waiting for was damaged since it was jammed into the box so that the backing card was crushed. The people packing this stuff are half-wits!! Anybody with a brain would know better than to  cram something into a box like that!! They should be ashamed of their service & to all you collectors out there....BEWARE!! 
 I will keep this short. The only necessary chapter to read is on the Zahal. the IDF. Much of the book depends on silly, childish praise for the realistically superior Israeli Force. So much so that it makes for pedantic reading. I do not recommend. 
 I've read (or tried to read) this book three times over the course of several months.  I am displeased on several levels.  I want to let people know other books are far better.    Lousy formatting and lack of grammar lead me to determine this book has been published by novices.  I would not be so upset, except the content is questionable too, not just the format.  At best, this book is NOT a reference work (because it is SO hard to follow a train of thought).  I wonder about the other publications of Two Plus Two Publishing?     Advanced poker advice given here is for folks NOT interested in statistics or numbers.  I feel obligated to inform readers that Sklansky's "Hand Groupings" are arbitrary--they have nothing to do with statistical chances of winning.   The most irritating aspect of this book is the constant advertisement for other Sklansky books.  Comments like, "For those of you who are interested in the rationale behind these rankings, see HOLD EM POKER by David Sklansky" (Sklansky 2005:17) reinforce my money was NOT well-spent in buying this book 
 Just for everyone's information -- and my own ego -- although I am listed as the author of both the first and second editions of this book, and I did write the first edition, the second edition was produced without my participation. I take NO responsibility for the second edition. I am currently updating the book, and a third edition, written in the style of the first edition, will be available soon.  Jo Lynn Southar 
 Paul Auster's City of Glass is perhaps the worst read I've experienced.  The story moves at a pace that would make a snail envious; the murder mystery plot is as thin as air and hardly resolves itself; we spend way too many waking hours with the main character sulking around his apartment staring into a toilet bowl in which he has just defficated--I kid you not.  The best part of this novel is the end.  I read with fervor to get to the end in hopes that the author would have the talent to tie everything together and make this experience somewhat valid; however, I was utterly and discustingly dissapointed beyond my wildest dreams.  To all the reviewers and critics who claim this book is a metaphysical, existential tour de-force, I beg wholeheartedly with my very life to differ.  I believe the author had no such thoughts in mind, had no direction when writing this disgrace of a work and it saddens me to see such an unentertaining, dry-dry-dry piece of fiction with one or two not-so-clever plot devices, gather such literary praise.  Like a Rorschach image you can see life, love, death, a myriad of wonderful symbols, and if you would like to believe that the person who put that ink blot on the page intended you to see all of that depth, intepret and dwell in that depth--coming to conclusions and reflecting ultimately on your own life, well, then, good for you.  But in reality, the person that made that Rorschach for you is Auster, and he just ambigoulsy splatted some ink on the novel pages before you with no ryhme or reason and you All bought it...hook line and sinker. This novel is an exercise in an authors ability to take us nowhere, show us little on the way and still receive praise, despite an ending which is refelctive of the entire work, in that it plain and simply: sucks 
 In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process "domestication" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.  While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.  According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).  The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, "domesticated" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.    One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God."  He uses it to epitomize the use of "word" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says "The word was made flesh and dwelt among us".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather "Jesus Christ".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that "sin begins with rejection of yourself" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6 that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.  In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz "you are dealing with yourself, not me" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.   According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was "trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.  Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.  In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.    While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations. 
 She cheated on homework!She could have written her weekend on her paper.Instead,she took May's homework.What an Idiot!!!!!!!!She took Herb's spelling test and.....got in trouble.Then,Mr. Scary is on the next word and says,"Peek.I saw you peek.Peek."Junie b. sits in her seat very still and gulps.She is not a good listener.She even got yelled at and got a spanking.I hate this 
 I'll be sincere.I didn't read all this trash-book.Someone lent this trash-book to me, some years ago, here in Brazil.This book is so bad, that I didn't finished it.In fact, I read less than 10% of this biblical-garbage. This was a best-seller some years ago, in many parts of the world, including Brazil and USA. Today the best seller is Da Vinci Code.A trash-book so absurd, as this trash-book. Every time has its own trash-best-seller. About a century ago eugenics was fashion.Later came communism, fascism, nazism, ufologism, etc. This bibliolatry is a good book only for morons or atheists.If you are an atheist, this trash-book is a good way to debunk the bible. 
 I just completed the book, and wish I'd read the reviews from readers sooner. The errors definitely distracted from the overall experience. Unlike many of the reviewers, I purchased the book prior to a vacation to Arizona, thinking it might give me an insight into the history and flavour of the American Southwest. That it did - but to see the relationship between Dine/Navajo linked to Athapaskan-speaking people in Canada's north who fished for salmon and built totem poles .. 'Scuse me? The author mixed up the Pacific Northwest's Haida people with the inland Dene. In the chapter named 'Tombstone', the author mistakenly names Val Kilmer as an actor portraying Wyatt Earp; wrong again, Kilmer played Doc Holliday and Kurt Russell played Earp in the movie referred to. And these are just a couple of the more irritating and obvious mistakes.  It's too bad, as the material is fascinating. However, I soon began to mistrust the information 
 There were a few interesting nuggets of information in this book, but there were miles of reading between them.  The first part of the book is an exercize of retelling you how great this book is going to be and how it will change your business life.  The rest of the book is a smattering of pedestrian marketing information repackaged to sound like astonishing breakthroughs in thinking.  Yes, I understand the components of selling three ways.  Yes, I get it.  What a waste of time and money 
 My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day.  I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy.  The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places.  The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit.  I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy.  I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better.  Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality.  
 This movie should be zero and a half stars, but since the rating doesn't go that low, we're going to have to go with one star. This movie was copying off James Bond, and got boring after a while. Not a good movie 
 Just not that impressed with this book.  The write-up was much better than the book itself.  Superficial.  Will be selling my copy as used 
 I was also disappointed that the product came without a DVD, though the initial description said so. But Amazon has given me the refund of the whole purchase price. Appreciate their gesture.   Agree with previous reviewer that the pump is really hard to work with. It took a *lot* of time to get the ball inflated and the pump got hot meanwhile.  Yeah, not very happy with this product.  p.s: Contrastingly, had a bad experience with Dell on a similar situation when I bought a Nikon camera. Dell blamed the wrong description on Nikon and expectedly, Nikon blamed Dell. Neither owned up the error. But Amazon was pretty good. I really appreciate it 
 After close examination of this text, I conclude that from a Chinese/western medical perspective that this book is an attempt to make pseudoscience look convincing in order to support the marketing campaign of the authors. From a position of Chinese medicine and medical physiology expertise, they have failed.  Energy therapy is based largely on false assumptions about the brain. It uses a "thought field" approach as the main background theory. However, thought fields do not exist. The book explains energy as in positive or negative terms. However there are no physical similarities or correlates between normal energy and thought energy. Any physics scholar will know that energy does not work that way. There are know known physical correlates with new age notions of thought energy. The book makes feeble attempts to argue for the existence of these spurious and non recordable energy fields.  It steers clear of paranormal claims that are usually associated with energy medicine, but it is still pseudoscience  Qi is more accurately conceptualized as a philosophy, not a science, and its physical existence is not empirically supported. The book is completely unconvincing in arguing otherwise. In addition, they note that while acupuncture, a procedure used to correct the flow of chi, has been shown to provide some minor analgesic effects, its utility has not been demonstrated for treating illnesses or diseases. Chinese medicine uses a combination of treatments that work together.  The authors' proposed mechanisms of action are all spurious pseudoscience. There are simpler far more plausible reasons that may explain the few cases of success with the energy therapies techniques. These include placebo effects resulting from the mere expectation for improvement, demand characteristics, therapist enthusiasm and support, therapist-client alliance, and effort justification (i.e., the tendency to report positive changes in order to justify the effort exerted), and psychological manipulations such as distraction, suggestion, acceptance, and dissociation. These reasons are dismissed by the author, in preference for erroneous notions about meridians, thought energy, and the flow of Qi. The authors even claim that when the techniques fail it is because a negative person has "undone" them.  Considering that these techniques may potentially distract the patient's attention away from a serious illness such as cancer, and that the energy therapists in general do not cater for this eventuality, sensible consumers need to think more than twice before embarking on this pseudoscientific treatment. The book may convince you to open your mind for a while. However, please do not be so open minded that your brain falls out.  Regards Dr Le 
 I can't speak with authority about other deseg cases, but I AM knowledgeable about the St. Louis case, having spent four years on the St. Louis Board of Education (1989 - 1993.).  Simply put, deseg has destroyed the St. Louis Public Schools (SLPSs), which were arguably, the best large public school system in the nation prior to deseg, when they were segregated and run by white Lutherans.  Today, after 26 years of deseg, the SLPSs are probably no more than one year from losing their state accreditation and being taken over by the state of Missouri. Let's consider some facts rather than the disinformation of dilettantes and poseurs such as Kozol:   COSTS  Deseg has cost the State of Missouri about $8 Billion between the Kansas City and St. Louis cases. The bill in K.C. totaled about $3.5 Billion when it finally ended, while the St. Louis case has almost certainly passed the $4 Billion mark. (These statistics are scrupulously hidden by the leftist news media.) What have we realized from this expenditure?  First of all, state money diverted to these two deseg cases was stolen from every school district in Missouri not participating in a deseg case. Small, rural school districts routinely spend between $4,000 and $5,500 per pupil each year. In St. Louis, the per-pupil expenditure has been as high as $11,711: Yet, those rural, so-called "out-state" districts do a far better job of educating and graduating students, despite having half the resources. (I'm sure in Kozol's mind they are merely "goyim," and deserve no better...)  Ironically, while less affluent "out-state" districts were robbed of state funding by deseg, the wealthier school districts in St. Louis County experienced a massive WINDFALL from deseg: Since they are reimbursed by the state the AVERAGE per-pupil cost for each city transfer, (rather than their "marginal" cost,) wealthy districts such as Clayton, Ladue and Parkway benefited from a massive infusion of new revenues, although these school districts have traditionally out-spent almost every other Missouri district by a factor of three or more. (For example, Clayton currently spends about $15,000 per pupil per year.)   ACHIEVEMENT  In the SLPSs, half the students test at the 20th percentile or lower on nationally standardized tests. This stat would be even worse, except that (I am told) the "LD" (or "learning disabled") kids do not take the standardized tests. There are legions of LD kids...  In a rare moment of wisdom and sobriety, a federal judge sitting on our deseg case ordered a test of its efficacy in the early 1990s. That study, called the "Lissitz Study" revealed that city students (i.e., black students) bused to predominately white county school districts improved less academically than did every other category of student in the SLPS. That is, they improved less than students in all-black, the "naturally"-integrated, and "magnet" schools.  When the Educational Testing Service still "normed" the SATs between 400 and 1600, the average SLPS student had a combined SAT of 760. Worse yet, these were the best and most motivated students, with further educational aspirations, who "self-selected" themselves to take the SATs and were therefore, a highly "skewed" sample relative to the average SLPS student.    Deseg is almost universally motivated by the laughable paradigm that, if we throw enough money at our inner-city schools, black kids will achieve at a level commensurate with white kids. Now that even William Coleman has repudiated his own research on this subject, ("The Coleman Report," cited in "Brown v. Board,") Kozol and deseg's other defenders could spend their time far more productively by studying the lessons of "The Bell Curve" in order to understand academic disparities between the races.  VESTED INTERESTS  It has been remarked that the defenders of deseg will never relent until the last white kid has been driven from the system. This is because the NAACP Legal Defense Fund is a "co-plaintiff" in most (if not ALL) U.S. deseg cases, and is periodically distributed "legal expenses" by the federal courts. These are a very important source of revenue to the NAACP, which has experienced declining membership and numerous financial scandals over the last several decades.  Similarly, deseg has meant a great deal more than the mindless expenditure of billions to bus students around. One of the most injurious elements of the St. Louis deseg plan has been a massive affirmative-action program for administrators and teachers. The SLPSs now employ more functionally illiterate individuals than the N.B.A., and have become nothing less than an employment agency for lazy and incompetent blacks with political connections.   Essentially, the same black women who, 30 or 40 years ago were employed in middle-class households as "domestic" help, are now SLPS teachers and administrators. ("I is a teacher.") How anyone who never really absorbed a high school education could be presumed able to teach mystifies all but Kozol and deseg's other defenders. If teachers and administrators in the SLPSs were required to take the S.A.T.s, more than half would test significantly below average: We know this because they have already demonstrated the fact!  Approximately half of all SLPS teachers and about 60% of its administrators attended Harris-Stowe State Teacher's College, which has the second lowest academic standards of any institution of "higher learning" in Missouri. Last time I called their admissions office, I was told that Harris-Stowe accepted applicants with a combined SAT of 780. It should come as no surprise that recent measures of SLPS student SATs do not differ significantly from those of many of their teachers.   HYPOCRISY  A truly fascinating phenomenon I have observed is that there seem to be few defenders of deseg among those whose kids actually participated in such a program. It doesn't take a parent long to understand that deseg isn't so wonderful when your kid gets rolled for his lunch money every day, or your daughter gets beaten up because she won't date outside her race.   Now Kozol may not have kids, but I'll just bet that if he does, they did not participate in any voluntary deseg programs, if any were available where he resides. (The Jews are mustard for this sort of thing, as long as they are merely allowed to posture and it doesn't actually cost them anything...)  I once had the rare opportunity to sit next to Dr. Susan Uchitelle, the  Jewish woman who headed the St. Louis Deseg's "Voluntary Inter-district Coordinating Council" throughout the 1980s and 1990s. (She was paid $60,000 per year, but from what I could discern, her sole responsibility seemed to be running interference with the news media, so the rubes out there wouldn't get the wrong idea about the joys and benefits of deseg whenever there was a stabbing, gun-shot incident, murder, or race riot.)  I considered it an "opportunity" because I was able to ask her a question that no one had ever had the impertinence to ask of her before: "Have any of your children participated in the voluntary transfer program?" (That is, were her kids, who would have been "poster children" for the county-to-city deseg program, allowed to transfer from their all-white county schools in order to be voluntarily bused to inner-city schools?)   What do you think was the answer, oh gentle reader? Your response to this question may have far-reaching implications for your understanding of the world around you and some varieties of its inhabitants, such as Jonathan Kozol...   (I'll give you a hint: Susan Uchitelle's attitude toward deseg is very much like Leona Helmsley's attitude toward taxes...)        
 This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out.  Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well. 
 PC hardware and software changes rapidly, and this book desperately needs updating. No discussions of Pentium 4 class systems and related current memory and operating system updates. Save your $. If you are ready to build, cuy the OReilly "PC Hardware in a Nutshell" book instead 
 I am a huge Janet Evanovich fan; this is not one of her better stories.  The book jacket summary sounded very interesting to me, it had real potential to be a lighthearted, intriguing romance.  The book started out decent enough, I immediately liked the main character, Cate, and fell for her and her crazy Irish family.  At the same time I was falling for the Madigan's I was introduced to a not so loveable character, Patrick Pugg.  This guy is so annoying it really takes away from the rest of the story.  I feel he was inserted into the story to garner some laughs; unfortunately he had the opposite effect on me.  He constantly refers to himself in the third person, everything is "Pugg this" and "Pugg that."  It was exhausting and exasperating to read!  He had absolutely zero redeeming qualities; any normal person would have sprayed this guy with mace and taken out a restraining order.  For you Plum fans, think of all the faults and quirks of the character Albert Kloughn, add a few more, than multiply and magnify by 100.    The rest of the characters were endearing and likeable.  Kellen McBride is a loveable hero and it's easy to see why he and Cate are so attracted to one another.  The whole mystery of the missing drag queen roommate and the other surprises (don't want to spoil anything) also had some potential, but ended up falling flat for me.  The ending and the wrap up of the mystery was completely unbelievable and ridiculous.  And just when I'd think it couldn't get any more far fetched, it would.   While I know this is fiction, and I appreciate the land of make believe, I always prefer a little reality in my books.  The humor and the dialogue seemed really forced and childish to me.  Nothing in this book made me laugh out loud, like I normally do with a Janet read, I barely smiled at some parts.  Another problem with this story was the introduction of yet another dog.  I was happy this one didn't resort to the normal dog antics, but the dog thing is getting a bit stale for me.  Not the worst book I have read, but far from the best. If you're dying to read this book, I recommend borrowing it from a friend or your local library.  
 I wanted so bad to love 'The Glow, Pt. 2' -- so many people I respect had such nice things to say about it.  And after more than a year of trying my hardest to like this record, listening to it at home, in the car, at work, up loud, down low, over headphones, in daylight, after dark, I have this to say: I just don't see what all the fuss is about.  When Phil Elvrum decides to put songs together, they're good -- the opening few tracks, especially "The Moon," are fantastic, expansive little slices of lo-fi psychedelia, the universe crammed into a 4-minute pop song.  But once those songs end, I'm left with 45 minutes of unfocused recording, almost ambient sounds.  When songs fragments do coalesce into something, it reminds me of a Neutral Milk Hotel recording, without the melody.  I think Phil's reaching for something unifying, trying to make this a monumental experience, not just another lo-fi pop record; but I can't see what it is he's afte 
 The concept of this film is downright brilliant--a maze of betrayal and corruption and kidnapping-gone-wrong...or did it? It's too bad that the script and/or the editing is so sloppy and choppy that I frequently found myself wincing at such poor filmmaking. The gratuitous sex might be a turn-on for some (it wasn't for me), but the only really worthwhile aspects of this movie are the idea itself and the actors, who have gifted this writer/director with far better performances than he deserves. If you're a fan of any of the actors, you might watch it if you have nothing better to do. Otherwise, skip it 
 A great looking book, which however fails to follow through by providing equally good content.  Too often specifics are passed over in favour of vague generalities 
 This watch was a disappointment; it has a huge dial, but the chronograph functions are extremely tiny.  It's also an extremely "flashy" watch - the image on the web-site makes it look classy - not so.  Additionally, the watch is completely useless under low light conditions - it neither fluoresces, nor does it have a light-up function.  Returned it after a week, got my money back 
 Regardless of your opinion of the album "Bat Out Of Hell 2: Back Into Hell",(I happened to enjoy it a lot!) this "Deluxe Edition" is ridiculous.  Most, if not all, of the tracks on the second CD have long been available on promotional singles.  These promo singles were produced in such large quantities that they found their way into used CD stores everywhere, never becoming rarities.  Most of these tracks aren't even remixes, but rather edits.  So, on this bonus CD, you don't get more, you get less of each track.  This is one of the most padded and useless "Deluxe" reissues that I've seen in some time.  There were rumours that this reissue was going to be cancelled, which would have made sense, but evidently they're going ahead with it.  If you have the original CD, save yourself the added expense of acquiring this little extra bit of fluff.  4 stars for the original album itself, 0 stars for the second CD, for an overall 2 stars 
 This book was on the New York Times non-fiction bestseller list for 17 weeks before that newspaper (April 1992) felt compelled to run a FRONT PAGE story explaining that "Chief Seattle" never spoke the words attributed to him in this book.  Only one kind of reader will care, those who love the truth.  Others (read Liberals and God-haters) will have no problem with this book, which is why it still sells well. Read all about this subterfuge in Reader's Digest July 1993, volume 143, issue 855 pages 100 to 104. 
 This movie is the most frightening film I've tried to watch with my [...] daughter. It is NOT suitable for very young children. I was rather horrified by just how creepy it is. The juxtaposition of the saccharine bears with the sadistic cruel scary "spirit" is truly bizarre and could;ve been created by someone who in fact HATES children. If you are not buying this movie due to your own nostalgic desire to relive the 80's, but to watch something sweet and cuddly with your sweet and cuddly children, be forewarned. This movie is not only bad, it's kinda 'bad'. Like, not in a good way. If children are not involved in the purchase- but you are reliving the 80's or getting some really weird gift for a friend, then, you know, maybe you'll dig it. I didn't 
 I love looking through baby name books, and, truth be told, I was running out of names for my Sims, so I picked this one up.  Although lengthy, the book gives you lists of names.  Never once did I see a definition or a reason why a certain name is popular.  I like unique names, but there are no prenunciation keys or anything helpful.    Just lists.  Famous names, names famous people used for their kids, unique middle names, and, of course, the most popular names.  There's a lot of overlapping--the list of most popular names in Canada and the US and the UK are devastatingly similar.  Even more disappointing is the part where they start listing popular names in other countries, and I flip the page to find the list of 100 in the US quickly dwindles through France and Ireland to not even five in Middle Eastern countries.  Just when this book starts getting interesting, they ruin it by forgetting the follow-through.  I would like to have seen a history on each name, reasons why they are popular, and a pronunciation key to help sound out difficult, unique names.  I finally ended up flipping through the index, picking out names for my Sims, then sending it back 
 Metallica from the very beggining had huge potential but never lived up to it. They made some ok songs along the way but never had an entire album that was worth anything. This album is the only one of them all that I think is ok. It's the only one I can listen to and really the only one that is ok all the way through. Still not a huge fan of the album but its the best they did. Overrated but not to bad. Plenty of other bands that are way better 
 Congratulations are in order to the authors of Mavericks of the Sky.  Barry Rosenberg and Catherine Macaulay managed to create a story, almost three hundred pages, about the beginnings of air mail in the United States that could have been all summed up in their thirty page epilogue.  Rosenberg and Macaulay, at first, seem to be well proven authors with many successful publications under their belts.  Both have published work for publications such as Aviation Week & Space Technology, E/The Environment Magazine, and the Daily Racing Forum.  It is important to remember that looks can be deceiving.   Webster's Dictionary defines Maverick as a person or individual that does not get along well with others.  It is quite odd that that Rosenberg and Macaulay would title their work and label the founding men of aviation and air mail as "Mavericks", but maybe the name was stolen from Top Gun.  The book basically sums up the stories of the early pioneers of aviation that led to the formation of air mail and the airlines as we know them today.  It is quite amazing that a topic of such interest could be told in such a confusing and unprofessional manner as Rosenberg and Macaulay demonstrated. 	Mavericks of the Sky begins with the ill famous story of Major Reuben Hollis Fleet, and his tedious role in the formation of the air mail service.  The book continues with the story of Major Fleet and introduces numerous amounts of characters that some how had a role in early air mail service.  The authors present a story that would be quite sufficient for the average 7th grader, but not for anyone who has the slightest inclination about the overwhelming amount of information that should be told about the pioneers of the air mail service.   Rosenberg and Macaulay are successful in telling the story of the air mail service as much like a comedy skit off of Saturday Night Live.  Both continually change from the tone of a scholarly author to that of one that seems to be writing an episode of Seinfeld.  It is easy to spot numerous examples throughout the book where both authors  display a carefree attitude in the telling of an incident, and the average reader loses the historical meaning of the incident, because they become caught up in a joke.  The authors may simply be meaning to poke harmlessly at the mishaps of these early pioneers, but it is suggested that they stick to a more serious attitude when discussing men who lost their lives day in and day out to further a dream.   The epilogue of this book was much more beneficial that reading the story itself.  Information was presented better and more organized than through the twenty something chapters in Mavericks of the Sky.  The epilogue simply shortened all the various stories presented throughout the book and got right to the point instead of a bunch of ad lib.   Rosenberg and Macaulay deserve much credit on the pictures contained in the book, because they give the book much more character.  It is easy to gain a lot of understanding of what early aviation was like by flipping through the pictures contained within this book, but it is sad that neither author can take credit for these pictures.  Pictures make a book very personnel and these deliver the wide array of attitudes presented by these  men and women just be looking into their eyes.   This book is a great recommendation for anyone interested in a quick read with little information.  Mavericks of the Sky, is very selective in the stories it tells about the formation and development of the air mail service in the United States.  If the reader desires to have a more detailed understanding of these pioneers and their stories, it is recommended that this book be passed up and one chosen by someone who actually can write a historical work of non-fiction! 	     
 I bought these as part of a package Amazon was offering with the Dymo Turbo 400 printer.  Totally useless unless you need a lot of return labels.  You are better off buying mailing labels.  That way you can print both your address and the person you are sending it to on the same label 
 i ordered this item 5 months ago was told by amazon that i would get this item and it was avaliable and then after 5 months they tell me that they cant get it and it is still avaliable on there web site as far as im concerned amazon is not worth shopping if they cant hold there promises and say it is avaliable please take this very seriously when ordering from amazon thank 
 ..and what's the point? All of these songs (minus a few) are on the anthology, along with countless others. The Beastie Boys didn't put this out, their record label did.  It's just way for corporate to make money. If you consider yourself a real Beastie Boys fan, that is you're interested in all the other music they made that wasn't put on radio, then don't buy this.  If you occasionally heard them on the radio and Fight For Your Right is your favorite song, then go ahead. The Beastie Boys are much more than just their greatest hits.  To fully appreciate them, you have to listen to an album all the way through. 
 Michael Mandel's book has laid an egg, but you can only understand why if you make the mistake of picking up this book and reading it. This same gent, who "predicted" the Internet depression (after it already happened) now seeks to burden us with the believe that all these hobgoblins out there are the "enemies of growth." But his arguments are unconvincing and poorly presented, in prose that is hackneyed and academic-dull 
 I thought this book would be chapter legnth stories by people who visited paris. Instead, it is more like a listing of places to stay, places to eat. There were some essays, most a page or two, but they were not helpful. One example of an essay was a professor from New York who wrote how the French are rude. Another 2 page essay was on "cheap places to eat", but the cheapest resturant was over $75.     I want to enjoy my trip, not start out finding things not to like. 
 I think the music is ok but boring. The musicianship IS decent, but the production sounds very humble and home done on a computer with cheap software. It's interesting to hear the covers one time. I value my listening time and guard it jealously. Who would waste an hour on this when you can be listening to the great Spanish Guitar Masters?  For guitar music that truly captures the heart I'd rather listen to the greats of Flamenco like Paco de Lucia or Manolo San Lucar's Tauromagia for example. This cd pales so horribly IN COMPARISON to the music of the Spanish Masters.  But of course if Rolling Stone says it's good than it must be 
 Saturday is catchy.  Roll Out is tolerable.  Area Codes is abysmal.  Now for content:  You can't talk about the content of Ludacris's music without talking about his contempt for women. I could at least respect Ludacris if he had respect for my gender. But he doesn't, therefore I can't have anything but contempt for him. Stop calling my sisters ho-es, and I'd stop calling you a m-o-r-o-n. It's simple. I don't see why Ludacris fans think women are just supposed to accept or IGNORE female oriented hate speech?  Ludacris is OBSESSED with sex and h-oes. It makes you wonder if he has hang-ups about it. Afterall, those who constantly brag about things are usually trying to OVERcompensate for a lacking somewhere else. Or maybe Ludacris saw his mother selling herself in a back alley for a dollar and it scarred his outlook on women forever. I guess if she had actually RAISED him and shown him how to respect women-- ALL women--then he probably could have grown up to be a respectable guy instead of the prurient dummy he is.   This guy makes me so sick to my stomach I root for Bill O'reilly to tear him a new a-hole.      I'll explain my views, I won't apologize for them 
 It's tempting to start this review by saying sociologists should stay away from musical topics, at least if they can't appreciate music, and I mean *appreciate* rather than "enjoy." But maybe a fairer criticism would be if you're going to upset the apple cart this much, you'd really better have a sturdier theory than Tina DeNora has here. DeNora is a sociologist at the University of Exeter, and she thinks Beethoven's genius was constructed by society. She says Beethoven's place in the musical firmament was a result of certain aspiring elite aristocrats of the time having a predilection for Beethoven's "difficult" music in an attempt at social one-upmanship and wanting to use him to advance their own standing in Vienna. To put it simply, Ludwig was at the right place at the right time, he had the luck. There is no analysis of the music itself in this book, because she has decided it is irrelevant. I'm not kidding.  DeNora would likely argue that our criteria for "greatness" have been pre-determined by the very elements that we then go into a "great work" looking for. The aesthetics of criticism are a social construct, and so is the music; therefore it's no wonder the two fit together so well. Music criticism is taste writ large, that's all. (Sociology, on the other hand, is not subject to these social tastes and trends, of course.)  Actually, I felt upon approaching this book there may be something to her argument. As Michael Walsh jokingly and insightfully remarked in his book Who's Afraid of Classical Music, "Ludwig 'Rights o' Man' Beethoven was always sucking up to royalty in his dedications." It's hard to deny: he knew who buttered his bread. It's easy to view talent, especially when from the distant past, in a vacuum that we don't extend to the present. In today's world I find myself wondering, for just one example, if a fine but unremarkable actress such as Gwyneth Paltrow would be where she is were her mother not Blythe Danner and her father not a prominent TV producer who is good buddies with Steven Spielberg. Is it any coincidence that Gwyneth's first role was in a Spielberg film, Hook?   So what does DeNora say? After several chapters on the state of the aristocracy and aristocratic taste of the time--chapters I enjoyed and am not prepared to defend or debunk--she focuses relentlessly on the famous quote about Beethoven from Count Waldstein, saying he would go forth to receive the spirit of Mozart from the hands of Haydn. DeNora argues, repeatedly, (she seems to think that by repeating a groundless assertion she can make it stick) that this statement played a huge role in elevating Beethoven to greatness in the minds of the Viennese aristocracy. Of course this begs the question how did Mozart and Haydn achieve *their* reputations? Sure Beethoven understood how he could benefit socially from the patronage of Haydn--he?d have to be an idiot not to understand it--but seeing it solely on those simplistic terms ignores the fact that he was innovating, and that except for Mozart and Haydn his contemporaries were not. DeNora seems to make a big deal out of this, saying they were thrown on their own as freelancers because they lacked Beethoven's connections (while giving us no real evidence that this is in fact the reason they "went commercial" and he succeeded as a serious artist). She conveniently ignores the fact that Schubert had no significant connections, yet has also come down to us as a "great composer." Hummel's sonatas, written around the same time as Beethoven's and Schubert's, show just how far ahead of their time Beethoven and Schubert were. But this is not mentioned.  Furthermore DeNora either underplays or seems unaware of the reputation of Mozart, of how his music was also considered extraordinarily difficult well into the 19th century. Beethoven himself singled out the fifth "Haydn" quartet of Mozart and said that in this work Mozart was showing to the world what he could do if only they were ready for it. Of course, some of Beethoven's patrons had also been Mozart's, but this shows the idea of serious music did not begin with Beethoven, and this makes her thesis about changing tastes in the aristocracy weaker.  But DeNora's argument spectacularly self-destructs on page 119, in one of the most amazingly inept chapters of any book I've ever read. She describes the first time pianist Gelinek competed with a young Beethoven in a duel in 1793. Gelinek expressed confidence he would destroy Beethoven--make mincemeat of him by one account. The next day the father of the person telling the tale asks Gelinek how he did and the pianist admitted he was the one pulverized. Keep in mind he did not know of Beethoven or his reputation before the duel. You'd think DeNora would see this as a strike against her thesis, but she actually says (p. 121): "First, whatever Galinek thought of Beethoven is less relevant in this context [!!] than the ways his conversations were converted subsequently into topics in their own right--material for further discussion within the music world." Never mind that this person who never heard Beethoven before and was unaware of his reputation, by DeNora's own admission, was blown away and humbled, what matters is how the result elevated Beethoven's position. It never occurs to her that perhaps it elevated his position because it was deserved! But she doesn't stop there: "Once again, we see that Beethoven's reputation *can be conceived of as the accumulation of a repertoire of recorded, publicized stories about his talent.* [emphasis mine, out of disbelief] She goes on: "In telling the story of Beethoven's talent, Gelinek positioned himself as subordinate to Beethoven (as a less talented but admiring colleague); thus Galinek testified to and helped to publicize a favorable view of Beethoven's talent by aligning his own abilities as inferior to Beethoven's." What is one to make of this idiocy that passes for sociology? DeNora never for a moment considers that perhaps Gelinek simply believed what he said. I think it's obvious she reached her conclusion before she began and worked backwards, determined to cram every fact she uncovered into her theory even if she had to pound the loose ends down with a sledgehammer.  Musicologist and pianist Charles Rosen, in a rebuttal shortly after the DeNora book was published, commented that an ethnomusicologist once told him there surely must be hundreds of "Eroica" symphonies that we just don't know about, written by unknown geniuses galore. As Rosen points out, we do indeed know many if not most of the works of Beethoven's contemporaries; many have been analyzed, revived and recorded. They do not come close to Beethoven in originality, breadth of thought, or structural sophistication. But DeNora, like so many revisionists with an agenda, loses her finely-honed sense of skepticism when dealing with alternative interpretations to events. Then she really tips her hand: "While these programs [of cannonic revisionism] obviously vary in levels of ambition, they share a concern with the ways exclusive or ?high? cultural forms are both inaccessible and inappropriate to the lived experience of a large proportion of the people to whom they are upheld as inspirational."  That astonishing remark could be interpreted in ways ranging from merely patronizing to racist, and it sets DeNora up as a sort of cultural arbiter herself. *Inappropriate?* Says whom? Inappropriate to whom? And why?   After all this, there is still one remaining gripe, and that is DeNora?s writing style. It is repetitious in the extreme. She really has a thin point, and takes well over 200 pages to make it. This book could have been a magazine article or two- or three-part series in a journal. Trash 
 Beware! On off switch broke machine would not cut off unless unplugged. The place they recommended based on my zip code still has my vacuum and it's been about 2 weeks. :- 
 I purchased this product, but after 3 months of frustrating use wound up throwing it away.  The first problem is that the structural support of the power tips between the laptop plug and the cord plug is the electrical solder!  The effect of this is that if you use the adapter on the road where it's subject to a lot of plug and unplug and varying mechanical stress, the solder breaks.  You then at best have a tip with an intermittent connection.  I replaced the tip twice before giving up and getting another better designed adapter.  The second problem is that when I unplugged the power adapter from the wall, it would cause my laptop (IBM T20) to emergency power off.  Unplugged at the laptop plug was fine.  I understand this to be an issue between the T20 power system and a surge issue in the adapter.  I replaced this with a Kensington 33197 120W adapter.  It looks almost like the same product (same OEM?) except they have stronger power tips.  It also didn't have the power-off issue.  I loved the form factor, but the product just didn't work 
 If we are to draw equivalent lessons from both the Prague Spring and street protests in the U.S., as Kurlansky attempts in this book, the connection should depend on more than that they simply occured in the same year.  The reader is owed specifics, yet is rewarded with little more than vague platitudes.  Prague was a protest against a government which not only lacked representation and dissent, but prohibited it.  Chicago et al were protests against decisions made by a representative government, however flawed, resulting from open debate.  A bigger difference could hardly be imagined.  But Kurlansky does see striking differences, albeit only in the post-1968 world.  The Soviet bloc began it's decent to oblivion, while the capitalist West avoided the same.  His disappointment in the latter is not hard to glean, though what manner of "revolution" he envisions is never rendered to specifics, likely for good reason.  But who needs details when false equivalencies and empty platitudes will do 
 I was hoping to get a water bottle that was leak proof and would not sweat. I got neither. It is pretty , but that is about it. 
 After waiting 2 months of the delivery I still have nothing.  There seems to be no way to contact Amazon about this.  Very poor service.  I recommend NOT ordering from them.  I'll have to arrange a charge back on the C 
 This album begins with the great and classic song "Radar Love" and ends with the great and classic song "Twilight Zone."  Between those two songs is one hour of forgettable, mediocre music.  If you did not know better you would think that it was two different bands.   
 Without a doubt, Understanding The Bible, 6th Edition, is a "hatchet job" on the Bible and, as a result, will test the faith of Jews and Christians alike.  But fear not!  Those who are even moderately confident in their religion will see through the author's relentlessly atheistic opinions and view it as an untapped gold mine for the Christian apologetics crowd.  When Mr. Harris (in his chapter bibliographies) recommends, among others, the works of those false witnesses over at the "Jesus Seminar", R.Funk, et al, and their New Thought babblings, then I came to understand the real truth about this book and the author's deceptive intentions.  I have only one thought for those unbelievers who think the Bible and Christ's teachings are wrong and pure folly.  If it is so; if Christianity is wrong, then there can be only ONE FOLLY that replaces it:  the folly of trying to pretend that there is some meaningful reason for life on this earth.     I feel truly sorry for Mr. Harris and those frantic souls similarly aligned; they have nothing but death in a void as their final reward.  This is why they are so angry, pessimistic and cynical in their religious criticism.  As Thomas  Kempis said in My Imitation of Christ (early 1400's) , "All carnal joys enter pleasantly, but in the end bring remorse and death."  As a result, "There is no peace in the heart of a carnal man."  May God bless and keep you all.  Amen. 
 Episode two of the hunt for the bumbling master spy(Peacemaker) is an improvement over the unfortunate initial episode, No Graves as Yet. There are some good scenes: the beaches at Gallipoli, the amusing downfall of Judy's competitor for the General's wheel, the encounter with the German sub, etc.  But we still have the preposterous underlying theme that George V would trade continental Europe for German help in retaking the United States for the British Empire. That task made more difficult as Miss Perry has Mexican armies pouring over the Southwestern border to conquer the U.S. Even Zimmerman didn't expect that much.  Then there is Private Corliss who dominates the opening chapters by suffering a crushed hand, a suspected Self Inflicted Wound(SIW), for which he is court martialed and sentenced to death.  In WWI, the test for an SIW was whether the injury was caused by British ammunition, not the case here. There were 3,894 recorded SIWs in the British Army during the war; the penalty was a prison sentence. No one was subject to the death penalty for an SIW. We have Chaplain Joseph who spends half the book playing police detective; a general in command of substantial forces at Ypres who spends most of his time with his attractive driver and seems to have no contact with his regimental commanders or the battles; a reporter for a small newspaper chain whose accurate depiction from Gallipoli would cause millions of Britons to abandon the war, even though the millions had already heard the truth from their sons, daughters, and husbands; etc. On the bright side, there is a new Pitt mystery, Long Spoon Lane, where Miss Perry makes us feel right at home in both the drawing rooms and the slums of Victorian London.  IMO her reach toward World War I is a war too far. 
 OK as a starter, for someone who knows zero about media, but falls short of the mark for anyone who is a practitioner in a media-related industry.  The first 100 pages are spent on "context" which might be helpful for readers who know nothing about marketing either (Ms. Katz feels it necessary to tell us what the 4Ps are...), but this leaves very little for anyone who actually needs to DO media buying, planning or research 
 You know I'm not into a book when I'm still trudging through it weeks later. It's been 3 weeks and I'm still barely through to the middle of "Lying on the Couch"; I've been taking up other reading material regularly to entertain me in the meantime: Agatha (always entertaining!) and lately, even the commercial inserts from the Washington Post.     Simply said: this book is pretentious, boring, and trite. The author is some sort of actual psychiatrist, so there is a lot of good information for psych-wanna-bes, about the history of psychiatry, the current practices and psychiatric community (ie, how doctors get along with patients, how doctors get along with doctors, etc). That's all great and all and maybe the issues brought up are quite important (ie: transference, abuse, emotional instability, the importance of integrity in the profession of psychiatry, etc. This book tries to take on EVERYTHING! in such a way that the story is disconnected and poor in development of any sort). Most significantly this novel lacks the important elements of a NOVEL:     - good character development (it's fragmented and I can't tell anything about the characters -- there's too many of them and they're all pretty much the same)    - plot (wtf is this story ABOUT? as a STORY? And, if it's just meant to be a commentary, it's certainly not a mediocre one by any means -- take up Reviving Ophelia or I never Promised You a Rose Garden as good commentaries on the psychiatric community.     - effective writing (it reads like a technical manual; this makes sense considering the author is a psychiatrist, and not a writer; it''s certainly NOT POORLY written, but it's not poetic, it lacks style, and fails to captivate)     "Lying on the Couch" lacks climax, characters, and style. I am sad I wasted my time on this book -- unlike other books I have rated poorly based on their literary merit (but which still proved to be slightly entertaining), this book provided me with no new information, and had little to no entertainment value.  
 I had great hope -- sleep !!!!!!    But it is just yet another book advocating abuse of the child for the ease of the parent.  Yes, I want sleep.  NO I will not sacfice my baby's secure attachment to me, and faith in me and the world to get it.  crying it out is abuse pure and simply.  Don't waest your time and money -- if you think this is how to raise a child, do yourfelf and the child a favor and giv the child to someone who will care.  
 Laura Ingraham and others like her (Ann Coulter comes to mind), should thank their lucky stars that America has such a thing as freedom of the press.  In any other country she would never be published.  She propagates the myth that there is political subversion going on in American by so-called "liberals" identified mainly as anybody who does not agree with the neo-Republican agenda.   Frankly, the only political subversion I see going on are the lies Ingraham forwards as truth.  The dangerous things about it are that millions of uneducated readers will read and believe, because they haven't been taught to research and question, and these are the types of readers that Ingraham and others like her bank on...literally. 
 Pros:  Bagless, works well at first  Cons:  Breaks down frequently, the tubes often become blocked despite emptying of the canister in a timely manner, burning rubber smell, and had to replace the belt-twice.  Right now my vacuum is sitting in the middle of the living room.  I want to vacuum, but I can't.  It is broken-again!  It isn't as if I use it all that often, so to have it break down so much is quite frustrating.  Don't waste your money on this cleaner. 
 With the other reviews I read before buying this book, I thought this must contain some groundbreaking techniques, but I was surprisingly disappointed instead. It was more like hyped-up motivational stuff, along with fairly obvious advice along the lines of: Be outgoing, be nice to people, be interested in others, be helpful, present yourself well, etc. I can't say this isn't good advice, but it's not exactly breakthrough. The author also continuously throws in various odd trademarked slogans like "Be Progress". If someone needs basic motivation to get out and confront talking to people, and present themselves well, maybe this book is helpful. Perhaps there isn't a lot more to this subject that anyone could write a good book about 
 This is one of the most influential and most useless books on Hitchcock. The book is very telling, not of its subject matter, but of the author. Sadly, the book received a lot of undue attention and its misconceptions have still not sufficiently diappeared. Absolutely horrendous 
 I'm a big fan of Outlaw and Texas Country, however, still album was not for me.  Hank III is too raw, too basic, and too lacking for me.  However, he does have a very unique sound and style and I can't think of anyone else out there that he sounds like.  Still I'd be cautious about buy this CD and listen to the song samples that Amazon provides 
 No disputing that this is an excellent jazz album and is one of my personal favourites as well as an essential one to have in any music collector's library.  It needs a remastering though and so I'd recommend you go right ahead and get the remastered version.  I just managed to get a remastered version in mini-lp sleeve packaging which is simply brilliant!  The sound quality is like night and day when I played them both back to back.  As the lp sleeve version is very rare and I believe only a few are left on the Tower website where I got mine, I guess that means you'll have to get the jewel case version but that's still a lot better than this version.  Every track here though is a jazz standard; Dexter's sense of humour is what truly endears me to his playing as you'll hear him intersperse samples of other jazz standards (Panacea, Tisket a-Tasket, Take Me Out to the Ballgame among others) throughout the album.  A man in total control of his instrument and a vital influence on future sax greats like John Coltrane who readily cited him as a major influence.  A must have for any jazz lover's music library 
 I can't help thinking "Hidden Diary" was written as a potential candidate for the "Royal Diaries" children's series.  RD had enough sense to publish Kathryn Lasky's "Princess of Versailles" instead which was much more entertaining, historically accurate, and presented M.A. as a more credible character.  I don't think Errickson is at all comfortable with the realm of fiction.  "Hidden Diary" read like a history book being recited by a young girl.  All of the characters are extremely one-dimensional and Errickson provides no motives to develop MA's character.  It reads like,  "Right now I'm in Austria, and I'm in love with the groom....Now I'm in France, and I want to be a good wife, and I still love the groom and his wife is SO jealous....Now I've met Axel and I'm SO in love..." etc.  All in all this is an amateurish and uninspiring work.  The romantic parts weren't romantic since none of the romantic pairs ever really fall in love, everything "just happens" to suit the plotline.    The trecherous chambermaid, Amelie, is a rip off of Madame Defarge.  It's never clarified what her grievances really are or if she's just a psychopath.  Ironically I think Louis XVI may be the one character in the story who touched me.  I felt his characterisation was mostly very believable.  Overall, this book was a deep disappointment to me and I can't reccommend it as entertainment or as a good historical 
 I've been a fan of Clancy's Jack Ryan series for a while. Patriot Games, The Hunt for Red October, and the Cardinal of the Kremlin were all excellent thrillers. The Bear and the Dragon, however, is just terrible. I liked reading Clancy books for the international intrigue and military action. I don't need to hear him opine about the flat tax, abortion, and the Lewinsky scandal on every other page. Nor do I need to hear him refer to the Chinese as "chinks" or "little slant eyed bastards." We get it - they're the bad guys in the book. There's no need to use racial slurs to get your point across. I reliably bought every Clancy book that came out up until this one. After reading The Bear and the Dragon, I'm never buying one again. 
 I felt the book was poorly written and lacked weight in places.  Although the high level definitions were accurate, the detail was messy and the writing style was poor.  The internet could give you better information and detail then buying this book.  I gave it one star because at least the author tried to make the subject matter colorful 
 Brigitte Lin, Maggie Cheung and Donnie Yen are amazing.  I was excited to see a movie that combined their talents, but "Dragon Inn" was a big disappointment.  The plot was too absurd for my liking, the characters felt a little two-dimensional and the fight scenes were only a fraction of what they could have been.  However, some people really like this movie a lot.  My recommendation would be to rent it first.    
 While an interesting work and worth reading, it is not nearly the biography that Blair Jackson's "Garcia" is.  Many aspects of Jerry's life are somewhat polished up it seems.  Not that gory expose is  desirable, but still I was left feeling that perhaps the book had a  censored feel to it.  This is just an opinion.  Read Jackson's book, then  "Dark Star", for a much more complete and well rounded view of  Jerry's life 
 This book is poorly written, _utterly_ disjointed, and has a cloying sentimentality that is really annoying.  By that I mean it's not at all analytical: it includes random snippets of poems, etc. that serve only to confound the reader looking for some meat.  Plus, there are certain phrases like "cutting sign" that I hadn't the foggiest idea about until I looked it up.  Help the reader out here.  Yeah, it's hot as hell in the desert, and it's doggone handy to have water.  It sucks that people are dying in the desert and the forces that draw them to _El Norte_ are highly complex and not necessarily their fault.  Still, they are breaking the law from the word go, and well they know it, and it seems to me there are worse tragedies involving truly innocent people.  Plus, it peeves me to no end that these illegals have largely trashed some of the most beautiful and exotic wildernesses in the U.S.  So my sympathy is just not all that deep.  The photos are for the most part of lousy quality as well.  Why it took carrying several cameras, as the author claims, to produce these pictures is beyond me.  Lastly the book is VERY short, with a ridiculously long appendix addressing every single death that has occurred in this area ... newsflash: no one is going to read that.  How could the editors have allowed a book like this to go to press?  It's absolutely amateurish, despite being driven by sincere emotions 
 There have been short stories that, with the application of some creative imagination and creativity have been successfully transformed  into feature-length films. The less successful attempts have resulted from films that simply `stretched' the short story with extended screen shots, lengthy silences and empty (not plot-advancing) dialogue. It is the second example that is most akin to this book.  This being the case, I will not dignify it with a lengthy review - but will, instead, come quickly and briefly to the point. This book is a deception - a title "The Genius Factory, etc ..." - like a false front on a Hollywood set building.  It might have been more accurately titled something like A Moderately Brief but Resoundingly Boring History of Attempts at Human Artificial Insemination: Both Successful and Unsuccessful. The notion of "Eugenics" and it's swollen popularity, for both humane and evil motives, in the early and mid 20th century is an interesting one and well worth study and reportage. Likewise, the efforts of "Dr." Robert Graham (an Optometrist) to create a sperm bank contributed to only by Nobel Laureates in order to improve what he saw as the degenerating quality of the human species is, again, fascinating and perhaps even important.  Sadly (and surprisingly) this book renders that issue in relatively brief form while dwelling for chapter after chapter on arguably related, but clearly less interesting, information about the history of human A.I. and the author's subjective experiences in looking into (and `experiencing' both it's products and some of it's required activities. What began as a few magazine-type articles in "Slate" have been expanded here to Feature Length - but not by the addition of interesting and relevant new data - but by an expanded spewing of word, historical references, and personal irrelevancies. I would estimate that no more than one-third of the text deal with the subject suggested by the title in a meaningful way. The rest is schlock filler. If I could reclaim the hours I spend listening to this book (yes, I listened to the recorded version) I would.  
 First I want to state all the good things about this book - because they are certainly the principles of this book.  Dr. Andrew Weil's Eating Well for Optimum Health holds a wealth of information. Starting with the chemistry of how your body handles food and then explaining how that affects the goods and bads of what's out there is the basis in which Weil promotes his theories. In a world where foods become vilified and championed alike through various 'studies'... it can be intimidating to know what you should include in an 'optimum diet'. Weil clears a lot of this up and is pretty specific about what vitamins, minerals, whole foods and nutrients we should be nourishing our body with. All in all this is a great book on the science of food.  Now, for the bad part. I actually finished this book over a weekend, sick in bed, about a month ago. I was 'sick of being sick' as some would say and devoured (pardon the pun) this wealth of knowledge. After I was well enough to get back to my routine, I threw away almost every single food item in my kitchen, as almost nothing adhered to the optimum plan. I was still very motivated with my bare cupboards and then set out to turn my family's life around.   Dr. Weil makes it pretty clear that you are going to pretty much have to go exclusively organic, bar a few, and I mean few, fruits and vegetables. He even states that some non-organic fruits and vegetables are so toxic in their non-organic state you should never consume them - strawberries for example. Something Weil will also state is the pesca-ovo-vegetarianism diet is his diet of choice, because almost all meats are riddled with hormones that greatly impact our own bodies. The optimum food pyramid doesn't really include animal proteins, so if you aren't a vegetarian, you'll have some serious issues to resolve.  He tells you he loves food, and feels anyone who misses the point and stops enjoying food is wasting their time. I totally agree, but in practice, this book does just about that. Demonizing foods based on the fears of cancer and inflammatory disease can be a difficult pill to swallow, particularly if you've consumed these foods all of your life. The nature of label reading and being a smart consumer can literally drive you insane. It's certainly beneficial, we know that, but making it a lifestyle will require more then just a bit of education.  This book also is not for anyone seeking weight-loss through diet modification. Weil explains it certainly can be done, but he spends more time telling you what diets, such as Atkins, not to partake in. This fact is actually not a negative side to the book. However given the nations statistics on obesity I think this could have been a more helpful aspect of the book if he developed it.  I will end with this: This book could/would be an incredible useful tool if you were any or (ideally all) of the following:  1. You are wealthy. Try buying exclusively organic. It's outrageous. Most working families can not afford this lifestyle, contrary to the notion that prepared and processed foods are expensive. Prepared and process foods are cheap - that's why Americans consume them at such high rates. He suggest to organic co-op farms, but even as late as 2006 they can be scarce for most people in the suburbs, and when you do find them, they will only be cheaper then buying organic from natural food stores and chains, which isn't saying much. Don't be shocked when you find vine-ripened organic tomatoes at $5.99 a pound.  2. You do not work. Almost exclusively cooking from scratch, which is even acknowledged by Weil, will be the hardest transition for anyone who works full-time or has a family. This is probably the saddest aspect of this book. There certainly is nothing wrong with from cooking wholesome, healthy meals from scratch - but it isn't the norm for most people. If you buy the foods recommended, you'll be spending about 70% of your day in the kitchen if preparing 3 meals.   3. You already lead a healthful and active lifestyle. If this is you then you probably already knew much of Weil's intuitive advice and therefore will need only tweaking to adhere to the optimum plan.  My personal experience with this book is that you can back yourself into a corner with fear. If you work and have a family I suggest you skip this book. Working in your 5+ a day fruits and vegetables, organic or not, and leading an active lifestyle is a good place to start. The Eating For Optimum Health book creates a pretty black and white picture. And we all know life isn't black and white.   
 DVD's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the XBOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had 
 The first novel of Laurell K. Hamilton's Merry Gentry series is not, actually, that terrible a book. It's by far the best in a not particularly great series, actually. What made it almost impossible for me to read is that the basic premise, the set-up, is one of the most grotesquely, ridiculously stupid things I've ever read.   Princess Meredith NicEssus has fled Faerie, in fear of death at the hands of her aunt, Andais, the Queen of Air and Darkness and ruler of the Unseelie Court. High profile fae in this world are major public figures, like rock stars or the royal family of England. The sudden disappearance of one of the Unseelie royals is a very big deal indeed. Every news media in the world reports the story....and it never goes away. We are told solemnly that reports of Princess Meredith being spotted are right up there with Elvis sightings. Meredith's image, the story of her mysterious disappearance, is everywhere. I mean, neolithic pygmies living in deepest Africa know who Meredith is, and what she looks like.   Meanwhile, Princess Meredith has disguised herself as a mortal private eye. Thing is, she hasn't disguised herself very much at all. Her supernaturally pale skin is now humanly pale skin. Her fae red hair is now human red hair. Her facial features remain the same. And with everyone on the planet wondering where is Princess Meredith, for years on end, no one recognizes her. Let me hasten to add, there is no magic involved in this, they honestly simply don't recognize her. And the crowning touch to this masterful disguise, the name chosen for her pseudonym to hide the fact she's actually Princess Meredith is....wait for it....Merry Gentry.   Jesus wept.   And for years, none of her co-workers, no one who knows her, says to themself, "Hey, wait a minute, that women who looks almost exactly like Princess Meredith....Merry Gentry....Princess Meredith....oh my God, Merry Gentry is Princess Meredith!" Nope, she's just incognito, baby.   At which point I almost threw down the book and said, "You have GOT to be kidding me." It's absolutely amazing to me this made it through the editing process. Do Laurell Hamilton's editors do anything other than rubber stamp her writing? Given her past six or eight novels, including this one, I'm tempted to say: no, actually 
 It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.  I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.  If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage 
 Does Deniro even appear in this movie?  Talk about false advertising.  
 While some movies require that you throw out your disbelief, I had a very hard time doing so with this movie.  This movie was just plain stupid.  They should have kept this film story in the states.  Once everything moves over to Tokyo, the film plummets into inauthenticity the likes of which I haven't seen in a long time.  I would have respected the film 1,000 times more had it ended when the main character goes to Japan.  So let's get this straight, Japanese high school students act like American high school students?  Lucas Black's character is simply told to go to a Japanese high school where he will simply pick up the language and make do?  Everybody speaks English ? His father lives in a tiny apartment yet has a garage that's about double the size of his apartment?  I would have much preferred subtitles and a story that felt, looked and sounded more Japanese.  Japanese students are among some of the most polite students you will ever meet.  The Japanese culture is steeped and immersed in being respectful, polite and dutiful.  Real Japanese high school students would be embarassed by the way their culture was represented here.  Actually they probably wouldn't be embarassed, they would laugh at the film's poor attempt in showing true or even remotely true Japanese culture.  Japanese culture is not steeped in American hiphop and egocentric behavior and it's a pity so many Americans will see this film and actually think that Japanese students are just like American students.  There would be nothing further from the truth.  Japanese students do not act, look or sound like what was filmed here.  Not by a long shot.  Given my dislike of how the Japanese culture was handled in this film, it left me finding the plot irrelevant.  The plot was OK but it would have been much better if they had either stuck to a more authentic representation of Japanese culture or kept the story in the states.    
 Get this set if you plan on having a bad time.  Barely will you be in to 'Good evening' when the lessons quickly turn to "Stop thief!" or "He stole my watch"  or better yet, "I want an attorney"  -- all of which are phrases I have NEVER used in France.  Fodor's should have had the good sense to give practical lessons first,  etiquette, directions, service, culture etc. before launching into rude commands and pick-pocket paranoia 
 This is Marcuse's most famous work and one that was a major influence on and during the student revolts all over the European continent of 1968. Many of the catchphrases of that time, such as "repressive tolerance" and the like, are derived directly from Marcuse. He has since lost much of his popularity and audience, and in my view, quite deservedly so.  His main thesis is that modern man has become one-dimensional due to the totalitarian, all-encompassing exercise of power by the entrenched capitalist class. While this of itself is not such a bad idea, though certainly romanticizing and exaggerating reality, his approach to explaining and attacking it leaves very much to be desired. Marcuse overuses empty or unexplained phrases endlessly (like "cutting off perspectives through an overwhelming ossified concreteness of imagery" and similar things) while at the same time hardly making use of any prior thought or philosophy on the subject at all. This makes the impression of much ranting and little content. Even worse is his general laziness as a thinker - he never actually bothers to explain why such a full-spectrum dominance has occurred or how he wants to prove its existence, he merely asserts it and then goes on about the manifold bad effects it has.  Rather bizarre in this context, and perhaps even nihilistic, is his general dislike of what he perceives as "rationality". He only uses this word in negative contexts (particularly in the context of industrial expansion) and seems to consider it the primary form of "one-dimensional thinking", affected by the symbolism of capitalism. Now it is one thing to say that the fashionable concept of rationalism is false and ill-founded, but to reject relying on rational processes altogether as he seems to do is a bit too much.  To put it bluntly, everything Marcuse has written in this book has also been written in, say, Debord's "The Society of the Spectacle", and then in half as many words and quite more philosophically coherent. The early Marcuse (of Eros and Civilization) was much better; this book warrants no more interest than a purely antiquarian historical one 
 Argento seems to be able to make GREAT horror as POOR ones. With a plot he already used a couple of times and filmed like he did also a couple of times, Dario Argento offers his daughter, not a bad actress at all, in one of his average work. It's no his worst movie but it's not fantastic either. The Hitchcock theme sounds sometimes like a very low budget music score, a pity! For me, not the revelation of Dario Argento's Art...This film could have been released decades ago, it's more like he didn't evolve at all and he simply makes the same recipe again and again. For ARGENTO fans only : You will find the mark of the master in this 
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 Bands from the 90s just sucked and Nirvana fits in with that. They had a couple of ok songs and Kurt Cobain was some what talented but this is nothing to get excited about. I can not for the life of me see the things people see that just go off about how great they were. I don't see it. This is another cd in a long line of cds from the 90s that are a disgrace to music. 
 This was really, really bad.  I read about 1/4 the way through then had to quit 
 I'm actually really shocked that the reviews for this have been so good. I don't know... maybe when I was a teenager I would have found the jokes in DIRTY DEEDS funny, but not anymore. Although, I laughed at AMERICAN PIE (the first one) and that was pretty sophmoric? Not sure. So, I finally came to the conclusion that DIRTY DEEDS... JUST WASN'T FUNNY.  The concept in Dirty Deeds is a pretty decent one. The school has a secret list of dirty deeds hidden and very few have attempted to, or have completed all of them in one night. And when they do complete all 10 deeds, they get to add another for the next to take the challenge. The deeds range from... punching the toughest guy in the school, bringing a dead guy from the morgue to the school, drinking a beer in front of a cop... etc. etc. etc.  But the concept was wasted with poor writing, sophmoric sense of humor and a weak attempt to capitalize off the success of all the other teenager having sex comedies that have come rolling out of the gate ever since Hollywood figured out that teenagers are making up a very large percent of the Movie theatre revenue intake.  Yet, the jokes in DIRTY DEEDS never really exceed stuff that made me laugh when I was ten. Somebody getting punched real hard, masterbation, or somebody farting... and of course... as the title of my review suggests... of course it has the American Pie ripoff jokes. In American Pie... the character "does it" with a pie... in Dirty Deeds... it's a loaf of wheat bread... and of course the jerk principal buys the loaf and eats it... wondering what the white... yeah... I won't elaborate.  And then there's the hot girls like Lacey Chabert, Arielle Kebbel and Zoe Saldana! I like them all. They're all very pretty. They do nothing. In fact... all three of them may as well have been credited as cameos because they weren't in it much. Lacey Chabert is in it the most, but her character is VERY VERY SERIOUS and apprently not into having FUN and it comes across. She has no jokes at all. Zoe Saldana has a very very very tiny role and Arielle Kebbel has a small role in which she makes out with some dork freshman because he had the balls to talk to a senior.  I've had it folks. I have it with the RIPOFFS and the sequels and the remakes and the lack of originality. The writers need to take some time and make sure the laughs deliver. The studios need to stop greenlighting things that aren't ready, just so they can catch the tail end of a dieing trend.  DIRTY DEEDS is a bad movie that could have been better if the makers would have had a more original goal in mind, instead they chose to CONFORM, rush into production and it went straight to the video shelves 
 For the price you cant beat this product, IF the problem I'm experiencing can be solved.  I bought two of these brushes, one for my home bathroom and one for my work-out bag. Love the price and timer feature...  But it seems that once I've used up the power in the brush, it wont recharge properly. I'm experiencing this problem with both brushes no matter how long I leave it in the charger. If there is a simple fix for this then I'd say 5 stars. If not, then 2 Stars is well earned, seeing as how I've been on their support line waiting (as I type this) for over an hour 
 I bought this for our baby and like many of the reviewers, I was disappointed in the synthesized music.  I have played some of the pieces, and although the concept is good, I want my child to hear music as it was on intended on the real instruments.  
 Nice looking toaster, makes good toast, but one MAJOR problem that I've had.  When making toast, especially when only making one slice, the slice pops right out of the toaster. If I'm not there to catch it, (like that old "I Love Lucy" episode where Lucy always catches the toast from the toaster, when making Ricky breakfast), I end up picking my toast up from the counter, or sometimes the floor.  Unfortunately there's no way to correct this without having to go through the hassle of having it repaired, so I guess I'm stuck with this "projectile toaster".  By the way President Bush, I think I might have found one of those "weapons of mass destruction" 
 THIS BOOK IS FULL OF $%#*, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! I'VE CALLED MANY OF THE NUMBERS AND THEY NO LONGER EXIST. THIS BOOK IS A FRAUD AND A WAST OF TIME. ""I HATE THIS BOOK 
 The Next Generation is basically a remake of the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, in fact up to an hour into the film the plot is practically identical, though different characters and locations are used.  The original was a little overrated in my opinion and this "remake" is quite frankly terrible.  Bad acting with the exception of Renee Zellweger and Matthew McConaughy who do their best with a terrible script and several B movie actors.  The only major differences from the original are that Leatherface now dresses as a woman, which was fairly amusing but hardly essential, and a tacked on conspiracy theory.  The conspiracy theory of a secret society only surfaces in the last half hour and is absolutely ridiculous, I won't explain it, theres no point, watch it yourself if you want to know how stupidly the film ends.  I would sooner suggest avoiding this film completely though, even die hards admit its awful, I only gave it 2 stars because I reserve 1 star for the very worst of the worst (yes even worse than this!) 
 The song that is played in the background while Paul Walker is driving his red pickup truck towards Torreto's deli is called "Deep Enough" (Remix) by the band called "Live".  The album is called "V".   [... 
    It's a little known fact but George Peppard later said in interviews that he hated this series, frequently did not get along with his co-stars (particularly Mr.T) and hate the child scripts that Stephen Candell would turn out each week.   It's easy to see why, Two of the actors; Mr.T and Dirk Benedict really could not act and did not work on anything big after this show fizziled out in 1985.  Dwight Schultz did continue to work and turned up in supporting roles in various TV movies and films, so he at least had some acting talent to speak of, but really the only real star of this series was George Peppard, and his more memmorial TV work should be as the Private Insurance investigator, Benecheck.   
 The concept of this book could've worked, but Sparks didn't develop any other characters to throw the reader off track. It's painfully obvious who is driving the car. The dialogue between Miles and Sarah when they are first getting to know each other is extremely annoying, as is their relationship. Interesting how she breezes into their family and is accepted by Jonah with open arms. And the ending to the story is laughable. I won't give it away, but I'm sure you can figure it out within the first 10 pages. I doubt I can read another Sparks novel again. 
 This is a ho-hum buddy picture about a bunch of guys driving aimlessly around the west for "one last fandango" before they get drafted. Most of their time is spent ragging on one guy, "pheelyp," to the point where one wonders why he is friends with the other three. The peril of Vietnam hangs in the background while these dopes carry on with their fake Texas accents. Passable popcorn fun if you've got nothing better to do.  
 I ordered 14 Eric Carle books because I loved his hungry catterpiller, polar bear and brown bear books however the 14 others I ordered were very disappointing.  I never have time to go to the post office or else I would have returned every single one including this book 
 You like repetitition, repetition, repetition: you'll love this. The musicians let fly oh so rarely. This one got hyped. I fell for it. Shame on me 
 After feverishly finishing Shadowmancer, I instantly went out and bought this novel. Boy, what a disappointment! This book is so lame. Lamer than Attack of the Clones and ewoks combined- and, from me, that is a HUGE insult. It was so bad I hardly forced myself to finish it. I loved Shadowmancer because it so vibarantly expressed Biblical truth in a way that unbelieving readers- Harry Potter exuberants, especially- might not exactly realize what they were reading, but would still get some basic and beautiful truths about Christ into their heads. That was all erased from this novel. NOTHING! Nothing whatsoever. I could almost say that the Buddhist and New Age-swamped Star Wars saga is more spiritually inline than this novel. What happened to good theology? What happened to the grace of Christ? What happened to His love? His protection? How He crushes evil under His heel? What happened to Deutoronomy's harsh veiw on magic that causes me to avoid Harry Potter?   And besides that, it was just not well written at all. Just as bad as Eragon, and GP Taylor is HOW much older than Christopher Paolini?! Tolkien probably wrote this bad when he was FIVE!   Terrible book. Stay away.  But does anybody want my copy? 
 The pictures are great. Forget the rest. This is a poorly-written book. The paragraphs do not flow into each other. I felt it was far too slanted towards making us believe that Lennon was a negative character, and that his relationship with Yoko was basically just "bickering". I don't agree with this at all and feel that other books and interviews with actual people who knew Lennon give a much different picture than the one presented here. Go to the Library and borrow a copy to flip through the pictures. Don't buy this book.  On another note: Lennon the New York Years is a fantastic book that I highly recommend. 
 This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.  
 Science, properly understood, means proving a hyphothesis and having that proof replicated by one's peers.  This was not done with McCrone's "proof" obtained only by McCrone using his "instruments".  No verification by reputable laboratories equals taking McCrone's "proof" as a matter of faith ..........in McCrone.  A fool's choice 
 I bought this book because my son started talking about outer space and rockets, etc... I also bought it because we have several other Byron Barton books and my son really enjoys reading and looking at. However, this book is a little boring, doesn't keep his interest and isn't on the same level as the other Barton books 
 That is the bottom line for this author.  She spends way too much time telling us to "embrace" our new, thick waistlines, and too little time on any real information or help.  Don't bother exercising. just give up and eat smaller amounts of whatever it is that made you fat in the first place, get 9 hours of sleep every night (good luck with that!) and eliminate all stress from your life. That's all you have to do, and then you'll only gain 10 pounds during menopause instead of 20 or 30.  Save your money 
 I orinally posted a very sarcastic review of this product, but when I contacted the seller, I was given a full refund.  Therefore, I will say they have good customer service, but I still don't think the product is useful for storing magazines.  They are made of a plastic that is simply not rigid enough to support a stack of magazines.  
 Wow was that ever awful! I'd write more but Im busy cleansing my DVD player after loading that steaming pile!! 
 I bought this product for my 3 month old for Christmas and when I went to play with it, the remote didn't work. I did everything it said to do and it still didn't work. So, I took it back and just exchanged it for another thinking it was just faulty. When I took it out, the remote to it also didn't work. It says it has to be on "Play" (not Try me or Off) and it has to do it's short musical fanfare after you push the button on the front and then you can use the remote but nope. You should be able to control the volume, the song options, and be able to switch from colors to music but no. It just plain doesn't work. I really want it to work because it would be great in the car but sadly, I will have to take it back but this time I'll get my money back......I do not suggest buying this product 
 Was happy with this toaster until I had it for about 4 months. At that time the lever started acting up by not staying down.  Sometimes it worked other times we had to prop something heavy on it to keep it down. Not what I expect from a $70 toaster. Well, I have finally given up (2 months later) and am sending it back to Hamilton Beach since too much time has passed to send it to Amazon. They are sending me a new one, which I am not sure I am happy about. Might just exchange it somewhere for a toaster-oven......... 
 Did Danielle really write this?  It seems like it was written by an adolescent girl.  I thought it might get better but it never did.  I'm glad this was a library book 
 I produce motion graphics with Adobe After Effects, and have constantly run into the problem that on-line tutorials start with preparing or creating files in Photoshop first, then bringing those files into After Effects for manipulation.  When I tell people I am a videographer, so many say "oh, you must be great with Photoshop then", so finally, I decided to take the plunge and try to learn this program.  This book and the reviews here seem to me highly misleading. The book goes on at great length about out to customize your settings, or the advantage of CMYK over RGB, or "Color Management Systems Explained", but says little about how to actually USE the program. I'm brand new to Photoshop. Why am I reading about pixel and bit depth before even being shown a simple tutorial on how to get up and running with the program? This book is not for beginners.  It is also not a book for people looking to use Photoshop in conjunction with motion graphics or computer graphics.  It is a book that is dedicated to modifying/optimizing images for print, a mere fraction of Photoshop's uses/capabilities in todays graphics industry.  Also note, my wife is an experienced, professional Photoshop user (she uses it every day at her work), and she felt this review was spot on. 
 I purchased the Panasonic KX-TG5571M to replace a 8 year old Sony 900MHZ phone.  The Sony would allow me to go about 400 feet from the base before the signal became unusable.  The new Panasonic has a usable range on the order of 60 feet.  I have a one story, 20 year old, 3000 Sq. Ft, brick home.  Relocating the phone did not help. I returned the phone for credit and bought a Panasonic KX-TG5583, which is the same phone but with three color handsets, thinking the first unit may have been bad.  NOT THE CASE.  The replacement is just as poor in range. All the other features of the phone are good and work as advertised. If range is a concern for you, you would do well to look at some other system 
 This is J.A. Jance at her worst and the readers simpering narrations doesn't help 
 The book is well written and thorough description of the territorial claims of Armenia towards its neighbour Azerbaijan. The conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, the part of which the former has been from the outset of the history is described on an ill-balanced way. Though, it is useful to get an accord of the opposite opinion for the reader who is familiar with the realities and truth 
 Thirteen bucks for two tracks?!  And they wonder why music companies are hurting and Limewire flourishses... .  Duh 
 Hey, I wasn't expecting much but seriously, these are a pretty bad.  I bought two of these for my office.  The plastic shade comes all dented and looks so cheap.  The stupid pieces don't fit together right and so if you move it,  you have to pick it up from the base or it falls apart.   AND the switch gets stuck pretty much all the time so that it's really hard to turn it.  I'm the kind of person who enjoys fixing things so I've taken it apart and tried to fix it and its still rotten.  The second lamp is just completely broken now after only 6 weeks.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!  I'm back on amazon looking for new lamps actually : 
 Sometimes, reviewers on Amazon give the reading public a great disservice ... and this is one of those times. I don't know what Preston & Child's game is, but their writing seems aimed at the junior-high crowd. Nothing wrong with that, but it would have been nice if there had been a disclaimer on the cover: "Warning - lame plot, bad writing, juvinile characters ... scratch that - no character development whatsoever 
 alex cross. yes. james patterson. yes. stories about sex, violence, murder, thrill, suspence, money, victems, etc. PLEASE DO NOT INVOLVE PREGNANCY'S AND CHILDREN! this is too much. 
 This book is a novel about Bennett Lang, a scholar of theoretical physics, and is told in short vignettes about his life, in terms of his relationships. These are in the form of relationships with teachers, lovers, friends and colleagues.  While the book purports to be a novel, as opposed to how skillfully and beautifully Einstein's Dreams was told in short, distinct and separated vignettes, it doesn't have the main aspect that we expect in a novel, which is that we expect to be able to connect the dots in the story to form a line of plot. While I think this book has something to offer in terms of some of its ideas on academia, ambition and relationships, they are not presented cohesively enough to make themselves known in a real and felt way for the reader.   Around 10 pages from the end of this book, I asked my husband, "Will we find out what this is ABOUT soon?" I think it would be more effective if it were more definitely divided a la "Einstein's Dreams" or more overtly connected, in the form of a more traditional novel. I would recommend skipping this one, and picking up "Einstein's Dreams" if you haven't already. That is a beautiful book! 
 I struggle with this movie. I'm a die-hard fan of Jean-Claude Van Damme, so part of me really likes this movie. But the other part knows that this is a very subpar direct-to-video with a slow script, uninteresting characters, and horrendously bad acting (save for JCVD himself). Having said this, I can honestly reccomend it to fans of Van Damme. They will certainly have a good time watching the muscles from Brussles kick the tar out of some low-life hicks while drinking with his Indian buddy and pickin' up chicks. If this appeals to you, there shouldn't be any reason why you wouldn't like "Desert Heat." If even one of this doesn't sound good, stay far away 
 You can bet that if Peter David had lifted a cliche as hoary as the "I am Spartacus" moment for one of his stories, he would have at least given a nod to his source! Spock as messiah became fairly tedious, as did the rehash of 'old codger from OST becoming a liability and then proving himself' plot line from RELICS. Dry, humorless, with action scenes that lead nowhere and a seemingly superficial grasp on what makes the characters tick. I just don't get why Mr. Friedman is so popular. I've been so pleased with the overall improvement in the ST fiction offerings in the last few years - Kevin Ryan, Peter David, Greg Cox and others have all been able to incorporate and expand the dimensions of the trek universe with wit, heart and intelligence. Like another reviewer here, I keep trying to like this author's books since he is so prolific, but damn it, Jim, Star Trek fiction should never be a chore 
 I love Niki Burnham's work...usually.  This book disgusted me!  Chloe, the main character, spent chapters complaining about her amazing looks.  About the zits she never gets, the weight she never gains, the envious stares she recieves, and as a teenage girl who does get the zits, does gain the weight, and is nto often the bearer of those unbearable stares it frustrated me to no end to listen to that.  I put down the book nearly immeadiately because my self esteem was completely and devastatingly shattered.  Thanks Niki, thanks a lot 
 When I received this it was covered in mold and when they sent the replacement it was the same. Needless to say I returned both! 
 WOW i cant believe im the only one that noticed that it's been recently remade with a sci-fi twist in ultra-vioelet, which I've heard also sucks 
 Once again I have to disagree with every other reviewer.   Greek Homosexuality is a strange book. It is also infuriating. I was never able to read an entire chapter of it. I threw it several times in the garbage can and then went out again to retrieve it because I thought I should know more about Greek gays. But the fact is that the more I read the less I understood what Greek homosexuality was. My own take is that the writing of Greek Homosexuality is an extreme case of a rampant scholarly disease called "not seeing the forest because of the trees".   If you want to buy this book because you are anxious to know whether homosexuality was widespread in ancient Greece and whether it was really accepted as a normal form of sexual behavior, let me tell you that the author has no definite answer to these two crucial questions. These are the kind of general questions he eludes or is honest enough to leave unanswered because the evidence is unconclusive. I spoke of honesty, but I sometimes put down the fuziness of all this to a wrong understanding of what it means to be objective. To be objective doesn't mean to just align dozens and dozens of pottery fragments and ancient author quotes and other scholarly references and then leave the reader to decide what this all means.   As I have just said, Greek Homosexuality is replete with hundreds of details about homosexuality in art, in law, in philosophy, in language. But the trouble is that it is almost  completely devoid of enlightening syntheses. Therefore every time I read a few pages in this book, I ended up knowing less about homosexuals in ancient Greece than when I took it up. This sounds incredible, yet it is true. I have tried to read the whole book several times, but simply wasn't able to. I keep getting lost in thickets of disconnected details while the myriad qualifications with which they are hedged about and the dry and technical language get the better of all my intellectual machettes.   Therefore my conclusion is: Greek Homosexuality is un-rea-da-ble! But I will gladly admit that the numerous black and white photographs of male nudes depicted in Greek art are gorgeous and give the reader a fleeting sense of understanding the whole mess of details in the rest of the book.   Touto biblion ouk esti kalon...   
 There is no reason to read The Cloud in translation. It is written in simple prose and in one of the easiest Middle English dialects for Modern English speakers to read. This edition of the book is an unnecessary  translation into Modern English in which a great deal of the original works subtleties and nuances are lost. Because the text was written with such close attention to language it is truly inexcusable for any one to read it in translation when then original is completely accessible to the Modern English speaker. I therefore recommend the edition the TEAMS Middle English Texts Series, edited by Patrick J. Gallacher and available for roughly the same price, instead of this version 
 Very general information for the hefty price. Reading a few inexpensive computer magazines on this topic would be more helpful than this expensive book 
 This piece of filth was written by a self-loathing male and is bought by misandric, self-centered imbeciles. It's nothing but a grocery list of men's faults and an insinuation that women, in contrast, are perfect. Even violence against men is joked about: suggestions of women shooting men and even severing their private parts.  If there were a similar book about WOMEN being awful, NOW would have sent death threats to the publishing house. Ridiculing men for about a hundred pages is no different.  This piece of sexist garbage is for the woman who says how much she hates men -- and then wonders aloud why no one will go out with her. Who in his right mind would 
 If this would have been the first James Patterson book I ever read, it would have been the last (and that would have been a shame!).  Too gory (without any real purpose), too many characters (who are very one-dimensional) and too much stuff going.  That being said, I did quit reading this book about 1/3 of the way through (which I hardly ever do).  Maybe I missed out on the good stuff in the last part of the book, but I really doubt it 
 I didn't find this book terribly useful.  Most of the concepts presented in the book were common sense and did not specifically apply to business.  The book centered around typical social etiquette (which certainly applies  in the business world), but did not provide much business-specific  guidance.  I found that most of the concepts were covered in general  etiquette publications.  I was also disappointed to find that the book did  not provide specific solutions for breaches in business etiquette.  I guess  I was looking for some nice catch-phrases and replies for the business  user.  I do think the book was simple to read, and might be a good book for  newcomers to American business etiquette 
 I have been a huge fan of the Anna Pigeon mysteries.  The hard truth about Hard Truth is skip it.  It is a very unpleasant experience.  The graphic representation of child abuse and cruelty in this book still makes me ill.    What I've loved about the Anna Pigeon series is that I felt like I got a good sense of the national park where the story took place with an appreciation for the natural beauty of the area.  I doubt Anna spent more than a night in Rocky Mountain National Park.  Not only does she completely miss the unique character of the park but the park has no necessary link to the story.  The whole thing could have taken place in urban Chicago.  I have been picking up Nevada Barr books as fast as I could find them.  This book, however, was truely repulsive.  I'll be much more cautious about investing a part of my life in her next book 
 Our book club read this last month and not a single member had anything good to say about this book.  As the facilitator, I was surprise by the consensus since we usually have at least one or two members who love the monthly selection.  The writing is disjointed to the point that Ms. Krauss loses her reader.  Then when she introduces the potential that many of the chapters might just be imaginary interactions between the characters, the reader is left extremely frustrated.  I really cannot imagine how Ms. Krauss' novel has garnered so many stellar reviews 
 For much less than the price of this lexicon, one can purchase a copy of Thayer's, AND Trenchard's vocabulary guide AND a Greek concordance.  Academic snobs make a big deal about how Thayer's lexicon is out of date because he did not have access to the papyri, but for 99% of New Testament words and meanings this is not an issue.  Trenchard's book is actually MORE helpful, in my opinion, than this or any lexicon because he simply lists every possible meaning of each word.  One way to get to the essence of a word's meaning is to look at the cognates, and Trenchard lists them all.  A Greek concordance will actually print all the NT uses of a word in Greek.  Bauer's lexicon is just not that helpful and is too wordy.   
 Ethan Canin is a great short story writer, but when it comes to novels, he misses the target.  His short stories are great because they are brief, and are told through actions and conversations, not sentimentality and excessive introspection.  Blue River, like For Kings and Planets, are undisciplined works, perhaps too ambitious, with overwrought language and too much filler material.  A much better story with the same theme appear in the Palace Thief, called Batorsag and Szerelem 
 This product is a waste of time! Don't bother. The handheld game is entertaining for my daughter, but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least! Once connected, we walked around the "virtual world" with nothing to do. It is too complicated for my 8 yr old to do alone. There are much better products out there for children that are similar, but easier to play with. I would suggest Webkinz or Neopets. These 2 sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play, unlike the Muichiz site! Good luck.. 
 The problem is mainly that these jokes are heavily outdated.  Be very careful about using any of them.  Use "Look Inside" feature to see that these jokes are just plain not funny 
 I was so disappointed with this book, and am surprised at the number of fabulous reviews it received.  Every page demanded that I revel in my "feminist roots."  For any would-be stay at home moms interested in supporting their husbands by keeping house, fixing dinner, and doing laundry in addition to taking care of the kids--this is not the book for you.  It encourages you to not "give in" to the stereotypes and does not acknowledge that there may in fact be jobs just for dads and jobs just for moms.  I know this is not a popular view, maybe I'm the only one around who thinks this.  Your husband, however, may not be overjoyed if you take this book to heart!!!  Also, for any mothers seeking a more spiritual path to staying at home, this book advocated TOTAL CONTROL by you in your decisions--really letting your own self-interests direct your routine instead of those around you or giving up those self-interests in pursuit of a higher calling.  Even though I consider myself to be a feminist in many ways, this book was TOO MUCH 
 As a professional photographer, I found this book extremely disappointing. I purchased it because of the 'good' rating reviews I read under its title and the one good photograph which is on the cover. His lighting is terrible and his 'point of focus' using a macro lens, along with the compositions, make absolutely no sense. The only thing I would use this book for is to lecture on 'how not to do macro photography' 
 I enjoy reading Wodehouse books - twice - once to find out the twisted plot and the 2nd to enjoy the language.  This is one of my favorites - I dearly love the old man butler/Lord.  There is a 2nd book with him in also - sorry, can't remember the name.  I would recommend this book to any who likes Wodehouse books 
 Ah, true Love.  Dinner by candlelight.  Holding hands in the moonlight.  Snapping a new clip on your Glock while your significant other sprays you with semi-automatic love missiles.  I appreciate a dark comedy as much as the next curmudgeon, yet MR. & MRS. SMITH annoys more than it entertains.  True, there is a predictable plot about a beautiful couple stuck in a rut--a couple who, unbeknownst to one another, are professional assassins (just try to stop that suspension of disbelief train).  Add to that the erotic chemistry between Brad and Angelina; my eyebrows are still singed after watching them.  But all the sexiness and over-the-top, lamebrained action fail to overcome the annoyance of Pitt's detached smirk and Jolie's constant flirtation with wackiness.  As the fighting (boy, is there fighting) escalates, I was suddenly asking myself, "Wouldn't it be great if they popped each other off?"  Maybe in the sequel.  While we're at it, would someone please feed Angelina a steak, mashed potatos. . .something?  Nothing wrong with being slim 'n trim, but come on, lose the East Africa look.  In the long run, MR. & MRS. SMITH's biggest problem was the fact Vince Vaughn didn't appear enough.  At least he gets paid to be annoying. --D. Mikel 
 The leaves are changing color and the days are getting cooler.  " I smell winter in the air," said bear.  " It is time for me to crawl into my cave and sleep."  " But I must tell snail  first."   	As a forest of friends, realize that the leaves are  changing and that winter is coming, they must tell each other. It starts  with bear, and she tells snail.  Snail tells skunk then skunk must tell  turtle and the list goes on. Finally, ladybug gets the message and she goes  to tell bear.  When she gets there, bear is already sleeping in her cave.  Lady bug wakes up bear and tells her that winter is near and that is time  for her to crawl into her cave and sleep.  Bear says "Ladybug, I am in  my cave and I was sleeping." Ladybug says she is sorry.   Then all the  animals say goodnight to each other. 	This book is not very exciting  compared to most children's books. There is not really a turning point.   All that the tale does is repeat the same thing from animal to animal. The  animals just tell each other that winter is coming and that it is time to  sleep. Author Denise Fleming did a poor job of writing the story.  The  moral of the story, which is to go to sleep when it is bedtime, was weak.   She could have easily put in more detail and action and still get the same  point across. 	Even though the author did a bad job with lack of  excitement she did do a good job of describing the setting and what was  going on.  When snail is moving Fleming used the words " slowly  slithered", when she described how turtle moved, she used the words  " trudged up Woodchucks hill," and she used the words "  scritch and scratch" to describe how skunk was digging.  By using  these words the reader can picture how the animals were moving. Although  the writing was bad the illustrations were good.  The pictures are the only  thing that the book has going for it.  The illustrator did a great job of  showing detail and using bright colors. The leaves were bright and  different colors, just as they would be expected to be in the fall.  Good  detail was also used with the shape of the leaves, trees, animals, and each  animal's house. Some other good things about the book are that the print is  big, there are only a few sentence on each page, and there are not very  many big words.  These are good examples of why this book would be good for  kids who are learning how to read. Because there are not a lot of big  words, so kids would be able to understand what they are reading. 	  Time to Sleep would make a great bedtime story, because it would probably  bore kids to death.  This book would be a great story for kids to read, but  because of its lack of excitement it wouldn't be a very good book to read  to them. 								- Jessica Pac 
 It is obvious why this book is heralded by all the trendy PC thinkers in NZ today as a work of inspired genius: the white man is to blame for all the ills suffered by the brown man in NZ today and deserves to feel guilty about it. I do not subscribe to this view. The author simply puts his own spin on NZ's history, and his 'opinions' are rarely capable of being supported by relevant research data. In only the first 20 to 30 pages the author makes invalid assumptions, presents spurious speculations and misrepresents uncontestable facts, as well as completely ignoring some aspects of recent researched observation. In spite of his (the author's) efforts to make my own (European) race feel guilty, I do not. I am proud to be white; after all, neither I nor my children are responsible for any past actions (on both sides) and find such blatant attempts to coerce the reader as dangerous as well as being extremely non-productive. This is not the way to encourage New Zealanders to look forward to the future. 
 Unfortunately, I was forced to read this book by my photography professor. Every word, every page, was sheer hell to struggle through. Trying to follow Barthe's chaotic train of thought is next to impossible. This book is full of navel-gazing gibberish that can only loosely be described as "English". He admits to not being a photographer, and goes on to claim photography itself doesn't exist. How then, did he write a whole monstrous book on photography? And moreover, why am I being subjected to it?  My heart is warmed somewhat when I read of Mr. Barthe's history. He spent a lifetime suffering from tuberculosis, and ended it splattered across the front of a van. Good. The bastard deserved it for what he's inflicted on hapless undergrads around the world. 
 I'm a retail stockbroker/financial planner.  The material is almost completely useless for retail brokers and most financial planners.  The material would mainly be usable by fee-only financial planners catering to  extremely wealthy individuals and wishing to take the author's  "concierge" approach to servicing clients.  For most retail  brokers, insurance agents, and most financial planners, the book contains  little of use; don't waste your money on it 
 This particular DVD edition of Nosferatu is an excellent example of the importance of music in setting a film's mood.  I'm not sure when this "score" was "written", although it is far from effective in depicting the time period of the film.  Nor does it convey the proper mood in many points during the film.  With this edition's music, I got confused at times between what I saw and what I heard, and the whole thing became an unaffective joke after a while.  If you want an affective, edge-of-the-seat experience out of Nosferatu, I reccomend another edition.  
 From the title of this book, I imagined that it would be something which I would read out of each night.  With such an image in my mind, I got this  book, but did not get past the first few pages. There are phrases such as  "horses have no conscience".  This made me thing that the author  had never been near a horse before 
 If the author had spent more time telling us about Detroit and less time telling us how literate he is then it would have been a lot better book 
 Sure, these colorful jewel cases are pretty to look at but I give their functionality an F. As soon as I opened one of these cases to put a CD in it, the case broke. It happened to 3 cases out of the 12 I have used already. I wasn't using excessive force, in fact most people call me gentle. Buy at your own risk and HANDLE WITH CARE! 
 This book was very disappointing. I would return it, had I kept the receipt. I was perplexed about why she didn't just focus on making a book about her love life. Maybe that would have been more interesting, but she hardly makes her French boyfriend sound the least bit important to her. I am an American young woman, so maybe I don't understand her humor. Most of the time I felt like the French had to put up with her, and her lack of sophistication,than the other way around. Yet another whiny book about someone living in Paris and complaining about it, which I find completely rude, and sort of seems to justify the French people's animosity towars Americans (though the author is more like the Brits) 
 It is only a historical book.There is no useful information for pagans 
 How this book ever made it to print is beyond me. Not one single recipe in it works...not one. It was a monumental waste of money and effort. Disappointing 
 I was looking forward to receiving this book but was disappointed.  It did not provide any more than a few visual cues on the artist's best known pieces.  I had hoped for notes on his start, inspirations, and other less  known pieces of artwork 
 If you're going to do an album consisting entirely of cover versions of well-known worship songs, then you need to give it some distinctiveness in order to make it stand out from the rest. But this doesn't - it's just a set of unoriginal and uninspiring carbon copies. There's nothing wrong with the choice of songs, but there's nothing distinctively Kutless about their presentation - this could have been created by a band of anonymous Nashville session musicians and it would have sounded exactly the same. It seems that the band checked their creativity out at the door when they went into the stuiod to make this one 
 The writing is very good, but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions:  Do I care about the characters?  Can I stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends?  If you answer no to the first question and yes to the second, it is not a good work of literature.  The Line of Beauty is, unfortunately, one of these novels.  Tedious, overly mannered and stifling 
 Now, I enjoy Victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person -- in fact, probably more than the next person, since the average "next person" hasn't ever read any. Tales of derring-do, adventures to unexplored distant lands, lost civilizations, great artifacts, etc. -- that's all good stuff. What's not good is this book, which is tedious in the extreme. On the surface of it, Haggard's followup to his hugely successful (and infinitely better) "King Solomon's Mines" has all the elements: a dynamic duo of scholar-adventurers (one of whom is descended from pharaohs!), a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man, an expedition to Africa, and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life.  However, despite this promising laundry list, Haggard's execution leaves a great deal to be desired. A friend described it rather aptly as "a book with a lot of story, but not a lot of plot." Which is to say that in my edition, some 320 pages are filled without much happening. There is the initial mysterious set-up, the journey to dark Africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations, the heroes' conveyance to the "lost city", and then... and then things kind of grind to a halt. Lengthy descriptive details, lengthy internal ruminations, lengthy rambling speeches, lengthy everything -- but very little of consequence occurs until the very end, when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh-everlasting life.  I suspect much of the problem stems from the book's origin as a long-running serial in the Gazette. As I understand it, serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment, and thus, it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible -- hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words. Judicious editing could reduce the book to 1/3 of its size without any loss of note. Of course, as another friend pointed out, it's probably best to read the book is small chunks -- just as one would have done with installments. Spreading out one's reading of it over a period of time, he suggests, may serve to conceal the book's rambling nature. In any event, there are some nice scenes here and there, such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches, but those are about all I'm likely to recall from this book in a year.   Of course, as is noted in the introduction to my edition, Haggard lifted the main elements of the plot, and even the the true name of "She-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named", from several earlier adventure novels by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, so one can't even give him much credit for imagination. I suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of Victorian Englishmen: racism, anti-Semeticism, misogyny, fear of miscegenation, etc., but as entertainment for the modern reader, it falls woefully short of the mark. 
 YO this album can be described in the simplest term - Garbage 
 The author lacks of moral clarity in the issue of the Middle East.  It seems that the only democracy in that region has the fault of everything. As Mr. Sharansky explain in his last book, "The power of Democracy.....", there is at least two  ways to know when something is anti-Semitic.  1) when someone compare attitudes as diabolic.  Ej: compare Israel politics as Nazis, or the way Israelis treats Palestinian as Auschwitz (Saramago). 2)  when someone like Mr. Swisher critics  the attitudes of a Nation o people, but says nothing about the same attitude in others country or people.  It seems in these books, that Palestinian terror does not exist, that suicide terrorist take places in another planet. And yes, despite the many interviews he made, witch are interesting in many cases, this book is anti-Semitic and anti Israel, with no sustainable bases.  
 I am a decades-long lover of Southern Living publications. Whether we buy the magazines, the cookbooks, or the home products, many of us count on Southern Living for unsurpassed quality and creativity.  I am extremely disappointed with "Christmas with Southern Living 2005". This edition marks the 25th Anniversary of this regularly phenomenal book. I can hardly believe this belongs in the same category as the volumes from previous years.   Certainly, the color photography remains true to form, wonderfully presented. But it's the sheer lack of creative craft ideas, and the fewer number of quality recipe ideas that mar this normally fantastic book. I was expecting a five-star product for the silver anniversary - what I fear I've received is far below what SL should have offered.  I expect CwSL 2006 to make up for what 2005's edition was lacking - this company will most certainly not let us down again. I'll continue to buy Southern Living books without hesitation - and with excitement! I'm simply disappointed that the 2005 book will find its way to the back of the bookcase 
 I've really enjoyed the past books in this series but this one was a big disappointment. The story line was severly lacking and the political and social issues the author included were misplaced. Even though I agree with most of the authors views, I didn't like the way they were forced into the story and were so out of character with the prior books in the series.  
 I was so excited and thought that I at last would get some good well founded answers or at least questions. I didn't. The book is full of quotes from the movies, and even the game 'path of neo'. I have seen the trilogy several times and still I am puzzled, wondering where this philosophy has its roots. Although the philosophy isn't new but a collection of a vast number of questions asked during decades, centuries and millennias, a structured and well written book about this neverending topic must exist? You won't find them in this book as it splinters its own pages more than it splinters your mind. However, if you wonder what the trilogy gives you, you'll get plenty of answers. 
 I downloaded the player and this episode as part of a promotion that gave a free episode. Not only did I get charged, but when I cancelled the download to contact about the charge - I was told I had to finish downloading before they could refund. Once it finished downloading, it didn't play anyway. I gave up. 
 This is by far the worst book I've ever read. I still really can't tell if this is written for children or if the author is just pulling our legs.  We are beaten over the head with the obviouse constantly.  I won't "give  away" the ending but suffice it to say all the characters show up that  you would expect to be present in an apocalyptic tale.  The authors secret  is to take a cliche, magnify it 100 fold and then beat you over the head  with it. Still, I did finish the book because quite frankly I had to see  how bad it could get. I was not dissappointed. If you've never watched a  movie just because you couldn't believe it was so aweful then you may not  see the beauty in this book 
 I got the cd with only disc 2...it was unopened and had 2 copies of disc two it was rediculus...im happy onme of my friends could make me a copy of the first one... 
 This book is just a clever rehash of his other books but just repackaged under "POWER AGING". Some of his books contain the title Gary Null Phd. and other books just say Gary Null- so this time it is "Phd"- the book jackets NEVER say from what University. Many of the supplements pluged in Null's book are sold by his company Gary Null Associates so it is hard not to look at this book as just another product placement. The idea that hundreds of  millions of people of diverse cultures should eat a specific way is ludicrous. Gary Null writes his book as if he has all the information, but scientists still do not have much of the answers regarding aging, yet Gary gives the impression he knows everything there need to know about health and mega- antioxidants may become pro-oxidants in the body. He sounds like the Jim Jones of health gurus. Gary Null knows that his diet is nearly impossible to follow for the normal average person working 8 to 6 pm 5 or 6 days a week and he creates products that fill the need. Instead of eating all those lbs. of organic vegetables and fruit each day just take his expensive concentrates and supplements and watch Gary Inc. get richer. CASE IN POINT: FOR OVER 30 YEARS GARY CLAIMED THAT CHOCOLATE WAS TOXIC AND AS BAD AS CONSUMING MEAT OR COFFEE-NOW HE SELLS A 'NUTRITIOUS" GARY NULL CHOCOLATE BAR!   
 The lady can sing, but her "Christian" message is compromised because of her part in "Chasing Papi", where she played a woman who - had she had the chance - would have hopped into bed with her on-screen boyfriend prior to marriage.  It's "Crystal Clear" to me that Jaci broke my heart in a million pieces when she played that part.  It's really tragic to see such a beautiful young lady with such a opowerful voice and message now reduced to nothing more than a hypocritical wannabee, much in the same way that Stacie Orrico is now becoming.....and is it just me, or is it coincidence that these two womens' album covers look strikingly similar?  It appears their paths in life are similar, too: compromising a message and a stand that once set them worlds apart.  As with a recent review of Orrico that I made, I'll give Jaci Velasquez her due:  she can sing, and what I mean by that is sing the roof off of a house!  This album was excellent.....was.  Now, whenever I think or hear of Jaci Velasquez, I can only think one word:  HYPOCRITE 
 I haven't read the book but I am about to buy it so this isn't a review it's just a comment on the other reviews.  I don't know exactly how the writing linked Taoism and Ninjutsu as I haven't read the book. I just wanted to say this isn't the first time I have heard of this.   It was in one of either of these two books I can't remember which (I would bet on the first):  Mind Manipulation The Ninja - Steven Hayes  They discuss the development of alot of the psychoogical aspects from the Taoist 5 elements and there was a reference to some "5 element ninjas." There was even a Japanese word for them.  I remember this clearly coz at the time I was doing XIng Yi Luihe a Taoist art with the 5 elements at its heart. Also the 5 element ninja idea sounded cool.  I am not concluding anything...just offering a bit of info in passing.  PS. My rating was just to try and not mess up the rating by others. 
 You can only ride for 45 minutes after charging the battery for 12 hours. Forget about buying an extra battery to charge while you ride, because of the adapter it only charges while its on  the machine. There is no seperate battery charger. 
 The sound quality is really awful!! I gave it a two star, because I give credit to the other aspects of the product like the casing, the gooseneck support, and the fact that it is easy to turn it back on when it loses its power.  HOwever, the most important thing is the sound quality, which really is very, very poor 
 Not having read any of Vonnegut's work for 30 years, I opened A Man Without a Country and remembered why I'd SO assiduously avoided him. As a natural conservative I much enjoy the thrust and parry of lively political debate. But KV, like almost every socialist I've ever met, doesn't do debate, preferring mockery, innuendo, myth and wilfully distorted facts. It's the superior sneer of the self-styled intellectual who doesn't know what he's talking about. His unwavering belief in doctrinal socialism brings to mind a line from Emerson: "Foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds."  His defence of Marx, beginning with religion being the opium rather than the opiate of the masses demonstrates his willingness to distort language. That he then manages to blend the benefits of Marxist ideology with the evils of slavery left me moderately bemused. (The American Indian, who cause he champions, was something of a proto-Marxist and quite happily used slaves.) His obsession with slavery and the inference that the United States was uniquely guilty of it is symptomatic of historical revisionism at its most banal. Slavery is a millennia-old, worldwide phenomenon, with a reasonable chance that most of us have distant ancestors who suffered it. But during the period he's most exercised about villainous white slavers didn't mount raids into the interior of Africa, they purchased stock from coastal chieftains who enjoyed vast profits from the sale of fellow Africans. And who, after parliament made not just the trade but the ownership of slaves illegal in Britain, wrote letters of howling protest to the crown that the new law was going to ruin them. Just as Vonnegut ignores the complicity of Africans in the trade, he also omits that it was white European stock that lobbied against and eventually outlawed what had existed in Africa long before the arrival of the first Portuguese explorers, and continued long after it was banned by European and North American governments (or that it still exists amongst the Arabs and West Africans today). Unsurprisingly, he overlooks the enslavement of over a million white Europeans by Barbary corsairs between 1500 and the mid-1800s. Spain and the Italian city states suffered the greatest depredations, but the North African raiders seized thousands of Irish, Cornish and Welsh and not an insignificant number of colonial American seamen. (See Christian slaves, Muslim Masters, Robert Davis, Palgrave MacMillan, 2003)  Vonnegut decries the "135,000" deaths in the bombing of Dresden, deliberately ignoring that German academics now put the figure at closer to 30,000. Which is bad enough, but ol' Kurt not only prefers the discredited number, but makes no mention of the 60,000 British civilians killed between 1940 and 1945 by German bombs, V1s and V2s.  His horror over the deaths of some 200,000 in Hiroshima and Nagasaki doesn't include the 300,000 deaths in Nanking to Japanese bullet, bayonet, gang rape, and burning or burying alive, or the three million Chinese who died during the invasion and occupation of their country by Imperial troops. Or that Allied soldiers, PoWs, and enslaved Asian labourers were dying at the hands of the Japanese right up to the day after that big flash over Nagasaki. Balance is not one of Kurt's strengths.  Comparing Americans with Nazis ("And with good reason.") is simply fatuous. Not even the most virulently anti-Bush liberal leftie hyperventilates at the prospect of the USA invading Luxembourg or Andorra.  "Our president is a Christian?" Kurt asks. "So was Adolf Hitler." In fact, Hitler had the same disdain for religion as Marx had. The future Greater Germany was to be religion-free.  His many references to the evil of oil might have at least a hint of resonance if I knew this great sage hasn't driven a car, used the subway, boarded a commercial flight, or used an electrical appliance that wasn't powered by his own wind-driven generator in the last 30 years.   And then...oh hell, there are so many more examples of the woe-is-me-a-lone-voice-in-the-wilderness-that-knows-how-evil-America is. Vonnegut belongs to that genre of Western self-loathers who have benefited enormously from the capitalist system they hate. You'd think he might have considered settling in Sweden. Maybe he was put off by the socialist tax rate he'd have to pay.  
 This thing just doesn't work, don't bother.  It won't stay upright no matter what you do, so there's no way for the kids to play any form of tether ball with it.  Looks like it would be fun if it worked.  The most entertaining thing about it was that the dog kept barking at it for some reason. 
 When I first got the Portable Dvd player I charged the battery and when I inserted a dvd and after a few minutes it would freeze and skip certain parts of the movie. I tried to restart it and tried other dvds and it kept saying "Wrong Disc". So anyone who is looking to get this Portable dvd player I advice you not to becuase it will cause a lot of problems and its just going to be a waste of money 
 This book had all the hallmarks of a diet memoir: it was self-indulgent, solipsistic, whiny and asinine. After reading it I ate a pint of Haagen Dazs Vanilla and decided that I blame nobody but myself. It was liberating. I am so sick of people who sit around name-dropping and blame everybody--their mother, their sister, their friends--for their fat butts. The worst part of this book was that it wasn't even well-written! Courtney should quit her day job. 
 I hope the ending is illogical at least and is fiction. If thoughts are that powerful, they need to be resrained earlier. I don't know who survivied but he might feel very guilty about the others earlier and question if he had to survive. Logic can be quite painful when left alone, but sometimes it has to be 
 This ain't hot at all. He get 2 stars just for trying and he saved. If you want to hear REAL Christian hip hop Please check out Lecrae, DA T.R.U.T.H.,116 Clique: The Compilation Album, Sean Slaughter, Mr Del, Trip Lee, Tedashii, and Flame. Any of these cd's will make you throw this one away. I'm sorry but I gotta keep it Real 
 I found the heroine (ZD) so flatly written that she could only come off as a selfish, flightly idiot. She never has a chance to be a real person nor to have any real character.  To anyone reading today, with any smattering of enlightenment, I believe Zulieka Dobson will be frustrating and annoying.  She's set up to make a mean-spirited point.  I suggest picking up Evelyn Waugh or Nancy Mitford to get some fine writing on the society of the between-war period and the English upper classes 
 I read tons and tons of reviews of this product and decided to take a chance on it.  Well that chance did not pay off.  Even in combination with the spray model my cat continued to spray everywhere.  If anyone else has ideas for something that does work i would really appreciate it.  
 I received this book for Christmas and was annoyed by the writing style within the first 50 pages.  The story itself isn't bad, but I found the writing styles simplistic and like I said before, annoying.  The four main characters have no chemistry.  They are supposed to be the best of friends but you never feel any emotion out of any of them.  The same phrases are also uttered over and over and over again.  Here these people are, on the brink of something magical and amzing that they have found that will turn the world on the edge and all you hear constantly uttered out of one of the character's mouth is, "I sure wish I knew."    Hey look, I can't believe it, how did those people build gateways to other worlds?  Boy, I sure wish I knew.  Hey!  Look at that amazing and terrifying flying insect, how does it fly with such small wings?  I sure wish I knew.  Maybe I expected too much of this book since I don't read sci-fi only.   But as I said, I could hardly finish this book much less read anything else written in this style.  What a shame = 
 I have to wonder why Robin felt the need to release this album. It is a collection of Bee Gees songs but Barry was not consulted about the album or selections of songs. Is Robin in need of money that he continues to throw the same songs out to fans? How many copies of these hits do we really need to own?   I don't understand why some songs would even be considered 'love' songs and why solo releases if it is called a Bee Gees album? I thought the cover was strange that it didn't contain a picture of the Bee Gees, maybe because Robin failed yet again to consult his brother, but wants fans to believe it was a joint effort. Sorry Robin, but fans know it wasn't. If Barry had been involved, he would have mentioned it on his web site plus offered the album for fans to buy. The lack of show on Barry's site shows fans once again you have tried to mislead people and just fatten your wallet.  I hope for all Bee Gees fans that Robin gets over his anger at his big brother and realizes that he just isn't capable of doing it on his own.    As for this album, why waste your money! Get out a blank CD and make your own album, I guarantee you will come up with a better song selection and look at all the money you have saved.  
 Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law.  I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive  and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read.  His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point.  I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter. 
 It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I  gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through 
 I have found that this cable does not fit snugly to maintain a good connection. It tends to wiggle part of the way out rather easily.  The zip cord function is disappointing.  It worked for a little while, but it didn't take long for it not to function properly.  After only a few uses it doesn't roll all the way back up nor does it want to stay unrolled most of the time.  
 This book has an impressive reference list occupying 57 pages, but in the attempt to cover everything it leaves you with almost nothing useful. It is about the most painful book I have read since my quantum physics textbook back in university. It is poorly written and has virtually no diagrams or visual display of concepts which would be a welcome addition in the 340 pages of 8 pitch font text. I would skip this one 
 This is a made for TV movie and not the original film. Do not waste your money on this re-make. Buy the original that was released in 1967 and starred Robert Blake 
 Many reviewers on this site read TLGPE in the 70's, when we were young and impressionable. (I happened to be 13 when I read it.) If one could be sued for intellectual forgery, Lindsey would certainly be found at fault.  Most of us, thankfully, have gotten past our fears that plagued our teenage years. After all, when we read TLGPE, we were young. We were searching and seeking. We didn't have all of the facts. There were wolves who knew this, and they preyed upon us. Many people who were older, yet still intellectually undeveloped, read this book and were moved to 'believing'.  For most of us, our minds matured. We began to see the vast chinks in Lindsey's pompous Christian armor. We began to realize that fear is a weapon brandished by madmen, by people who use a subtle, gentle cloth of manipulation to control others.  This is beyond dangerous. It is beyond extreme, as most of us have now found out.  I love a good horror novel. I love a good 'true crime' thriller. But the fact that people read Lindsey's books and take them at face value is, perhaps, one of the scariest notions I have ever imagined.  That, dear reader, is beyond horrific . . . and far more terrifying than anything you'll find in the bible or any of Lindeys 'books'. The only thing scarier is that Mr. Lindsey is still receiving royalties from an outdated, silly, contradictory and completely barbaric book penned over thirty years ago. Please don't be the next sucker. Please don't add this one to your cart.  
 The description says deluxe but it is the economy quality material with painted designs on the shirt. If you're on a budget, this costume will suffice. I searched the web and found Amazon with the best price for the DELUXE anakin costume and was disappointed that I never got the deluxe as it was advertised. I ended up purchasing the real deluxe Anakin costume from a different site. I was kind of surprised that this happened because my other Amazon purchases have always been exactly what I ordered 
 Why are Americans so fat? According to this dope, it's because of fast food. Which is an easy way to shift the blame from ourselves, our laziness, and our lac of discipline and blame those mean corporations for offering us all sorts of alternatives that we can accept or decline. Gee, I wish Mommy Government would outlaw unhealthy foods and unhealthy portions! Then everything would be right with the world; after all, no government has ever consolidated power over its people and then abused them. Right? People shouldn't have to make decisions for themselves! It's not fair to ask us to use our brains and decide what's best for ourselves. Someone else should take responsibility so we can just sit around watching television shows and playing on the Internet 
 It's hard to believe that the same scholar who wrote The American Century and Imagining the Law is the same expert that Anne Rice claims as her foremost source of medieval history. Norman Cantor's breadth of knowledge (and the varying degrees of it, covering everything from sweeping historical movements to epicurean minutiae) is truly incredible, and I find myself amazed by his attention to detail time and time again, whether he is dealing with the relationship between Einstein's theories and Cubism or the origin of the popularity of Madeira port in England.    Encyclopedic knowledge, however, does not necessarily yield an interesting biography.  Cantor attempts to do so in this book about John of Gaunt, the first Duke of Lancaster.  On the surface, it seems that it would be almost impossible to write a dull biography of John of Gaunt. The richest man in Europe who was not a king, a commander in the Hundred Years War, the father of Henry IV, the grandfather of Henry the Navigator, the benefactor of Geoffrey Chaucer and, briefly, John Wyclif - John of Gaunt appears as the apex of the high medieval era, a thinking man's warrior who lived life extravagantly and yet strictly abided by the chivalric code.  In William Manchester's hands, John of Gaunt would have been a sensational character indeed.  What deadens the presentation of such a colorful figure here, however, is that Cantor chooses to tell his story by using what he calls the "sociological approach."  I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it seems to be an appropriate description of the way in which Cantor uses the figure of Gaunt to illuminate different sectors of society.  Thus, by setting the military, financial, and romantic activities of Gaunt within their proper context, Cantor feels free to discuss the economic and political activities of the serfs and knights whose lives were circumscribed by Gaunt's power and influence.  We are also introduced to the royal families of England, Spain and Portugal, all of which included at least one member of Gaunt's immediate family.  However, despite the fact that Gaunt plays a key role in the war with France, the Peasant's Revolt, Richard II's fall from power, and, unwittingly, the institutionalization of racism (through the ideology constructed by Henry the Navigator), Cantor's Gaunt comes across as a typical billionaire, whose interests and occasional forays into philanthropy suggest a life as lavish and boring as today's CEOs who catch the public's attention only when their infidelities or swindles rise to the surface.     Furthermore, Cantor has an unsettling habit of numbering his points ("first of all...second of all...") which can give the narrative the feel of a textbook.  The only really interesting bits occur when Cantor suddenly slips into strange flights of fancy, such as when he composes an unintentionally hilarious imaginary love letter that Gaunt might have sent to his mistress, Catherine Swynford.  By the end of the book, John of Gaunt, poised at the edge of an era and facing the rumblings of social change with growing trepidation, fossilizes into the "aged, doddering" man of Shakespeare's play Richard II - the very representation that Cantor wanted to subvert when he decided to bring this man to life 
 I didn't think this was that great.  I read this in one night and I was not impressed at all 
 I had looked forward to reading this book. Alas, there is something that is not quite right with it. First of all, McAmis' definition of Malay is quite misleading. His definition is a bit too liberal and too broad. Malay first and foremost in today's terminological use refers to Malays in Malaysia. While some Malays in Malaysia are likely to see Southern Filipinos, Indonesians, etc as their distant kinsmen, they're not very likely to call them Malays. 'Malay' is very strictly defined in legal terms in Malaysia. To broaden this definition as McAmis does is akin to saying that Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians, Laotians are all 'essentially' Chinese. Apart from that, McAmis' research into Islamism in SEA isn't too illuminating. Judith Nagata has, in her essays, done a much better job. She has written about the dakwah movement and given such details that I am, as a Malaysian, completely amazed by how much she managed to ferret out of these communities 
 Last march (2002) i bought this camera and it was wonderful, although it was "refurbished" by CANON it worked perfectly. I bought also a new battery and a 48MB Compactflash memory card and everything was working fine. 6 months later the camera had electrical problems and warranty had expired. Now the cost to fix this problem is far bigger than to buy a new camera because warranty period for "refurbished" items is less than 6 months 
 One of those cases where everything goes wrong in the making of a movie: low budget, unispired performances (Alexis Denisof is particularly bad here), lack of decent screenplay for the actors to work upon, bad direction, despisable characters, cliched situations... How Kinski chose to act in this one? 
 I was expecting a thoughtful assessment of the challenges that lie ahead.  What I got was the musings of a bitter old man who seems to hate everything about contemporary American society and is cheering for its imminent demise.  I knew the book wasn't going to be cheery or optimistic, but this was way too depressing.  I don't need this kind of nay-saying pessimisim in my life 
 Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs. 
 I bought this cookbook thinking it was persian cooking.  I certainly did not expect to see recipes for Italian dishes and dumbed down american dishes.  I wouldn't even say these are recipes - things like dumping a can of cream of mushroom soup with other things is not cooking in my mind.  This is neither persian cooking or american cooking - it's a disgrace to people who enjoy the art of either.  I'm returning the book.  I'd give this 0 stars, but unfortunately, Amazon doesn't have that option 
 I have had this system for 9 monthis now, and I am sure this is the worst piece of AV equipment I have ever owned.  Sony is usually known for quality products, but it this case I am afraid they rested on their laurels and delivered a poorly designed and poorly manufactured piece of equipment to the market.  The worst part is that I have had numerous problems with it.  Occasionaly it fails to recognize CD/DVD inserted after you turn it off and back on.  On other occasions it completely locks up.  The first time it happened I had to call Sony customer support and find out the secret combination of buttons to press to unlock it. Now, after about 9 months of use, it has taken on a habit of completely shutting down with a message "PROTECT UNPLUG".   The only way to bring it back to life is to unplug it and plug it back in after a few minutes.  There is nothing wrong with my electric wiring -- I have checked, and the system is plugged into a fairly expensive surge protector/power conditioner.  I am not sure whether to go through the trouble of fixing it -- at this point it's just not worth it because of all the other things I despise about this system.    First off, CDs and DVDs take forever to load.  To insert a disk one has to press an "Eject" button and then listen carefully for about two minutes while the system rearranges itself and lets you finally insert the disk.  If you missed your chance -- tough luck, start all over.  Second, it is a royal pain to use -- any configuration apart from the basic settings is as convoluted as it can possbly be.  On screen menus, a standard on most systems, now do not exist, and the manual is a joke. Third, the FM radio is awful.  I went out and spent money on an expensive FM antenna -- still, my cheap clock radio gets better reception.  Fourth, there are other annoying little things about this system which are too numerous to list in this review.    Finally, I don't share people's opinion that the sound is all that great.  It's average.  Out-of-the-box it is way too heavy on bass.  The wireless feature is nice -- I admit, and that was the reason I bought it.  But I would not buy it again (or probably another piece of Sony equipment) in a million years now.  I could live with wires running around my room, or even just a two-speaker system rather than deal with this piece of junk. Shame on Sony for slapping their name on this lemon.    
 Our entire book club disliked this book. We had a hard time feeling a connection to the characters. Howard, the largest presence in this story, feels like a blank at the core. Upon putting this book down, his motivations and what might be in his heart were still a mystery to me. Characters such as Jerome, Victoria, and Carl were intriguingly introduced, but then inconsistently treated for the rest of the text. Especially Carl - he just disappears - no resolution to his story at all. As am homage to Howard's End, some of the parallels were not strongly enough underscored to flesh out this book for me. For example, the heart-to-heart connection between Kiki Belsey and Carlene Kipps does not jump off the page at you the way the connection between Margaret Schlegel and Mrs. Wilcox did.   I thought Zora was one of the most interesting characters, and I like how Smith contrasted her obviously high intelligence and intellectual arrogance with her social awkwardness and sexual insecurity. But Smith makes her smug a bit too often, and so feeling a connection with Zora is difficult as well - most of the time I just wanted to smack her. And I have to agree with the others that Smith needs to brush up on her American characterizations. There was next to no authenticity in that regard. Especially the Southern dialogue - laughable!  It also feels like Smith had a hard time figuring out how to end this book...I understand that end is supposed to be a beginning of sorts...but the fact that there were so many plot threads left dangling, unresolved, by the last page just gave me a feeling of incomplete-ness.   Aaaargh...must go and re-read Howard's End to dispell the queasy feeling left by On Beauty 
 Reading the title and description of this book, I was excited about reading it. I found the writing not up to the task! Despite having a great deal of interest in the subject, after scanning the book I decided not to read it 
 The description for these dishes is wrong! There is nothing Pewter, black or gray in color on them. The stripes are light and dark BROWN and the rest is a mottled BROWN. 
 Got one as a Christmas present - great concept, but the performance falls well short of the promise.  As another reviewer noted, wine from my wine fridge (56 deg.) registered as 74 deg. when placed into the unit; wine at room temp (72 deg.) regularly registered 78 deg. or so.  Although the unit ran through it's cycle and indicated wine had been chilled to the proper temperature it never was.  In fact, if you put the bottle back into the unit immediately and started it again it would register a temperature about 10 degrees warmer than it had indicated just seconds earlier.  I tried about half-a-dozen times over a couple days, but it never worked properly.  We returned the unit to the store for credit 
 I kept complaining all through the book that it was trite, boring and vague.  My husband asked me why I kept reading it.  Not being one to give up until the last page, I forged ahead and finished.  Sorry to report it  didn't get any better.  I'm not much of a fan of fiction though...so read  it at the risk of wasting your time 
 Joel Osteen almost never mentions the word "sin."  He's so popular because he tells people what they want to hear.  As for the book, it's garbage.  He says to stop thinking only about yourself and start thinking about others.  But the whole book is about thinking about yourself.  He says that you should be happy with what you do have rather than what you don't have.  But the entire book focuses on getting what you don't have.  He says Christians can get what they want by just visualizing and saying that they will get those things.  Does anyone other than Osteen actually believe that?  What about Christians who live in Rwanda, San Salvador and other poverty-stricken parts of the world?  Or does that way of thinking only apply in affluent societies?  He says Christians deserve special treatment.  But try acting that way at work or at a store and see how much others like you for it.  Don't read this book 
 Very disappointed with the DVD quality, it is even worse than any new VHS tapes. Even at the first time I played it, some part was not able to play. I wish the DVD/CD purchasing policy covered the case how to handle defect DVD/CD. Contents do cover a lot bellet movements 
 Mark Twain once said that (and I paraphrase)the definition of a classic is something that everyone wants to have read and no one wants to read. That is my experience with this book. For some reason, A Tale of Two Cities never made it onto any of my high school reading lists, and I figured it was one of those books I should have under my belt. So I picked it up. What a slog! A book that might have been fascinating due to its French Revolution subject matter was a mass of rambling descriptions and melodrama. We were supposed to shed tears for Sidney Carton, a character who you barely get to know, and root for Lucie Manette...the highly unrealistic paragon of unspoiled goodness. The only thing I liked about this book was how Madame Defarge knitted a list of people on which she planned to take revenge. An admittedly cool concept. Maybe this book speaks to another era, maybe it's past its prime, maybe I don't have the required literary sensibilities, or maybe I couldn't relate, but A Tale of Two Cities bored me to tears. 
 I think some of the other reviewers are being too kind to Pretty Girls Make Graves on this album.  They have apparently abandoned their more melodic, interesting songs in favor of simple, boring dance-pop.  To make matters worse, they aren't even really very good at dance-pop.  Maybe the popularity of bands like Bloc Party has influenced them too much.  The album could have been saved if it had been recorded better and performed with any amount of energy and enthusiasm.  It sounds like it was recorded in a closet.  This is probably one of the most disappointing releases that I've ever purchased, I'm sorry to say.  Anyone looking for good Pretty Girls Make Graves records should purchase either "Good Health" or "The New Romance" because they are both great records.  I can only hope that they return to their own style and put out some better records in the future 
 I bought the med. and XL size beds for my 2 dogs.  They both had about the same amount of stuffing making the medium bed nice and fluffy, but the extra large bed is flat and the stuffing moves around so much inside it my dog ends up lying on the hard floor with the stuffing out at the edges.  Trying to wash them was another headache!  The first time i opened the medium bed to wash it, the zipper came apart (it wasn't fastened together at the end so the pull came right off) and cannot be fixed!  I had to permanently sew it together to keep my dog from pulling at it and chewing on the edges=fixed the problem, but now impossible to wash.  Also the interior did not hold up in the dryer.  Even on low heat the lining melted and stuffing was everywhere! Again i had to sew the holes together.  I will say that the beds' covers are attractive (i ordered the suede paw print) and the hair vacuums off of them nicely.  But i will never order these beds again when they need to be replaced, which will now be sooner than originally anticipated 
 This is quite a book.  Cannon admits that he is fascinated by Reagan (p. ix), but it seems to be the fascination of sadist.  It is obvious that he does not like Reagan, and the chapter layout proves this.  For example, Regan's earliest and most decisive victory, the firing of the ATC Worker, is achronologically treated in Chapter 17, which is on the relection.  He devotes an entire (and very tedious) chapter to Regan's visit to Bitburg Cemetery (Chapter 18), and then two whole chapters to Iran-Contra (19-20). The weirdest mix may be Chapter 8, begins a discussion of Reagan's humor and then deteriorates into a discussion of Reagan's mental processes.  Moreover, he devotes one and a half paragraphs on page 91 to discuss the assassination attempt, and does not even mention John Hinckley by name, which he finally does on page 156 and later on page 164, in the context of Alex Haig's meltdown.  This is tantamount to writing a biography on Lincoln, and paraphrasing the Gettysburg Address.  I thought Chapter 8, "Kidding on the Square" paled in comparison to Peggy Noonan's similar treatment in "When Character Was King," Chapter 14.  Cannon includes two of Reagan's off-color jokes that Noonan only alludes to, which just reveals more of his iconoclasm.  This books biggest flaw is that there is no Reagan in it.  It is almost all context to Reagan, but you see very little of the man.  You get exposed to people's reactions to Reagan, but never given inside the man.  This is because Cannon rarely quotes Reagan himself.  He manages to talk around his subject, with nimble dexterity, but four chapters into the book, you get the feeling something is missing.  BEFORE YOUR READ THIS BOOK, I suggest you read three others.  First, Read Michael Reagan's quote book on his father, "In the Words of Ronald Reagan."  The second would be "Speaking My Mind," Reagan's collection of his favorite speeches.   Given in chronological order, they give you a better sense of what happened, what Reagan himself thought was important bout his presidency. This gives you a better sense of time that Canon obscures (i.e. talking about the ATC strike in the same chapter as his reelection-quite a Wrinkle in Time).  The last would be the aforementioned Noonan biography, which is really a moral history of the man.  Then tackle Cannon's book and see his flaws 
 Fiction doesn't get any more shallow than this, and don't let anyone kid you that it's a satiric comedy of manners. Gossipy name dropping and bed hopping may entertain Grazer's crowd but anyone with a brain is going to get turned off quickly. The book is a complete waste of time and money. I stopped reading after the first 10 pages. Yuck 
 I'm struggling through Shadow of the Giant. Normally when I read a book, I read the entire thing in as close to one sitting as possible. Giant is taking me a while - a chapter at a time, and I'm only halfway through after several months, and have no particular motivation to pick it up at any given point in time.   It reads like a plot outline, not a novel. Nearly every scene is "tell" and not "show." The characters are plot devices instead of real people. It just doesn't pull me in the way Ender's Game, Speaker for the Dead, and Ender's Shadow did. It's like reading through a textbook. "This happened, and this person did this, and that person did that, and here's why." With occasional bits of dialogue thrown in here and there that didn't necessarily show off the most important parts of the scene.  I don't think this should have been published as-is. It's a draft, not a finished novel. And considering just how long the draft was, when almost all of the scenes - written out properly - could've been 3-5 times their present lengths, this could've either been the outline for multiple books, or it needed a lot of pruning 
 The munition book is a false representation of true munitions.  It contain dangerous mixtures to kill the user.  And the intention is to commit murder. Amazon is guilty of supporing the "approved" munition reference.  Every injury is to cause the manual originators and Amazon executives a true reprizal.   Sidon  
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 I borrowed this from my sister-in-law to read. It is the first Barr book I have read.  I did not like it because of several reasons.  First of all, THE VULGAR LANGUAGE was too much.   One can write a fantastic thriller without words that are in the gutter.   Second, it was so mundane for a mystery.  The writer could have made this a very interesting book with the setting being in Yellowstone National Park.   Someone needs to give me a book of Barr's to prove that she can write an interesting book using words that are common to our daily language instead of trash talk. (By that I mean words one would use in professions of integrity.)  
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I've gone through three of these now and I've never gotten it to look like it does in the pictures. All that happens is that roots grow out of the bottom. My cat does sometimes eat parts of the roots, so I'm wondering if maybe she eats the grass before it can grow, but even so, I've never even seen a single blade of grass, only roots 
 I saw this book at a friend's shortly after seeing the movie.  I asked her if I could borrow it.  She said I wouldn't want to.  She'd been trying to read it for awhile, and didn't like it.  I decided to try anyway.  Unfortunately, my friend was right.  This is a definite case of a movie being much better than a book.  I really liked the movie.  However, the book is too long and boring.  There are so many tangents in it that have nothing to do with the central story.  I can't believe I even finished it.  Rent the movie-don't waste your time on the book 
 I have no idea what the folks who highly rated this book were reading/thinking. This is not a good book about the 1906 SF earthquake. All over the map with useless info, particularly the post-earthquake SF government graft trials. This last info was pointless, long, boring and was never tied in by the author to either the 1906 earthquake or the direction of SF government since then. Stilted writing. Not an enjoyable read 
 The songs selected for this collection are great, rousing classics, but the producers of the CD series decided to overdub stadium crowd noise over most of the songs, completely ruining the original songs!!!  Don't buy this if you want the pure songs in their original state.. 
 very hard to read, very expensive for what it is. I buy this book for a course of telecommunication, and i dont use it because it is really bad! I sold this book right after i finish the course 
 As other have stated, the performance is excellent.  My wife and I watched this in vegas and thoroughly enjoyed the show.  With that said, my review is for the extremely poor job the video editor did. They used some kind of filter on many of the shots.  They change camera angles 50 times in 1 minute to the point that is unbearable and painful to watch.  You do not get to see the dancers perform any full steps because the angle switches before they finish it.  Additionally they use these slow motion segments that totally ruin the moment and create the unsynchronized dance with the music.  I have to sell my copy because I get nauseas watching it.  I hope they re-make this DVD.  I think my 7-year old daughter could do a better job editing...and we could use the additional revenue stream... 
 I chose this book for my book club because I had read Erdrich's other novel, The Master Butcher's Singing Club, which was flawed, but still great reading.  I was so disappointed in this novel.  It did not meet my expectations.  I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly.  The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la "Weekend at Bernie's."  Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say. I am less inclined to try her other novels after reading this one.  
 shouldn't a "masterpiece" of comedy be ... i don't know ...   funny 
 I expected this book to be a satire comparing the ridiculous actions of some wealthy people to similar behaviors found in the animal kingdom. When the book sticks to its satirical purpose it somewhat succeeds, though I didn't find Conniff as funny as all the blurbs describing his "wittiness' would suggest.  But where I had a problem with this book is its one-sided perspective on human behavior, which Conniff attempts to explain through the very narrow lens of "biology as destiny." Now don't get me wrong, I definitely believe in Darwin's theory of evolution and the other basic ideas of science that have been proven through the "scientific method" of serious research and collected evidence. But, as most people would agree, BOTH nature and nuture play a part in human development. In other words both culture and biology are important factors in why humans behave as we do. This, to me, is common sense. But Conniff comes across as overly ideological in his biologically deterministic perspective. This is especially the case when he takes his jabs at feminists and others with a more "culturally based" point of view. I think there is much to be learned about humanity from studying the sciences. But I also believe in drawing from other ideas and academic disciplines in order to form a balanced basis of knowledge. Conniff fails to do that and for that reason I find his book does not ring true.  
 The film would have made a better spoof then trying to come off as a serious Bond flick.  From the opening scence where we have Bond and a couple associates ride a monster wave to the car chase on a sheet of ice it is all too much. I would love to purchase a vehicle that does not sopin out on pure ice. Where can I get one? Note how Bond gets wet several times in teh film, yet his hair is always perfect.   I agree with another review on this page, the scene of Bond parasailing on a big wave is a joke and an embarrassment to Bond fans.  Halie Berry is as bad as it gets. Even though she looks good she is such a poor actress I can't enjoy watching her. Perhaps if she just kept her month shut it would work for me.  A big disappointment that Bond did not bed Madonna. There is just something about her that makes it work for me. 
 Not that the music is bad but its a little to soft DJ Cam in most parts.  If you like light jazz sort of beats then you'll really enjoy this, but as apposed to most of Spookys other beats its really on the light side.  Asphalt and Parachutes are 2 tracks of special mention.  The former is a nice piece of trippy hip hop while the later has a really funky groove 
 You would think things would be a paradise in S. Africa if you listened to the Danny Glovers and other Black racists in the world.   So, why is S. Africa degenerating even with all the outpouring of money and business given to them once they became Politically Correct?   Hmmmm.   Mandela was a terrorist.   He could have been a free man if only he renounced violence and he choose not to - what does that tell you?   Look at the pictures of the Church Street bombings which he signed off for.   What a whitewash of History.   Disgusting 
 I had ordered this product originally hoping for a good quality portable dvd player.  This product is defintely portable and the screen being small was not a bad picture, but after having this product for a day I found that the power supply that came with it for charging the battery and also allowing you to plug directly in the electrical outlet was faulty. It would shut off for no apparent reason and when I played with the connection and was able to get it running again I had to start from the beginning with what I was watching.  I returned this item in hopes that I had just received a bad one, unfortunately the replacement I received did the exact same thing.  
  Clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist [...] fail to see it for exactly what is; an endorsement of Ethnic cleansing. If the tables were turned and a Jew, or a Muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with Judaism, or Islam was BRUTALLY MURDERED than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s**t. I do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist Lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage, or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of HATEFUL FILTH!! 
 this pillow offers no back support when nursing a baby.  i bought a brest friend instead.  you can attach that pillow to you and focus on helping your baby nurse instead of supporting your babies entire body.  pass up the boppy 
 One thing that one needs to be aware of is that this does NOT charge Dell batteries, and therefore can't really be used as a replacement for a Dell adapter.  I suggest you skip this overpriced item and just purchase a Dell charger (1/3 the price as well).  Also, it seems to run quite hot--I've been warned that too much use might fry my motherboard 
 This was a fine machine until 2 months after the warranty ran out.  Then I began to get a ERR 6 error.  Cleared the thread, still no luck.  I took the machine to a Brother certified service center.  They advised they couldn't find anything wrong, except that it didn't work and could not help any further.  They advised to return it to the manufacturer.  When I called Brother, they advised my only alternative was to take it to another Factory Service Center.  I did, same story.  It appears that neither Brother or their Factory Service Centers care if their products stop working once the warranty runs out.  That type of service I can do without.  This one went into the trash, a $180 lesson in what brand NOT to buy.  I don't yet know what my replacement will be but it will absolutely not be a Brother 
 Reading this book was exhausting, confusing, and extremely unsatisfying. Sentences and parqagraphs ramble arround with confusing descriptions and conflicting information. Some major elements that are introduced are left hanging; never brought up again. Others are revisited ad nauseum. Barr's quirky way of describing people and places with bizarre comparisons slows down the plot and is just missleading. Although I did stay with it until the contrived end, this is the first book I ever attacked with a red pen and edited a I went along. I estimate it could have been 50 pages shorter, and have carried far more impact, without the extraneous language. I am shocked she sells well enough to have published so many books. I'd stay far away from her in the future and purify yourself by reading a clasic P.D. James or a pure and simple Sue Grafton 
 This is everything that is wrong with party politics in America.  My party - right or wrong.  Forget what is in the best interest of the nation.  Much of the writing and the ideas expressed are roughly equivalent to a junior high school understanding.  Way too much emotion and ranting, with, as I said before, not enough real analysis of what is good for the country.  These people (party politicians) are what is going to destroy America.  And it is happening, at a far faster rate that even Rome fell 
 Brainwashing is not a good way to educate young people about the world around them.  This is a blatant effort to wrench young children's emotions and therefore their perspectives  about the eeeevil effects of "global warming" by engaging their sympathies.  The only plot is brainwashing, using penguins as the straw man.  The penguin world is factually well documented if one is interested in teaching children about them.  As a responsible parent, I would avoid this entirely. 
 A long long time ago I can still remember how my sister Used to play his songs  And in the 80s changed his style Songs like Love Touch were so vile And Forever Young was on the charts too long  But this whole series makes me shiver With each new horror it delivers Bad and cheesy music It always makes me so sick  I can't remember if I spewed when I Heard him sing "It Had To Be You" But his integrity tore in two  The day the music died 
 I usually read right before im going to bed, and i just couldnt get into this book, the information was the same and it was all very predictable.  Im sure that if i wouldve finished it, then i would have loved it, because i love almost all of danielle steel's books.  If you havent read most of them, then your missing out, so stop reading this boring passage, and get into a book of hers 
 Thought I'd just confirm what I've learned too.  I bought it, realized after research it could be picked in seconds with a pen and returned it 
 "Sudden Death" is the second Andy Carpenter book that I've read(I was introduced to the series last year when I read 'Bury the Lead'). As with the previou book, the charaters are inteesting, well-developed and quirky without being too annoying.  The plot is the biggest problem with 'Sudden Death'. There's a lot of build-up, but very little payoff. This won't stop me from reading other entries in this series, but Rosenfelt needs to tweak things a bit. Some of the similarities to Robert B. Parker and the 'Spenser' cast are rather obvious here. Maybe Rosenfelt needs to work on finding his own 'voice' and motivation for these characters, rather than simply emulating what others have done before 
 "The Glorious Cause" is the sequel to "Rise to Rebellion," and since the first novel was so good I eagerly dove into this one, but was disappointed to find it had nowhere near the same depth and quality of characterization. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a 4, as compared to the 8 I would give "Rise to Rebellion."  The events recounted in "Rise to Rebellion" involving the lead up to the Revolutionary War seemed so much more detailed and interesting, with a vast array of characters that were so colorful; John Adams, Paul Revere, Samuel Adams, Ben Franklin, and others. "The Glorious Cause" was not without its merits, but it seemed so much drier and less appealing, with a more narrow focus. It was far too long in some parts, to the point my attention wandered, and getting through it was a chore in some sections, unlike the preceding novel which seemed to turn its own pages. I listened to this book on audio tape during my commute, and often found myself impatiently trying to keep my focus upon the narrative while controlling my urge to fast forward to a livelier scene.  One element I felt truly slighted by was the coverage of Benedict Arnold and his defection to the British cause. I assumed this would be one of the lengthier and more rewarding sections of the book, but it zipped by fairly rapidly with little genuine immersion into the subject material.  A mark of a good book is how I feel when I have finished reading it - if I am disappointed I have reached the end of the story, then I know it was time well spent. Getting to the end of "The Glorious Cause" felt more like finishing some particularly grueling outdoor project; it was uncomfortable work, and now that I'm done I feel I can do something a bit more interesting. Because Shaara did such a good job with "Rise to Rebellion" I don't feel my lack of appeal for this book is his responsibility; perhaps the subject matter didn't complement my taste as well. I prefer interesting historial detail over tepid, droning battle descriptions, and I feel the differences between those two categories represent perfectly the differences between "Rise to Rebellion" and "The Glorious Cause. 
 You are better off getting the Norton Anthology of Poetry.  This book is marketed as a personal selection, yet contains a fairly standard array of poems taken from other anthologies.  Do we need Bloom to select some chestnut by Robert Frost for us 
 My five and three year old daughters fought over this is the store, but the three year old won and we placed it in her room as a night-light.  The thing is so loud that she asked for her music to be turned up so she could hear it above the lamp.  Needless to say, the lamp is only for decoration now - no one could actually sleep with it on. 
 It can indeed be extremely stressful for a Japanese speaking foreigner working at a Japanese company in Japan. I say this from direct personal experience. But my impression is that the author's only skill was the ability to speak Japanese. She had no basic office skills e.g. she was unable to perform simple calculations. And she had neither business training nor business experience. Amelie Nouthomb's degree was in philology not business or economics or finance. This being the case she was unqualified to perform any complex tasks. Little wonder that her brief experience of working in Japan was such a disaster. 
 After 18 months over dating , I thought I would give this book to my boyfriend in hopes he could come to a decision about marriage or the possibility in the following year.Before this everything was fine!After I put this PRESSURE on him to think about what he wants, etc. He BOLTED and cheated on me- something that is not even natural for him out of total fear!I think the realtionship is over for good now because I could not wait until HE WAS READY to do this on his own- Don't make the same mistakes I did- throw out "the Rules" and these other manipulative this that tell you how to make a man marry you and give ultimatums. Any time you use these tactics you are taking a risk they will backfire on you. I would do anything to take back what I did, but it is to late (probably) and I will have to learn from my mistakes 
 "....an indispensible resource for understanding how our current cultural moment is inflected by changing conceptions of the past" as another reviewer puts it. It sure is that. It certainly demostrates quiet clearly how some academics choose to reappropriate historical fact in order to fall in line with the narrow, convaluted views and theoretical constructs of a few, who wish to establish themselves as the, self appointed, "new and improved" cannon. Far too many ommissions for my liking.Its a huge and relevant Art world out there !!   Be warned..If you are not prepared for the language (at least Batchelor of Arts Degree level)you may feel like an illiterate Medieval peasant travelling out of your village for the first time in order to enter the doors of Cologne cathedral to hear a man in a pointy hat speaking Latin ! 
 With much anticipation we awaited the arrival of Clay's second album, thinking this one would make the career of one of our favorite singers... and instead we fear that it is likely to end his career.  While Clay's voice still sounds great, the CD is an entire collection of uninspired, underproduced remakes ... not one of which goes beyond the original.  As you can see, this CD is nowhere on the billboard charts, and we're very sad to say in our household, that it's for good reason.  Save your money and buy one of the much better Idol CDs ... and almost any of them are, most recently Kelly Pickler and Carrie Underwood. 
 Within the next four years, at least 3 (if not 4) Supreme Court Justices are expected to retire, leaving vacancies that must be filled. What type of judges should fill those spots is a question of much debate. It was with that question in mind that Pat Robertson wrote this book.   Now, first let it be said that although I am not a Christian, I am in strong agreement with a good amount of Robertson's observations. The courts have indeed usurped the power of democratic legislatures by striking down statutes (and legislating policy) on flimsy grounds. And, yes, the federal courts have certainly become more liberal in how they interpret the constitution, preferring not to look at what the document SAYS, as much as what these unelected judges think it should MEAN. Robertson speaks eruditely to both points and for that, he earns 2 stars.  Unfortunately, I cannot give him 3 more. Having a master's degree in Politcal Science from a top southern institution, I have studied quite a bit to do with law and the judiciary. As such, I found much of Robertson's history either caricaturized or simply wrong, many of his positions unviable if not contradictory, and several of his arguments unpersuasive.   Let me highlight the history. To Robertson's credit, he goes a long way in showing that many of the founders were Christian (something that is hard to deny). What Robertson does not do, though, is make a case that since they were privately christians, that God is somehow in our constitution. Pat asserts that He is, but anyone reading the constitution's text sees that He is not. There are many other historical gaffs in the book (like citing anti-federalist Patrick Henry as exemplar of the founder's intent, and deist Thomas Jefferson as an example of a good Christian.)   As far as points being either nebulous or contradictory: Robertson states over and over that he believes the constitution should be interpreted by the founder's original intent. There are several problems: first, the founders are dead and we can't ask them what they meant. Second, the only record of the constitutional convention we have is by James Madison dictated quickly and from memory. Third, is the intent to be that of the founders or the several hundred people who ratified the constitution into law via the states? I go into this because these are large problems that Robertson simply glosses over.   Robertson also tells us that we should interpret the constitution, when possible, by discerning its quite clear text. With this point I agree (and I have as much respect for Scalia's textualism as Robertson does). But with that, Robertson is quick to tell us that somehow, the 'free press' clause  doesn't permit things like protection of pornography and that the 'free speech' clause doesn't protect flag burning. To quote Justice Hugo Black (himself a textualist): "I always thought that "Congress shall make no law," meant "Congress shall make no law.") Apperently, Robertson doesn't think so, even while he professes that where the text is unambiguous, we should rely solely on it.   I hate to ramble on with these points, but I do want to make clear how unsatisfactory this book is. If one does want to read a similar position articulated more intelligently, I would suggest that one reads (a) Robert Bork's "The Tempting of America,' (b) a new collection of Scalia's opinions called "Scalia Dissents," and even a book by legal progressor Robert George called "The Clash of Orthodoxies." All make the case more persuasively than Robertson's book.   
 I guess I'm one of the minority who don't care for this series and set of characters. This was my first 'In Death' book and will be my last. Although nearly all of the characters were unengaging and not likeable, the heroine, Eve Dallas, was right at the top of the list: harsh, nasty, vulgar and very off-putting. And what, oh WHAT is the deal with that amazingly stupid character name Nixie Swisher??! Please 
 I purchased this radio and charged it for two full days and got 10 minutes of listening pleasure. I called their 800 number to find out what was wrong. They indicated that I am supposed to charge it for 3 days (The booklet fails to mention how long to charge it yet has instructions in many different languages for your convenience). I did that, and enjoyed a full 75 minutes of play time.  This was far from their 4 hours estimated play time. I returned it to the reseller and got another figuring it was a fluke. Charged it in great anticipation, and got about 70 minutes of play time for 3 days of charging. I called the 800 number again. Eton offered to replace it, but I had to pay for the shipping. I didn't think that was fair and tried to return it to the local reseller after my 30 days from the original sale was up. Luckilly the reseller took the radio back and refunded my money. Two bad radios just a fluke? Maybe so. But why penalize the the customer and ask him to eat the cost of shipping to fix Eton's problem? Plus the design is such that the bottom of the radio is rounded and the unit cannot stand up on its own. Eton said it is meant to be left in the electrical outlet. During a "blackout", I'd want it to be portable and set it just about anywhere. Go figure.  
 Elizabeth Peters is one of my top 5 favorite authors ever.  However, this book is really bad.  I couldn't even finish it, and I really hate to stop in the middle of a book.  If you haven't read this yet, don't; read _The Crocodile on the Sandbank_ instead.  If you've already read this, please don't judge Ms Peters by this work.  I urge you to give her another shot, because _The Camelot Caper_ is well below the quality of her other books. 
 I found nothing of value in this book. If you are looking for a newer sales model, you would be better off looking at Unlock the Game by Ari Galper. 
 I loved most of the other books by Mr. Vinge. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for Rainbows End. The author clearly invested a lot of time in trying to figure out how the world may look like in a few tenths of years. In this, I believe he did well. The problem is, that all this insight and description (e.g., what is going to be taught in schools, the interconnectedness of the world, the superimposition of virtual to real views, etc) does not combine with a good and catching story. The first 4 pages of the book do primise something great - what unfortunately is not delivered in the rest of the book 
 After reading about half of this book, I had to stop.  I am not very inspired.  In fact, it had the opposite effect on me.  A lot of the stories I read were too much about the hardships and not enough about the positive outcomes that people had.  Kind of scared me a bit..is this what I have to look forward to as the years progress?  I was more inspired by Montel's book (once I got past the ego part of it) 
 I will agree with that other review that states this headset is uncomfortable.  The ear cushions are fine, but the frame presses into my head quite hard.  I added some padding which helped, but it is still a poor design.  I can't complain about the function though.  Mic is clear and sound quality is good for my purposes.  
 Ok, this was a kind of nice little book. But not really. The information inside of this book was VERY basic. It never went into details about betta housing (just kept on referring to betta bowls, tiny little bowls in which a betta WOULD NOT be happy in). So thats what took away some starts, was the lack of useful information.  This book had a lot of pictures. Pictures are all well and good, but not in this book. Most of the pictures were of older, boring 'veil tail' finned bettas. Those are bettas of the past. Now we have half moons, and crowntails, so much better. But there was one image of a half moon, and one or two of delta tailed bettas. So the betta community was not represented in the least by this book. Just old veil tails.   Overall, not a good book. 
 Flynn offers up a fast-paced, if unbelievable story.  Unfortunately, character development is paper thin and clearly portrays Flynn's political preferences.  Characters, like Rapp, with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles, have all the answers and are always showing those good-for-nothing politicians how the "real world" works.  Meanwhile, Flynn's politicians (the majority of whom are Democrats) seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election.  While there are grains of truth in his characters, Flynn consistently goes for the cheap, partisan stereotype.  I was looking for a well-developed political/military thriller.  I'm still looking. 
 I think it is hard for me to reconcile the fact that this is the sequel to Pink Slip, which was truly funny and smart. This follows the mariage of Eben and Lisa, but isn't as warm or touching. It is pretty realistic abou thte difficulties of marraige but deosn't show the joys very well. Lisa strikes me as very off-putting in this.  i agree with another reviewer who was just as puzzeld as I about the disappearance of family and friends-I loved those characters (especially Lisa's Mom) in book 1.  Without these characters, the book is very neurotic and Lisa frankly seems self-obsessed.  Even with my gripes, I still say Ciresi is a very good author. I kept right on reading the book to see how it would end.    
 I bought this book expecting to receive a comprehensive 31-day plan complete with recipes.  As I began to write out the recipes, it became apparent that nine of the lunch recipes were missing in the first week  alone!  Since the author does not respond to email at his website, I am  stuck with a lot of expensive health food ingredients for breakfast and  dinner, and no way of knowing what to do about lunch!  It can also be very  difficult to locate a lot of the ingredients, even if you can figure out  what they are.  I don't recommend this book for anyone serious about the  specific diet plan because you will be disappointed.  There are other  points he makes about exercise and self-empowerment that are probably  covered in many of his other books 
 Okay, so In Touch has never claimed to be anything other than what it is: A glossy tabloid.  But just when you didn't think it was possible for the American tabloid press to dumb down any further, along came In Touch Weekly and US Weekly.    All In Touch really is is a bunch of photographs.  Their writing is slop, fit for second graders, and it doesn't go into much detail (and we all know how amazingly "accurate" these tabloids are, anyway).  Want a quality tabloid?  Read Hello! magazine (from England). - Donna Di Giacom 
 I have put this film off for years for no particular reason,just didn't get around to watching it until recently. I had heard plenty of good things about it & had definitely planned on buying it at some point because of all the positive reviews I'd read. I am so glad I got to catch it the other night on the IFC channel because it is truly one of the most overrated horror films ever made! Not the worst ever made but nowhere near as good as people have made it out to be. There are some good effective scenes,I do particularly think Dee Snyder did a pretty decent job as a twisted lost soul addicted to pain,torture & his love affair with death,ranting & raving about society while he plays with his victims but there still wasn't enough of that good creepy stuff to cover up how illogical the whole story was. It seemed very rushed & unfinished wich intern provides a ridiculous amount of plot holes. Most of the acting was alright but the lead Detective & his annoying partner were aweful(no grip what so ever on ther character's). In the end "STRANGELAND" felt like it was a bad rushed sequel to a better movie. This film is made out to be so much better than it is,a perfect example of how low the standards were for what passed as a good horror film in the 1990's compared to now! 
 Sobibor and Samar are decent movies. Pacific Inferno is not worth the money, even if it is included with the other two 
 This is an interesting book and I liked Hirsch's personal accounts and writing style, but I disagree that anyone with diabetes or with a family member with diabetes should read it. This is the most depressing and sobering book I have ever read. If you want history, read Michael Bliss's "The Discovery of Insulin." If you want medical information and advice, contact the American Diabetes Association. If you want to worry yourself sick, read this book. Maybe this will help some persons with diabetes become "scared straight" with their management, but I think it would make most feel hopeless and scared. I would only recommend this to someone who is thinking about making a charitable donation to a diabetes fundraiser 
 I thought these History Pockets would compliment our homeschool well.  I was wrong.  They are good for bursts of information, but we found them to be busy work, dull and redundant to our learning.   I would not recommended them to fellow homeschoolers.  
 I received the CD in a reasonable amount of time but unfortunately the CD was not in A1 shape.  There is a scratch on the CD and one of the songs on the CD skips A LOT which is disappointing.  
 This books is ok. I don't really know what Danzy was talking about, though. What was with that list of black people (who weren't even black!)? I'm guessing it's a joke that went over my head. I stopped reading after David Mura's part. He said Dean Cain was 1/2 Japanese. Dean Cain is 1/4. I think people should check their facts before writing something that will be published. I can't go on with this book. Eventually I will because he wasn't the only writer in the book. His just bothered me. Even if it's a little thing, giving wrong information isn't a good thing 
 The author had suspicions that her therapist thought she was a whiner, and I'll bet she's right!  If I needed to say one good thing about this book, it has convinced me not encourage my kids to attend my alma matter where the author teaches.  I have to admit that I didn't get through the whole entire book as it was just unreadable to me.  She blames these  amorphous "societal pressures" for many of her thoughts and actions.  How about personal responsibility?  When she has some tender feelings for her unborn child, she even blames the pro-life movement for getting inside her head.  She feels "pressure" to mention safety of her baby, in addition to her own preferences, when discussing birth options.  It's not society speaking to you -- it's your conscience!  Why do people keep congratulating her for her "honesty?"  What is so fabulous about writing down all sorts of selfish rants.  I'll bet her kids won't think her "honesty" is so wonderful when their classmates get wind of what was written in here about how much she enjoyed her pregnancies and how she compared them to a ----.  As for the reviews on the back cover, I have news for one of you ladies.  I knew your kids, and they were not happy people, failing classes, doing drugs.  But I guess you didn't care since, like the author, you were probably too busy trying to figure out how to make yourself happy.   New moms out there, you need to find a way to get over yourselves and give some of yourselves to your children.  You don't want your kids to end up in misery.  It is hard; I have young ones myself.  Finding joy in the hard work is how to become happy.  Don't think your kids are just going to "turn out okay" if you follow the author's path, because I've yet to see a kid of a mom who is self-absorbed to this extent "turn out okay."  And "frequent parenting miles?"  Please.  Stop trying to make sure things are 50-50 and start thinking of the division of labor as each of you giving 100%.  
 I read this book, because it was in my "funny chick lit" list. There are reviews in Amazon and on the cover by other "funny chick lit" writers, Marian Keyes and Jane Green, who's books are funny & romantic. This wasn't.  The main character is a shallow, cold, controlling, unpleasant (rich, but that's cool) figure. She schemes to divorce a nice guy she's been married to for 11 years to get engaged to a creep she dated in college. She matures at the end. Goodness! Who would read this book? It's not a self-help for shallow, cold, controlling, unpleasant women who wouldn't waste their time on this type of book anyway, and wouldn't see themselves in it even if they did read the book. It doesn't add anything delightful, entertaining or even enlightening. Not worth its "chick lit" tag 
 I want to like Tim Kinsella, I really do. But I just think that his voice is crap. It works on some Joan of Arc stuff, but I just can't get into it. Mike, where are you? And is there any way that you can revive American Football? This is tired experimentation for experimentation's sake. No cohesion. Pity, becuase I had higher hopes 
 This book may well have been filled with great writing, however, as a dog owner and lover, I was disgusted and depressed reading these stories.  The reviews on the book cover give little indication as to the repeated  ugliness within.  If you are a parent, imagine reading story after detached  story of babies being killed, lost and neglected.  For me, any great  writing was overshadowed by my sympathies for the dogs.  Not what I  expected and very sad 
 What do you get when you combine some of the worst musicians in the world? You get G-Unit! So we have 50 Cent and some other no name idiots that I don't give a sh** about. The lyrics are horrible! You have one guy rambling like an idiot about how he has lots of money and that he has more prostitutes than anyone. You have a retarded DJ who plays beats that are headache inducing. And you have that random female singer who sings about how she's a slut and telling little girls to act all girly and all of that bullsh**. It's sad because at my school this stuff is king. There's a bunch of idiots wearing their G-Unit t-shirts while I come to school wearing a kick-ass Iron Maiden shirt. A couple of girlies say that heavy metal is scary and say that G-Unit owns this world. The title of this review says it all..G-Unit are the decline of humanity...:' 
 1st. off being a very big Martial Arts fan this movie doesn't even come in the same category as a Martial Arts Movie, the reason it hasn't been released so far is because the Movie Sucked Big Time. Conan Lee was in this movie which is the reason I went to see it when it 1st. came out and he gets killed within 10minutes of the movie. So don't even waste your time or money to buy this. I had to give this 1 star because it doesn't have a 0-Star rating 
 This album just like all of Jessica's albums is not country. This is Nashville at it again, trying to sell pop as country. Whan will you learn Nashville that country fans like myself are sick of pop music passing itself off as country. If you like the typical nashville pop singers like, LeeAnn Rime, Shania Twain or Faith Hill. Then you are sure to love this junk. But if you are a country fan I would advise you not to buy this. But one thing I am glad about, is that her career didn't last longer than two years. Jessica you are now a has been. ~~ Twan 
 I bought two Bionicles for my son's stocking at Christmas.  He is 5 so I had to help him put them together.  It took forever to construct this sad little robot and within minutes of playing with it, it began to fall apart.  The instructions are not clear and the overall durability just stinks.  If your child just wants to construct them and display them, then this is great.  If your child wants to play with them, forget it.  Go buy a preassembled action figure and move on with your life 
 Esolen is neither a Dante scholar nor an Italian language/literature specialist.  He is an English Teacher at Providence College, a Catholic institution.   His retelling of the Divine Comedy, which appears to be based on earlier translations, is reasonably accurate and readable.  The problem comes with his notes.  They range from the scandalously inadequate to the downright offensive.  Esolen has written a number of anti-gay articles for religious publications.  This is reflected in his notes where he refers to homosexuality as "that most heinous of sins".   And there are other similarly personal and inappropriate remarks. This is not only offensive in a contemporary publication, but is totally of tune with Dante, who took a much more sympathetic and nuanced approach c.1300 AD.  There are many superior translations out there.  Mandelbaum's is excellent and has good notes.  Robert and Jean Hollander's is also very fine and the notes are the most extensive and informative of all.  What the Modern Library had in mind when commissioning this translation, which is neither scholarly nor distinguished as poetry, remains a mystery. 
 Andrew Appel's textbook (Modern Compiler implementation in Java) has been prescribed as a Course Textbook. Given a choice, I strongly recommend to take it from the library or any place where you can get it for free for one semester/quarter. This book is not worth the money and is an absolute waste. Not only does it not teach you anything about compilers, but if you already know something, then it serves to confuse you.  The author has tried to explain things using an example and "steps" through the process of writing a compiler. So in that sense, if you are just looking to write a compiler and be done with it whether you understand it or not, then this book might be considered OK, though not good in any sense.   No theory about compilers is explained and the author seems to be talking to himself throughout the text 
 Richard Rodriguez whines and complains in his book.  I have similar experiences. I was born in Mexico.  I was reared in America and went to Catholic schools.  I have a darker than average complexion.  People often ask me what country I was born in just by looking at me, but that did not warp my wife like it seemed to for Rodriguez. I have a friend who went to Stanford, like Rodriguez, on scholarship, but he did not whine about it.  I googled Rodriguez and found a published speech where he continues to show weak character. Here is a quote from one of his speeches: "... if you really want to scare the United States of America, all you would have to say to the United States of America is "I'm going to marry you. I'm going to start dating your son." "  This is pretty sad and tasteless.  Besides showing weak character, Rodriguez is a poor writer.  I have never seen so many sentence fragments.  At one point in his book he admits he never liked writing when he was in school.  It shows.  This book is an insult to the Latin-American community from a condescending publisher.  We deserve better.  Going beyond his weakness as a writer and as a person, I would say Rodriguez realized his life was inauthentic (re: Heidegger).  He was thrown into his life and rebelled at the life he was given (a degree from Stanford, many job offers in spite of incomplete and inferior creditials).  He rejected the life for which he was prepared, but he sunk into an unending cycle of complaining instead of creating an authentic life for himself.  He needed to find some way of creating a meaningful life for himself.  There are many ways to create for yourself a meaningful life.  "Achieve  Lasting Happiness" by Robert Canright is good book based on the principals of self-cultivation.  If Rodriguez had success in creating for himself an authentic life, this book might have had some merit.  As it is, it is just sad 
 From the opening of the book on we learn that Philip Roth is the one with the ultimate wisdom. Using the Monica Lewinsky scandal - a recurring theme in the book - he shows us that we are all prude. The sexual revolution, which was brought to the literature by Philip Roth (among others), has failed. There is still much to do. For the remaining of the book Roth will try very hard to shock us, by using as much dirty language as possible. I have never heard anyone talking like that and I highly doubt that Philip Roth has. At times I thought, "Philip, you can relax, we know now that you know all these words!"  He will also write down his very own philosophy, and how he writes, how he manages to write pages and pages without developing any new idea, introduces the taste that here is someone who has understood it all. In this book, there are so many passages where you can just jump ahead without missing anything.   It is not a sign of good literature if you notice that not Zukerman, the narrator of the story, is the one speaking to us, but Philip Roth himself. And his tone has something of a know-it-all, and something bitter. After having read it, I thought that Roth is no-one I want to meet or I want to discuss with. Then I read some articles about him, and indeed, he has not the reputation of being an easy character. You feel that on every page of the book.  But the book has larger flaws. First, I do not like the narrative. It is Zukerman who speaks, and he is a first person narrator. At the same time he is omniscient and can replicate interior monologues of all the protagonists. I do not like this mix up, and I feel that Roth just does not manage this choice of perspective. Compare it with Great Gatsby or Brothers Karamazov where the author can control this kind of storytelling (a first person narrator) much better.  Then there are the inner monologues which are far from flawless or interesting. They are really quite pointless and, frankly, badly written. They go on pages and pages without making a point, without adding something to the story. If you have read Ulysses or Miss Dalloway, you see such a quality difference.   The book could have been so much better if well written. The topic - the individual and how it is shaped by society - is highly interesting. The main character, by looking for individuality, looses it totally, but only because the society does not want to accept him as he is. And at times, you can get an idea how brilliant Roth could be, would he take a little more time for his books, write less, but more carefully and would he be less egomaniacal. For example, we find out in detail how Silk characterizes Delphine Roux. Later, she characterizes Silk. How these individual characterizations diverge from their true characters is very interesting. Again, the topic how an individual is shaped by the behavior of others.  Well, there are far too few good scenes like that in the book to make up for the flaws. Given how many good books there are, I wouldn't waste my time on that one. 
 I love the Scarpetta books, but I had to force myself to finish this one.  The plot was disjointed, and the use of the English language was atrocious.  I can't believe she published this.  It is absolutely not up to par.  If you're going to waste your time on this book, get it from a library so you don't waste your money as well 
 I was greatly disappointed with this book. Not only was the ending of the novel predictable, but the characters were down right dull. I really wished that the dream sequences had included a few from the actual movies. Now I realize the backlash this can cause, and I know the books aren't written just for the fans of the movies, but without giving too much of the plot away, it would've been nice to see some dreams from the movie characters. There have been only two books from Black Flame in this series I have enjoyed "Suffer the Children" and "Perchance to Dream" (which I only enjoyed partly because charcters were offed that shouldn't have been), and it was because the authors understood the charcter and story material and wrote really good novels. I can't understand how these mediocre novels keep reaching the shelves. Hopefully if there is another book it will be better 
 I really wanted to like this movie, as biblical subjects always interest me. But this film is a dreary and uninspir/ed/ing treatment of the Christmas story, all but ruined for me by the lead actress's wooden, callow performance. Surprising, since Castle-Hughes was so fine in the Whalerider film. She has much the same facial expression throughout the movie, no matter the emotional context of each scene. The actor playing Joseph, Oscar Isaac, gave much more depth to his character--a charming and tender performance.  The story itself is rendered in a flatly traditional fashion, without any of the warm beauty one might hope for given the Christmas theme. (I'm reminded of the gorgeous birth-of-Christ preface to 1959's Ben Hur--just a few minutes, but oh so emotionally evocative!)   All in all, not much to remember or hold dear in this movie. Too bad 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 the book the color purple is a very good book.The book is kind of hard to understand because of the way that they talk. The book is about a girl  name celie and she and she was the oldest out of her sisters so she was picked 2 marry a guy and that guy used 2 beat her and rap her. this book make me think about what do i what to be when i grow up and that im going to make more of my self as a black young lady 
 This book has gotten a lot of ratings that I don't think It deserves.  For one thing it doen't have ANY suspense whatsoever until close to the end. Honestly, I was ready to put the book down less than halfway through the book and I LOVE to read. Just a warning: If you're expecting a great mystery read, don't read this book. Sure the ending's pretty awesome, and Bindy is strangely a likeable character, but this book is not worth your money. In fact this book discourages me from reading ANY of Jacklyn Moriarty's other books. It's not because I don't like this type of book, I'll read anything, It's because this book is BOR-ING. In my opinion this book is OVERRATED 
 A major, and I mean MAJOR, problem with this book is that there is NO INDEX! Who ever heard of a non-fiction book like this without an index?  If you want to find anything, it's impossible.  And the chapter heads aren't any help either.  Nack includes a lot of material that I was not interested in.  When I bought and read this book, I thought Secretariat was the be-all and end-all of horseracing, and I didn't care to learn all about his background and all about every person who had ever come in contact with him.  There are very few photos, at least in my paperback edition, and these are in black and white, denying me a view of Secretariat's beautiful chestnut coat.  Secretariat, when he was three, had 12 starts, but won only 9, came in second twice, and third, once. He lost 3 races--STAKES races, to average horses. Not exactly a great record.  Lots of horses have had better sophomore years.  Once he was overtaken in the stretch by another horse, and another time he couldn't catch the leader in the stretch.  He was known to run poorly on off=tracks.  He was fortunate that all of the Triple Crown races were run on fast tracks.  If one had been sloppy--who knows?  Secretariat's immortality is based on three things: 1) His incredible Belmont, a fantastic feat that no one can take away from him. However, his only real competition, Sham, dropped out early, so he was in essence simply running against the clock. 2) The fact that he was the first horse in 25 years to win the Triple Crown.  He broke the jinx that had prevented several excellent horses before him from turning horseracing's hat trick. 3) He was a gorgeous-looking horse.  How important that is in the TV age! If you watch TV, how often do you see ugly or plain people?   Citation, the previous winner of the Triple Crown in 1948, had 20 starts, with 19 wins and one second (in a stakes TRIAL, with a new rider, Eddie Arcaro, who took full blame for the loss). In the Derby, on a muddy track, he ran down Coaltown, one of the 100 best horses of the century, to win by 3. In the Preakness, again on a muddy track, he won by 5.  In the Belmont, on a fast track, he was in first place wire to wire, winning easily by 8 lengths. Then, he won the Sysonby Mile against the best older sprinters in the land. THREE DAYS LATER, he raced in the Jockey Club Gold Cup when it was two miles, beat the best stayers in the country, including Phalanx, the 1947 Belmont winner, by 7 lengths. Then, 2 weeks later, he ran in the 1-5/8 mile Empire City cup in Yonkers and won again, beating older horses. He finished his year by winning two races in California!  Secretariat never did anything in his career to even come close to what Citation did. Yet people deify Secretariat and totally ignore Citation. I hope to rectify this soon by honoring Citation with his own website.  Look for it 
 We all like hearing scary stories about monsters.  This book provides a few of them.  Because of its pulp horror novel quality it has some redeaming value.  The negatives make it not only a bad read, but make me wish that I had not read it. 1) The author spends a lot of time tooting his own horn. This is fine, but you grow weary of it after a few chapters.  It wouldn't be so annoying but because of the way he writes comes off as if he is trying too hard to make it sound like NOT bragging.  Because of this I grew very aware of it, like when your tounge won't stop worrying at a new tooth-filling. 2) It grows very predictable.  We get it!  Serial killers are psychos who fit into patterns and act out fantasies. It isn't a surprise anymore once we learned this early in the book. 3) Ressler brags about his profile helping to send 4-5 Chicago teenagers to prison for a a grusome murder/rape.  A decade after this book went to press DNA evidence and discovery of the real killers proved that these kids had been railroaded--unequivocally innocent.  Ooops!  This incredibly gross injustice wouldn't seem so terrible if Ressler didn't come off as such a judgemental, I-told-you-so-ing, J. Edgar Hoover loving cop's cop 
 I have long had the desire to read a Grisham book, because I have heard good things.  Well, my chance came and I was sorely disappointed.  The audio cd's were on sale at a truck stop and I decided to get them for The Chamber.  The opening to the book kept me going, but by chapter three, I had already decided this, "If Sam Cayhall lives I'm going to be mad because I get furious about hate crimes, and if he dies, he had better not die a martyr or worse yet the "hero" to the story."  Sadly, I pursued curious about the ending.  I'm very glad I got the cds instead of the book, because it only took six hours to get through it.  Sure wish I had those six hours back and the money invested so I could try a diferent author.  Mayber Grisham's other books are better, but I won't be reading them 
 I usually like the Bible series - but this one is not only confusingly laid out, the treatment of the subject is at best novice. It seemed the authors wrote out of the Manual instead of actually working out the details for themselves by using the software. If can be avoided, then don't buy it 
 I have not received my order yet although you said I could expect the delivery in early September 
 Coetzee is without a doubt a good writer and he has written many fine novels, unfortunatly In the Heart of the Country is not one of them. Not a author known for fast pacing who has made up for that with eloquence and  interesting caracters without being boring. In this book he fails on all  accounts. To enjoy this book you would have to be a absalut diehard fan  Coetzee 
 as much as I have been a lifelong fan of black moon and buckshot in general this album just lacked the ironically titled "chemistry"between buckshot and 9th Wonder.  The beats were a bit lackluster and boring and rides that razor thin line of boring and laid back with most of the beats raiding the boredom zone.  they are working on a part two so I hope they take their times to create something permament rather than something disposable as this album was.  
 Mr. West writes about the Vatican not about the Roman Catholic Church. If he had not been a priest i would  have understand some of his descriptions  about Catholic Church. Since he has enouph information on the subject it  seems he wants to "reprove" some of the Church's institutions by  providing information he knows not beeing totaly correct. Saying half a  true it is the better way to say a lie Maria Santo 
 I have used Turbo Tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it. This year however some "genius" decided to change the entire format and approach and I found this year's version to be terrible. Very confusing now when used to be clear and simple. Hard to even download, confusing up dates, difficult to find numerous frequently used items (estimated taxes paid in previous year, capital gains/losses, state taxes paid, and more). The running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed.     I have zero confidence in this year's program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years. Have recommended Turbo Tax to many over the years, but would strongly recommend against buying this year's product. A perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it. Suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software, this one stinks 
 There was only one character worth liking in the book and she basically got screwed over.  There were just too many characters with no redeeming qualities.  I finished the book but it left a very bad taste in my mouth 
 I wanted to start this off with a "do NOT buy this game". It is extremely boring and it looks like someone just designed it on their computer and just made a thousand copies of it to sell. Very bad production. This was a complete waste of my $12.99. I wouldn't even have purchased it if it was $1. That's how bad it is. There are different categories like wedding, Christmas, etc. And each category had about 8 different games in it. There's hardly any music and the multiple choice questions flash by on the screen. The questions are uninteresting. If you want an exciting game, try the Shout About Movies DVD games. I really like all the Shout About DVD game series. 
 The product description for Killers' 'Hot Fuss' describes it as 'eleven nuggets of reel-you-in storytelling genius'. Come on. With the exception of 'Somebody Told Me', the lead singer runs the gamut of emotions from A to B (to paraphrase Dorothy Parker). 'Mr. Brightside' features all of 3 or 4 notes total and banal lyrics that are repeated, in full twice. No melody. Killers wouldn't know a good tune if it bit them in their collective arses. 
 The book starts out well enough when banker Ben Hartman, in Switzerland on business, runs into an old college buddy who tries to kill him.  Then through a series of accidental discoveries, narrow escapes, and unbelievable coincidences, Hartman learns that practically everybody he knows, and everyone new he meets, is involved in an evil cabal bent on world domination. When you finally find out who the criminal mastermind is, it seems like something only Austin Powers' nemesis Dr. Evil could have pulled off.  Without giving too much away - I have to say that the ending involves the hero attempting a daring rescue from the villain's heavily-guarded, secret mountain lair.  And of course there is a scene where the villain feels the need to carry on a long monologue to explain his evil plot to the hero.  Yeah baby, yeah 
 I bought this CD not long after it came out.  It didn't last long in my collection because it only has a few good songs on it!!!  I like Somehow Our Love Survives and Abandoned Garden.  Other than that this is a mediocre effort for Michael. He has used this kind of Brazilian theme on Sleeping Gypsy already. Stick with your roots Michael...you are from California...not South America. Try buying Blue Pacific instead!!! I abandoned this one a long time ago 
 This book provides nice reviews of life cycles of various pests and beneficial speicies, but very little practical, useful information for controlling most of the pests.  Very superficial work.  
 Jack "Deuce" Cooper (Matt LeBlanc) is a minor league baseball pitcher who's got the goods, but no self-confidence. Instead of looking up Dr. Phil, the team manager decides that a simian teammate is just what strike-out Deuce needs for a boost. Enter Ed, a chimp who's got more talent in his elongated little finger than the whole team put together. Ed's antics, including scarfing down chocolate-covered bananas and pulling toupees off of bald heads, were all "aped" by men in monkey suits and animatronics. Unfunny slapstick makes this DVD a real strike-out.  Staci Layne Wilson Author of Staci's Guide to Animal Movie 
 I imagine this is what happens when you become a successfully published author... you are able to go back to your fist efforts of writing and sell them not for the story, but for the author's name.  I had hopes that the book would turn around with an shocking twist, yet the plot played out like a straight to video 80's action flick. If you need to get your fix of man vs. man vs. nature, save a couple hours of your life and watch deliverance 
 I was disappointed when I received this CD.  Although it is original, the music is hard for me to listen for more than a minute or two. By your side, (my favorite) is good for about two minutes.  Then the beat gets off track, and starts to sound terrible.  If this was done on purpose, I cannot fathom why. I know this is "lo-fi", but a hint of bass wouldn't hurt at all.  As it stands, the CD sounds like an unfinished product, and is not nearly good enough to stand on its own. I think this CD would best be used for some sampling...especially in today's hip-hop.  If you are looking for beautiful, relaxing music...look elsewhere 
 Many of the chapters in this book are written by individual carpenters who "do things their own way". For instance, in the first chapter, the writer says to disregard previous techniques and use his method. In the 2nd and 3rd chapters, the writer talks about using power tools that are either outrageously expensive or not even avilable any more. Further, there is no discussion or summary of basic roof geometry and calculations. The tag phrase "for pros by pros" is quite misleading. It is merely 15 chapters of guys telling how THEY frame a roof. Anyone, even pro carpenters using this as a refresher, should start off with a tutorial on basic roof geometry, design, and construction methods. If you are looking for info on how to properly design and construct roof framing, don't waste your money on this one 
 I read about one hundred pages and then, when the consistency of the plot did not improve beyond that of an extra runny rice pudding, I quit. This was my first King book and I am not rushing out to buy another one, especially since it appears to me that this author is unable to pen down anything less than a 1000 pages.  Is it any wonder that it is selling on Amazon for a penny? Actually, I would not even pay that for a product that is as exciting as a bag of wet hair 
 I have read all twelve of these books and hoping there will be more. The language is pretty graphic but they are so funny you can usually ignore those words. These books can cause you embaesment, since I read where ever I have to sit and wait and you burst out laughing people do stare and wonder if you are losing it. Please we would all like to see more of these 
 You can get all the same advice in this book from women's magazines. No new insights 
 The title of this book should have been Suicide: The Fast Track to The Loser Lounge in No-Limit Hold'em Poker Tournaments. This book teaches you how to quickly leave a poker tournament. I've played against players who have used this system before this book was ever written. I agree they might get lucky and go on a rush...but eventually a good player is going to take them out, and they'll never win a tournament with this system....Guaranteed.  
 As ex-infantry I found this a big disappointment and almost unwatchable. This low budget movie spoils the book. A supposed highlight is the SAS field craft, but that's a bad joke. The SAS troop crowds around for camera shots, all the while talking loudly if not shouting. Bog normal infantry don't do this never mind the best of the best, the SAS. The fire-fight sequences are passable. The interrogation is the strongest part of the movie but can't make up for the rest of it. The foul language Even if it's what they used in the field, should have been ameliorated for the movie and it detracts a lot, making it unsuitable for many audiences 
 This book was a big disappointment, starting with its awkward subtitle. At first reading it looks like "the one-thousand-nine-hundred-and fifty-five days of the Dodgers," as if the team had only lasted that long! "The Days of the 1955 Dodgers" would have been better.  But the big problem with this book isn't the title-- it's Maury Allen's slapdash and dull writing. Hard to believe this guy was a successful sportswriter for so many years. His prose is careless, rambling, repetitious, and lack-luster. There are even some spelling errors-- the kind of thing we've come to expect from 20- and 30-something sportswriters, but that you don't expect to find in a writer of Allen's generation.  What saves the book and makes it worth reading-- and the reason I gave it three stars rather than two-- are the many extensive quotations of surviving Dodger players from the 1955 team, and others associated with the team that season. Thanks to Allen's long-established credentials as a sportswriter, he was able to get "face time" with many former players and team officials who are difficult or impossible for others to interview. Ever try to set up an interview with Yogi Berra or Willie Mays?  As they say in Brooklyn, "Fuggeddaboudit!"  This is a pleasant enough read for Brooklyn Dodger lovers, but that wonderful team and that magical year deserve better than they get in this so-so volume 
 You need to be brain dead to believe this crap! Utter and complete nonesense! Gross ignorance required to purchase let alone believe. Don't waste your time or money!  Dr. J 
 I teach a computing ethics course at an area University.  I did not select this book as my text when I reviewed texts for use in the Fall 2004 semester.  I did choose Spinello and Tavani's new reader; but this book--like most of the predecessors Spinello has written--would drive my students nuts -- and they wouldn't know why. Bottom line: poorly written and not easy to read -- lots of tough sentence choices made.  However, as with Spinello's other books, there are some points he makes that no other computing ethics texts' authors do make!  So, I'll glean those points out of his text and present them to my students rather than force them to work their way through and around his prose 
 I have now received 2 copies of this DVD and if you notice there are 3 episodes or more that do not play correctly. My personal favorite is the episode were Jerry is trying to become homecoming queen. It skips a whole chapter... THE WEESLE & THE CHICKEN... maybe the best comedy I have ever seen. Please check your copy and see if this happens, it is not the fault of Amazon it is a bad transfer to DVD that needs to be fixed. If you need to see this chapter it will go black screen for a short time after the locker scene, and skip to the next chapter. To see the chapter, go backard 1 chapter. I have had the same problem on all DVD players   
 This has to be the world's most overused textbook. I have used it in no less than four semester-length courses, two undergraduate and two graduate. So obviously I am sick to death of this book, but I hated it the first time anyway. The book's title is completely misleading; its treatment of all subjects is extremely simplistic. This text might be appropriate for second-year undergraduates, but that's all. The mathematical content is pathetic. For instance, the concept of intertemporal optimization plays a key role throughout the text, but there is virtually no treatment of the calculus of variations, and no treatment of stochastic dynamic programming whatsoever. Thus, the core of this theory is gutted, and we only get a dumbed down version that is palatable enough for Romer's text to sell well with math-averse undergrads. I thought the Stokey-Lucas text was great for its use of recursive methods as a unifying concept. Well, the only unifying concept in Romer's book is the formula for a geometric sum; this will get you through about half of the problems. The scope of Romer's text is not just new classical macro, though; he also surveys Keynesian macro and other topics. (Actually the best thing about this book is that Romer is a relatively unbiased author, plus he surveys a lot of empirical evidence.) Once again his treatment of Keynes is ultra-simplistic - he takes the usual "sticky-prices" interpretation which misses the subtleties in the GTEIM. This time it is not the absence of mathematical rigor that lets Romer down, but simply his failure to address the important issues. Any reading of the GTEIM and related literature will verify this. My view is that any graduate course on macro should use one of the serious texts on new classical macro in conjunction with readings from original books/papers on other macro paradigms, and not use Romer 
 Brannagh's film version of Hamlet blows away every other version, as well as every other Shakespeare based film. It's an easy 5 stars.  Now the DVD is a different matter.  Been hearing about and waiting for this for ages! Every lame-oh shlock film holywood cranks out shows up on DVD and usually big projects like this are milked for every $ they can get with fancy packaging and special editions.    I was part of the project through which a small determined group of fans was able to bring the one season wonder "My So-Called Life" to DVD and there must be close to as large an audience for this.  WHERE IS IT 
 I picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it, and absolutely loved it! It is so smart, funny, and heartbreaking, without ever being sappy. So, naturally, I was curious about the movie too. I figured that because Ephron had written the screenplay too, not much could go wrong. And while the story line followed the book more or less, the movie turned out terrible. I could not have been more disappointed!! First of all, Jack Nicholson is completely miscast, because he essentially plays himself (as usual), not the *interesting* guy that Mark is supposed to be. He is the opposite of charming, funny, tender, lovable, i.e. somebody that the character of the wife (Rachel) would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely. You suspect all along that he is a cad; therefore, Rachel's utter shock at his betrayal doesn't make sense. Besides, he is too old for the role! Meryl Streep is annoyingly twitchy, but much better in her role as Rachel. Still, she can't carry the movie alone, and her love scenes with Nicholson are flat; there is no spark there. I wonder how happy Ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel, and whether she really did write all the scenes. The wedding scene, where Rachel has doubts about marying Mark and spends what feels like 5 hours in a room alone agonizing, while the wedding guests wait, is out of place, not to mention boring, not to mention heavy handed. A total dud 
 I'm not surprised by clunky, poorly designed proprietary interfaces, but spyware is simply unacceptable.  Time to scan the web for ways to disable the malicious aspects of this software.  
   Re-learned lesson: Don't base buying just on reviews. I don't question the orientation-enthusiasm of the film-buff reviewers ladling on high praise; but  for simple movie-lovers these film-school trick reels seem very old, very sophomoric, very naive, clumsy, graphically-melodramatic and only worth buying if one collects for historical/academic reasons. There is nothing new for today's viewer and certainly very little entertainment value offered.  
 I was thoroughly disappointed with this book. I have read a couple other books on general dog training, and this one offered absolutely nothing new above what I had seen before. The case studies presented about dogs  retrained at the author's institute struck me as nothing more than a  blatant advertisement. If you have no experience with dog training  whatsoever, then maybe you will find this book useful. But if you already  have some knowledge of basic training and are looking for some advanced  insight and more effective ways to deal with canine aggression, save your  money. The information here is too superficial 
 In short: even as a beginner, you'll barely get as much out of this as you'd get from watching the free tutorials that come with Modo. Page layout isn't very good for connecting concepts with with illustrations. Description of processes is too lengthy and not to the point. I don't want to hear useless banter, I want to know what the tools do and how to use them. Fast. The book doesn't cover even 1% of the tools/functionality of Modo. This book didn't prepare me for making things on my own, just for making the objects described in the book.  The build quality of the book is the worst I've ever experienced. Pages literally fall out of the book as you turn the pages. 
 This movie was so bad (How Bad Was It?) that I turned it off after about 25 minutes. This is only the second time in my life I stopped watching a movie because it was so poorly done. DO NOT RENT OR BUY THIS MOVIE 
 I am on the last leg of this book, much to my relief.  It is terribly over-written, redundant and irritating to read. Jentz could learn a few lessons from Capote about creating a compelling narrative with an economy of words.  Ever meet one of those people who insist on telling you in great excrutiating detail about how they were wronged?  How every nuance, ambiguity and off-hand comment was a significant episode in their victimization? Even if they are factual, you reach a point where you just don't care anymore.  Jentz went through an unbelievable horrible experience.  Her recounting of the experience, is barely readable.  Go buy In Cold Blood and read it again 
 this remake of the better than ever original is loud,crude,gory,and worst of all DULL!!!!! a waste of time and not one real fright to be had. buy the original instead 
 One of the most frustrating things about buying and reading parenting or pregnancy books has been the proseltizing, condescening, and dogmatic views so many authors take.  Parenting books would have you believe any other parenting method than their own is tantamount to child abuse.  Pregnancy books would have you believe drinking a Coke or dying your hair should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. This book is the same - OB/GYNs are money grubbers who compromise what is best for mothers and babies, while midwives are all-knowing, altruistic souls who always do the right thing. The author makes no bones about it in the introduction. The author does quote studies, but uses studies showing negative benefit of some action or treatment to argue that the opposite must be superior - lack of data be damned.  If you want a "thinking" guide, look elsewhere.  If you need reassurance that "natural" childbirth is gonna make you and your baby superior to everyone else, go nuts with this one.  
 Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson have a few good moments in the Nick and Jessica Variety Hour. But the show looks too '70s in its premise, too Donny and Marie-ish in some parts and Sonny and Cher-in some others.  Lachey's performance with Babyface is nice. How come Babyface didn't produce Nick's entire solo album instead of the batch of people Nick went to that caused Soul-O to flop?  He would have given him some smooth stuff to sing to. But having Mr. T and Johnny Bench and Kenny Rogers makes the show look, sadly, too 1983-ish. How come they couldn't get somebody current to perform on it, say Maroon 5 or Kanye West, who were both hot last April? They wanted to bring back the variety show format, but it's very hard to do it in an Internet age.  And Jessica isn't all that good on this show. I'd rather hear her music and albums instead. They need to bring new things to the format if they're going to make another show. For now, Lachey and Simpson would be better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this! 
 I agree with many of the other reviewers.  This book seems to have been written by a 12 year old boy.  Simplistic, almost cartoonish, plot and character development.  I found it so unbearable after about 50 pages, it went in the trash 
 Have you ever desperately wanted a book to end but hated leaving it unfinished?  That's the way Sappho's Leap was for me. I finally finished it over the weekend and am still wishing I hadn't spent good money, even bad money, any money on it.  Admittedly, very little is known about the only ancient Greek female poet besides where she probably lived and a few snippets of her poetry. Her words are searing, lovely and sometimes erotic. But Erica Jong's novel fictionalizing her life was banal and boring and droll. Sappho, as her heroine is not only uninteresting, but has no single aspect of her personality that makes me like her. Sure, she experiences heartache and longing, but Jong simply fails to give me a reason to care.  Jong just tells me, flatly, in first person, how Sappho feels and what she thinks, but doesn't make it real for me. She tries to make Sappho into a female Odysseus and can't figure out if the novel should be a fantasy or a semi-believable historical account. And all that wrapped up with a very disappointing, Hollywood ending, tied it off into an unequivocal piece of garbage.  I can't believe Erica Jong has actually written and published eight novels.  It honestly seems like she wrote Sappho's Leap specifically to sell to high school English departments to teach a bit of Greek history with a feminist slant.  Regardless of whatever pocket genre she was trying to exploit, Sappho's Leap is utter tripe 
 I thought by rading all the reviews on this page that it would be a good book...NOT! It wasn't beleivable or very realistic. The whole thing seemed far fetched and questionable. I had to force myself to read it. It was not a good book at all. I saw so many errors in the grammar and spelling throughout the entire book. I can't understand why a publisher would put their name on this book! 
 Brutal, horrible instructions! No pictures! No clear, concise steps to follow.   It took 2 people to set up and just as previous reviewers mentioned, nothing fits properly.  It's very flimsy and unsteady.  I was extremely frustrated and dissapointed in this product so I returned it.  Don't waste your time and money. Spend a little more and get a better product.   
 Here's the scoop:  The stories and essays in the book are hilarious, but the audio version is not an exact duplication of the paper copy - some stories are missing, and others have been added.  That's only part of the problem.  David Sedaris narrates, and he has a very monotone voice.  If you sit there and listen carefully, you'll find the stories quite funny, but if you (like me) do mindless tasks while listening, you'll find yourself tuning out the narration without any effort.  Then you'll have to go back and listen over again, only to tune out the next part.  Amy Sedaris has small voice parts in the stories, and her voice is much better at grabbing attention.  However, her parts are very small.  I wish someone with a more enticing voice was chosen to narrate, because then this audiobook would be a gem 
 This is supposed to be an advanced book.  If I was looking to learn how to put on a c-collar or a KED I'll buy the BTLS book and take that class.  This is supposed to be part of an EMT-P curriculum.  If a paramedic student does not know these things they should be looking elsewhere for a career.  Take the space given for these basic skills and put in some realavent information for advanced providers.  Keep this topic interesting and challenging instead of wasting time with basic first-aid and first responders skills.  We know this stuff! Now we want more!  Everything aside from the waste of time and paper on the basics is actually really great information.  I just want more of it 
 I skimmed through the pages and found a description by the author of how to keep track of large jigsaw puzzles (paraphrased here):  Put the puzzle together, then flip it over and number each piece.  Then store it in a large Ziploc, along with a photo cut out from the box.  Then cut out a small photo from the box and put it in a three-ring binder....etc. First of all, who does a large puzzle more than once?  And how awkward is it to store a puzzle in a bag?  And how does one pick up a large puzzle?  This is not a useful book in my opinion 
 Im not even goig to waste my time reviewing this or any more of my money buying anymore of his cd' 
 A more apt question would be; what do the Okinawans eat or what do the Hunza eat? Those are two healthy, long-lived civilizations. The Swiss rate right up there as well so why not ask what they eat? 
 Terrible, awful, without exception the dullest album I have heard in a long time.  I hadn't heard of this woman, but was recommended to listen to her because I like Diana Krall.  Personally I fail to see any connection between the two.  This is appalling stuff, not a single song raises itself out of the mire of dire musicianship and lack-lustre moaning.  Its one for the bin 
 This item is actually for the purchase of a radio receiver collar not a wireless system. The description is very misleading and should be corrected immediately!! 
 After glancing through the book I was very disappointed.  The introduction told you that this was not a comprehensive guide and it was merely a supplement to other information such as the help and Jim Held's book.  This was not stated in the information on the book.  If that's the case, why not get Jim Held's book? I was particularly interested in iWeb.  The information given for iWeb was sparce.  It merely gave information on setting up a page and importing pictures from iPhoto onto the web page.  It said nothing about links and other important web information.  Perhaps it was on the disk.  I dont know. I never opened the  disk because I knew I wanted to return the book. The only reason I gave it two stars at all was because it said that the disk contained turorials 
 Save your money and just make a guide yourself. This "discussion guide" has only one title page and then four pages of large font bare basic summary with a small sprinkling of questions. If you think that this is weak, you will go on to realize that the last of the four pages is even half taken up with the publisher's logo and information. If you hold the print out close to your ear... you can hear your money being flushed down the drain!! 
 I'll repeat what surprisingly only a few people have mentioned so far. Unless you're an expert in military lingo and with the different types of military hardware you're going to find yourself lost and disinterested.    The first few chapters were actually quite good and laid the groundwork for what I thought would be a good story.  The remaining chapters had little connection to this however.  The book ended up being nothing more than endless military talk, little character development, tedious descriptions of military and submarine encounters.  Even Clancy's much maligned Red Rabbit is far superior to this 
 Janet Malcolm takes a very interesting premise--the relationship of a journalist to his subject--and turns it into a trite essay on the gruesome MacDonald murders.  The book's words seem to indicate that Malcolm,  herself, fell for MacDonald's smooth veneer--she waxes longingly about the  fact that he can break a doughnut and not drop any of the sugar!  Who  cares?  Had she stuck to her subject matter--the relationship between  journalist and the one being written about this could have been a good  book.  But the book's contents indicate to me that Malcolm had another,  hidden agenda that involved her choice of the heinous MacDonald as subject  matter 
 This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I did make it through to the end it took about a week 
 At first you think that this book is going to give you insight into the stardard language as spoken in Britain, Australia, and so on. There is a lot on diversity but we never quite get to the practical side of things and it is all left a bit unclear. What I needed was a straightforward guide for my work, when I travel on business, so I avoid misunderstandings and get the language right when I talk. It would be really helpful if this author could write a book with a description of the standard language for each country and vocabulary lists for the most usual words. You could then look across. I am going to Australia, then I say this, I am going to Britain, then I say this, and so on 
 The other review on this book by "a reader" is very helpful and I recomend you read it as well as this review.  I have taken fifteen CLEP tests and am very familiar with how to study for the test.  CLEP tests by their very nature a designed to see if the student has a sufficient grasp on the given subject. On tests like American literature or Humanities which cover a wide variety of different works/toppics,  I've found that it's best to study the main points and key elements of the subject instead of spending a whole year trying to read a huge list of books.  I would not recomend Rudman's book, however, I would recomend buying the Barron's EZ key's for American Literature.  It will help you get a quick grasp on what this subject covers.  Also, the Official Clep study guide is a great tool for preparing for the tests 
 I have been a subscriber for a few years and have found alot of the articles repetitive and not all that educational. Recently I have subscribed to Shutterbug which is a much better magazine for both the novice and professional photographer. Its articles are insightful and even after many years they still can teach this old photographer a few new tricks !!!! 
 I bought 2 pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet (and never worked again). Very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun 
 I read this book this last year in highschool for English class.  It was awful!  First of all it's really confusing and second of all it's just a stupid plot and ending.  It was so boring and so long.  Don't read it it's a waste of time 
 I used this book during my undergrad years and found it so dry, that I had to drink a few glasses of wisky before I could jump into it. There is no question that the author knows his stuff, and that he has presented alot of  important topics, however, it's just too dry.  To this day, I can't  remember a single thing I learned from that book 
 Wow. I wish there was a way to give this steaming heap a rating of NO stars. O'Reilly is good at what he does and he should stick to it. Fiction is clearly not his strong suit. His characters were cardboard cutouts, his dialogue stilted and ludicris, his situations cliched and riddled with stereotypes, and his schizophrenic writing veers betweeen pompous moralizing and salacious hyperventilation. Reading it made me wonder just how sharp this guy's mind really is. If this trash is any indication of O'Reilly's true worldview, he's a sick, sad man indeed 
 Then this method will work for you because it requires you to memorize a 500 something word script.  
 I have read and enjoyed James Patterson in the past, but can honestly say that this will be the last Patterson book I will read.  I was truly disappointed in the lack of storytelling and writing ability.  The book had no depth, and the story suffered for it.  As I read the book I got the impression that Mr. Patterson was simply trying to crank out a book as quickly as possible, and could not be bothered with such things as descriptive detail or creative plotting.  I did not find the characters or their behavior to be believable.  
 This is a good book for someone who has never delved into the subject.  I find that it follows the same track as others in making the golden proportioning system fit about anything they want it to.  Probably the most disappointing thing is the book's assembly:  there are numerous overlays in the book that are not aligned with the images they are overlaying.  The deviations are from slight to almost 1/4" - very bothersome to view. This is more of a problem with mediocre quality control and concern by Princeton Architectural Press.  It's good that the book is relatively inexpensive or I would have returned it 
 While this is a great movie, this DVD reproduction does it severe injustice. The sound track is out of sync and the production quality of the DVD is marginal 
 The depression era introduction was the best part of this movie as another reviewer mentioned. From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes. I kept hoping they would succeed in killing him so the pain of this awful movie would end 
 Whilst I do like Jessica and Nick, (I was a fan of Jessica since "I'm gonna love you forever" and I always liked 98degrees), this is embarrasing.    On Newlyweds, I think she's actually funny.  I love the show and I don't see the negatives that people talk about.  This however was different.  I can't beleive they need the money, so Jessica and Nick - DON"T DO THIS AGAIN.  I couldn't believe they did such stupid rubbish and kept a straight face.  It's fine to do songs along with other famous singers, but don't sing with a car, and don't do pole-vaulting across the stage and then act high at other times.    Yes there are some good moments in this, but overall,?  I was cringing considerably 
 You'd be better off using the internet to figure the game out. The guide feels super cluttered, it's almost hard to read and it doesn't tell you everything at the right time. I think it feels cluttered because there's too many pictures in it. Every page has at least 7 or 8 images on it. The best thing about the guide is the production value but I didn't buy for that 
 This book and the great mass of the photos relate not to the garage, ie, a covered space where cars are stored or where a hobbyist workshop is located, but converted space or living space above a garage.  If you're interested in creative garage layout, workshop arrangement, automobile-related storage, etc., this is not the book.  If your desire is to turn a hardworking garage into a granny flat, this is for you 
 First Class were singer-for-hire Tony Burrows (Edison Lighthouse, Flying Machine, Brotherhood of Man) and studio musicians. Apart from "Beach Baby", an inspirred bit of Beach Boys pastiche that sounded great on the radio in 1974, the rest is pretty much middling fare. You'll find "Beach Baby" and an additional First Class track or two in better company on "Bubblegum Classics, Vol. 5" 
 The clappy-happy endorsements of this book are unbelievable shills- like the book itself. Keep looking. There are much better books out there. And no, Heiman doesn't need it, and Tom Hopkins is definately not the pick of the litter 
 I love Judith Mcnaught's work.  Her historicals are stellar one-of-kind novels that pull at your heart strings.  In my opinion all of her historicals are winners.  SOME of her contemporary works are fabulous as well - Perfect and Paradise to name a few.  There are other contemporary flops though (Remember When, Triumphant Heart, etc).  Every Breath You Take was such a disappointment.  The plot, character development, and writing was not up to par. I found it very hard to believe that a couple could fall in love in 2 days, be separated for two years and then fall back in love instantly upon meeting again.  It was really forced.  Someone mentioned it was "amatuerish" and I have to agree.  I think anyone could have written this novel.  I understand that the book was rushed, and to tell you the truth it reads like a novel that was written in a mad dash.  I love Judith but this book was just terrible 
 Oh how I wish for a balanced view.  For all of his past credentials as an investigative journalist, Mr. Hersh is no biographer. The network of sources and investigative attention to detail that exposed the horrors of My Lai and made Mr.Hersh's reputation become nothing more than a platform for a commercially-motivated thrashing of a flawed man who happened to be president for less than 3 years, forty years ago, and whose greatest claim to fame is that he was assassinated in highly suspicious circumstances - thus entering a uniquely American form of popular-mythology. Mr.Hersh contributes nothing that is substantively new to our knowledge of JFK. His book produces a litany of "evidence" to support the well-known view that Kennedy was seriously-ill for much of his life and often resorted to heavy drug use, was a political animal who made much use of the often dubious network of contacts that his super-ambitious father had developed and was an insatiable womaniser behind the veneer of a "respectable marriage". The book makes no serious contribution to anything other than Mr.Hersh's bank account (and that of his publisher) because it seems that anything that is written about the icons of American popular culture, whether good or bad, is destined to be a commercial success - all the more so when it is written by a "respected investigative journalist" 
 Altho the 747 was a mouthful... it left a bad taste in my mouth.  I needed a light read... too bad the oxygen masks did not operate... maybe some literary talent could have been breathed into this book.  
 How does one get through verbiage such as the following?  "This [the above paragraph] approach to sexual cultural works within a tradition of social construction and symbolic interaction that explains variations in sexual culture in terms of cultural vocabularies, social organization, and social interaction. My approach is agnostic to the popular claims of evolutionary psychology that sexual drives are biologically programmed for mate selection."  (page 7)  Mr. Farrer's book could have been easily shortened to one hundred pages had he eliminated the obtuse, sociological jargon. The book's main attraction is the combination of "China" and "sex" in the title. Adding "market reform" didn't hurt.   I have no problem with this book if it were listed as "pop culture."  What makes this book questionable is Mr. Farrer's attempt to portray his bar hopping observations as a scholarly work.   Chinese terms in pin yin are sprinkled throughout the book. Yet these terms are simple Chinese words used in everyday conversation. They have no special bearing on the material except to impress the non-Chinese speaker.  There is no analysis of Chinese sexual mores prior to 1949. Mr. Farrer shows an embarrassing ignorance of Chinese sexual sophistication in spite of listing a bibliography of 252 references.  He makes no comparison of the effects fascism/communism and democracy have on the sexual behavior of a society.   Had he studied Spain, Taiwan, and South Korea as they changed from their conservative authoritarian government, he would have noted similar characteristics with Shanghai society.  Mr. Farrer's book gives a superficial description of a country and people who are going through a great social and economic change. However, his methodology of visiting bars, nighclubs, and dance halls to understand this change is ludicrous.   In 1979,  I worked in Shanghai, China for two years. I returned ten years ago to live in Beijing.  I have seen China before and during its dramatic change. I have also witnessed the social effects of these changes, namely, in the sexual area.  Many of the observations Mr. Farrer makes are well known to Westerners who have resided in China. Mr. Farrer's fascination with his topic is like the young boy who just "discovered" sex.  The reader may find the description of Shanghai's night life and the characters in the book interesting but, I am sure their eyes will glaze over as they read Mr. Farrer's sociological analysis.        
 the show lost it's zip by season 7. the chemistry wasn't the same. the scripts had gotten watered down&you could sense a show just going through the motions on quite a few of these episodes.the show had it's last real peak during Season 4.i still enjoy watching the show though 
 Not only are the other comments on the printing quality correct, but the EXACT SAME BOOK EXISTS in a 2006 EDITION!!  The "Science of Sex" is the original(?) 1996 edition.  The 2006 edition of the VERY SAME BOOK is titled, "Sperm Wars: Infidelity, Sexual Conflict, and Other Bedroom Battles".  Explain to me why the author would reprint his original book under a new title?  Anyway, I'm returning this one, since I bought both books at the same time, thinking they had entirely different content. Furthermore the new edition is of much better printed quality, with none of the problems mentioned about this edition.  One more thing of note...the new edition is HALF THE PRICE of this crappy version!!!  Can't wait to actually read it 
 I did not care fot this book as you can gain all he has to say y just reading the lost books of the bibl 
 This book is rather brief. This book is like a brief assortment of topics.  It didn't help me much. For time management (which possibly is the greatest skill that any student must master), the authors just mention very briefly.   
 I understand that the Dept of Defence has raised the age for joining the US Army to 39. By the time this President "prevails" I expect to see the joining age somewhere around 65.  A directionless voyage into the rudderless meanderings of what once was a great country 
 Although it gives some style suggestions it is almost useless if you have less than 500 square feet (whichs studios in NYC generally are smaller than). If you are looking for some helpful ways to reconsider your small space, I'd recommend "Apartment Therapy." If you want some nice photos, then try this book 
      As an Australian and a good friend of several Pacific Islanders, I was quite offended by this book.  Theroux makes sweeping generalizations about Australians, New Zealanders, and Pacific Islanders that are derogatory and border on racism.  This book was written at a time when Theroux was very depressed, as he freely admits, and therefore has a great deal of negative bias.  Although he does pick up a measure of optimism as he goes through the book, it is impossible to know how much of his discription can really be trusted.  Slightly amusing, but not for those interested in what Oceania is really like 
 Let's be frank, shall we? This mock sci-fi is just one more take on "can't we all just get along".  How transparent.  Dress up the black guy in a silly rubber suit and pretend he's an ALIEN.  Involve him in SPORTS!  There aren't many films that make me curse out loud, but this is one of them.  Treacly and brain-dead beyond endurance, the only thing that might have saved it would have been a spirited rendition by poor Gossett of "It Isn't Easy Being Green".  One of the other reviewers mentioned Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune in HELL IN THE PACIFIC. I couldn't agree more. That film, essentially the same thing, is immeasurably better.  Do yourself a favor: skip this exploitive garbage and watch either HELL IN THE PACIFIC or some genuine science fiction. 
 This is a cute book, but it's useless.  I won't let my 7 month old use it because I'm afraid the sharp edges of the book will cut his mouth (or hands, or legs).  
 You have to be truly annoying to write a book so bad that I keep reading despite myself, until I finish it. You have to be transcendently annoying for the book to be so bad that I feel compelled to spend four minutes of my life giving it a bad review. Chuck Klosterman, take a bow. You are truly annoying.  The quickest, surest, easiest way to be so annoying is to be shrill and self-justifying while expressing a series of opinions that are not merely idiotic, but willfully ignorant. Congratulations, Chuck Klosterman. You took the easy route to getting on my nerves, and the nerves of anybody who knows anything about real heavy metal music.   I shall summarize: he thinks Poison and Guns and Roses and the like are better than Priest or Danzig. Poison. Better than Priest. GNR. Better than Danzig. Or Metallica.   I kid you not.   Uh, let's see if I can come up with a metaphor, for those not familiar with the bands in question. Here goes: This is like saying, uh, that Stephen King is better than Shakespeare. Or that Andy Warhol is better than Michelangelo.  Get it? It's just stupid, and almost intentionally so. You can't argue with somebody like this. They're not worth it.  What is most annoying, of course, is that a lot of people agree with him and also make their annoying noises and write their annoying words until one just can't help but swat at these mosquitoes...  Okay, time's up. If I prevented one intelligent heavy metal fan from wasting time on this tar-baby of a book, it was worth it 
 It's pretty rich for Pat to write a book about the ten commandments when he doesn't even follow them himself. Last time I checked, "Thou shall not murder" was one of the big ten. 
 Lazlo trys, probably as well as anyone, to use science, his rational mind and a touch of intuition, to explain all of creation. These tools cannot do the job. If only Lazlo had juxaposed his generally well thought out theories with appropriate passages from ancient scriptures, then he would have shown us how well today's science can be used to explain creation. For some reason, scientists are loathe to make specific references to, say, the Vedas. Seems that scientists are totally committed to using their relatively crude tools to penetrate into the mysteries of life, but without much success. 
 I would like to read about more complex spells than the ones in here. This should be for beginners learning magic 
 This book was not at all what I expected from Brands, who was a Pulitzer Prize finalist for his biography of Benjamin Franklin, First American.  In trying to make an academic biography accessible to the reading public, Brands' writing suffers greatly and becomes far too colloquial.  At one point, when discussing Indian-White relations, he goes so far as to call the whites "Palefaces."  It was a chore to get through, and while it heightened my knowledge of Jackson, nothing was particularly memorable except what I already knew or, perhaps, the actions I disagreed with (his invasion of Florida or his use of martial law after the Battle of New Orleans).  Particularly when discussing Jackson's historically far reaching actions, such as kicking the Cherokees out of Georgia, or his battle with Biddle and eventual destruction of the Bank of the United States, Brands does a deplorable job of explaining what happened.  Elements of background, and why Jackson did whatever it was he did exactly, as the reader will be confused on that point, are conspicuously missing.  I have read similarly poor reviews of another biography by Brands, TR: The Last Romantic, and if First American is at all similar in style, I know why he didn't win that Pulitzer 
 The devil/satan, lusting after ones mother, is it a dream, is it reality, can rosemary see the future - so boring!!!!!!!! Not worth the paper it was printed on. Lucky I got mine from the library...... 
 This movie is somewhat difficult to rate in my opinion because there are some good things about "Clownhouse" and some bad things about it.  The movie starts out with a young boy named Casey who is for somereason very afraid of clowns...he wets his bed when he has nightmares about them.  It appears the boy is about 11 years old and he has two brothers named Geoffery and Randy, probably 13 and 16 respectively.  Geoffery is sympathetic towards Casey while Randy is a total jerk and seems determined to torment them both.  Well, a carnival comes into town and Casey apprehensively goes along, but his fear of clowns is incredible.  In this movie, it turns out that his fear was well warranted.  At first, I thought this movie was going to be another "The Funhouse" but it was not.  That being said, "The Funhouse" is superior in every way to "Clownhouse".    As "Clownhouse" moves along, the viewer notices three individuals who appear to be quite malevolent in nature.  Indeed, these three men kill three clowns and dress up in their clown costumes.  The killing scenes were below average and not very effective at all.  What takes place afterwards is a long and sometimes boring chase scene where the clowns follow Casey back to his home.  The chase scenes are quite ridiculous to be honest with you...there is no way that Casey could have outrun these grown men and there is also no way that Casey would not have heard them running behind him.  Ultimately, the scenes move to Casey's house where the horror in this film really takes place.    Frankly, the clowns did not appear to be that scary to me at all...in fact, at times, they looked stupid!.  When one considers the great horror movie villains of the past, the clowns looked pretty weak as far as horror movie villains are concerned, and as a result, these clowns were not very effective in creating horror in and of themselves; but, that being said, Salva does a good job of putting the clowns in position in the house unbeknownst to the boys and that is where this movie is effective as horror movie and becomes quite creepy.  However, this is not enough to put this movie over the hump as a really good horror movie.  I thought the moving around and the boys' lack of knowledge of the clowns in the two story house was quite effective and at times, the movie was quite chilling in this respect, but this is really all the movie has to offer.   Once the clowns were discovered however, the movie declined in the level of horror that it had created and this is a sign of an inferior horror movie in my opinion with respect to the classics at least.  Moreover, I thought the times when the clowns actually engaged the young boys in combat were pretty lame...the three men would have easily killed these boys, but I suppose it wouldn't work if that happened, but I think that the movie would have been more effective and credible if the three boys in this movie were older...say, 17, 18 and 19.  Then, one as a viewer, might be willing to "buy" how the young boys disposed of the clowns.    Another flaw of the movie is the acting in this movie is clearly below average and there is little character development except for Casey.  The characters did not provide the movie with enough of a foundation by which the viewer can actually appreciate the movie as a whole and not just based on it's horror values...in other words, the movie just wasn't very well done or directed as a whole.  Indeed, I did not think that the choice of three brothers was very effective as far as characters are concerned, especially being as young as they were.  I thought it was a little much trying to mesh the personalities of the three brothers into such a short movie.  But, like I said, it is hard to rate "Clownhouse" as there really are some chilling moments when the clowns enter the house unbeknownst to the young boys, but that being said, this movie is not without major flaws and all and all, I can only reluctantly endorse this movie as a horror movie worth renting,but cannot really suggest that this movie is worth owning.  2.35 STARS for this flick which in my grading system is about average.  I hope this review is helpful for you in determining the pros and cons of this movie while also explaining the plot without giving away too much of the movie.  
 I was enjoying this trilogy for the most part, until I got to the ending.  Then it really fell apart.  The whole point of doing "alternative universe" stories is to shake things up.  Witness the marvelous Buffy episode, "The Wish."  Yeah, the Magic Reset Button was pushed at the end of that episode but look at what happened in the Wishverse.  A simple premise, "What if Buffy Summers never went to Sunnydale?"  The status quo was shaken up, with Willow and Xander being vampires, the Master ruling Sunnydale, Buffy being cold, and just about everybody dying at the end.    Now here we have the premise, "What if Dark Willow stayed evil?"  And apparently the answer is, "Nothing at all, the Buffyverse remains exactly the same."  The only thing this trilogy did was insert some extra story between "Two to Go" and "Grave."  To end this story in EXACTLY the same way that "Grave" ended, with very minor changes, is unacceptable for an "alternative history" story.  What was the point of bringing Spike and Oz into this story at all? They were prisoners, then after they were freed they mostly disappeared.  I so badly wanted to see Oz go off on Willow for turning him into a werewolf but that scene never happened.  Such a wasted opportunity.  Spike was completely useless outside of one "deus ex vampira" moment.  And both of them were complete non-factors in the ending.    I flipped to the last page, and all I could think was "such wasted potentinal."  This book definitely needed a different ending.  Avoid this trilogy.  Or at least demand that the author rewrite this book 
 I was very unhappy with this product. First the shipping took way too long. Second, the tube is much smaller than sold at Macy's and the cost is more. And the contents were gross, very goopy. Not smooth. Like it had been sitting a hot warehouse for months. I'll fight the mall to buy this next time 
 This gets 1 star for the simple fact that it doesn't seem to fit my Mark II body properly. 
 This book is devoid of humor or insight. Save your money and apply it towards "Adventure Capitalist" by Jim Rogers.  I wish I had 
 I don't understand the motivation of authors that claim the USS Liberty attack was anything but accidental. Sure they'll get some sales from the neo-Nazi conspiracy nuts, but isn't being honest more important?  In short this book still can't answer the $64,000 question of why ISrael would purposely attack their ONLY ally in 1967.  If this friendly fire incident were something else, the US would not have begun giving military aid to Israel, (they started this policy in 1968) Israel and the United States are 2 of a kind, they have the courage to fight terrorism, and this book is simply making up a conspiracy that never happened.  Don't quit your day job Anthony Pearson, whatever it is 
 The brewing instructions in this book were rudimentary at best, and the use of raw eggs in many of the drinks is questionable.  Overall, I found that the book focussed far too much on recipes for sodapop, herbal teas, fruit-juices and Starbucks-like coffee recipes.  The larger portion of the recipes in this books are Mz. Telesco's own concoctons. I was expecting more recipes for traditional drinks such as ale, mead, wine, etc...  but, the recipes that they did give contained very brief,simplistic brewing instructions that had me a bit worried. This book was a bit dissappointing, really.  If you like fanciful, sweet drinks and are not concerned with their religious and historical authenticity, then by all means, buy this book.  Otherwise, save your money and get The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible, a far more accurate and thorough guide 
 The main thing I learnt from this book is that it is definitely better sometimes to look through a book before buying it. I thought this was a very juvenile book, in terms of the level of smearing and name calling I thought there was, e.g. the False Memory Syndrome Foundation is described as "the CIA's answer to the flat earth society"and Col John Alexander is given the epithet "Doctor of Death". Some child abuse cases are recounted with an unnecessary level of graphic detail, and the author includes a partially obscured picture of a scene of child pornography. I wondered if this was really needed, but then I remembered that the publisher is Feral House, which also publishes books by Satanist Anton LaVey and the Apocalypse Culture books, which also feature child porn. Instead of blaming the CIA for everything, Mr Constantine could also have pointed the finger at his publisher for potentially encouraging Satanism and child abuse.   I don't really want to spend more time saying what I didn't like about this book, but I didn't like the way the author seemed to be so sure of himself. Some examples: all UFOs are manmade, all "alien" abductions are CIA abductions, remote viewing is the CIA beaming images into people's heads. 
 What's so mind-boggling is the drugs that Kinsella must have been smoking in order to come up with this one.  Now read this description of the book: An albino, like his dead father, is convinced that a 3000 inning game took place 80-some years ago between the Chicago Cubs and the Iowa baseball Confederacy All-stars.  The albino is somehow able to go back in time and witness the game (as a matter of fact the local hicks use him as a good-luck charm and rub his head before stepping to the plate, allowing him to remain in the dugout) in all its glory. Then Teddy Roosevelt shows up and takesa few swings, telling the pitcher not to patronize him after throwing an easy pitch, and then making a cheap pun about the bat being a "big stick."  Soon after that Leonardo DaVinci showed up in a balloon and watches a few innings.  Shortly thereafter a giant flood occurs and some of the players spontaeneouly throw themselves in the waters.  To fill the vacancies, a statue of an angel plays in the outfield.  There, I think I've covered all the bases, so to speak.  Oh, I forgot the Native America named "Drifting Away" who is messing with the reality of this county and eventually plays in the game too.  Look, I don't like to be so completely negative, but the book was ludicrous.  To make matters worse, it throws in a fairly gratuitous love interest who is the spitting image of the Albino protagonist's mother (kinda Fruedian) and more seemingly random things than could possibly be mentioned in this review. And bear in mind, reading these things, that I'm a baseball fan.   3/1 
 This recording is not great company.  I'm really confused: is it a Broadway recording or a very poor amatuer recording?  And if so, did this rubbish actually make it to the Broadway stage?  I feel for the people that saw it, and were expecting the rich full melodies that Sondheim produced for this show.  The Musical Director for this abomination should be called a Mutilation Director, because that is precisely what he did to the music of this show.  So the only advice I give to future Musical Directors that want to revive and revamp a show: If it's not broke, please, please, please don't try and fix it!  Some things are just perfect the way they are.  Don't buy this CD.  I did and it is now a coaster where it gets better use 
 One good thing about this movie is that it helped me find religion.  It was so bad that I actually wrote a prayer:  Oh great and loving God, take mercy upon this, the lowliest of your creatures.  Burn my brain, I beseech thee... yeah with fire, acid, turpentine, and super-hot hot sauce lay waste to the portion of my brain which remembers having viewed "Point Blank" with Mickey Rourke!  Keep me safe and guide my steps far, far from future viewings, so that in thy mercy I might instead feast upon broken glass and burning hot lava, and smear my naked buttox with honey and lay me upon a hill of ants rather than ever see this film again.  Amen.  Like many of you, I first came across this little gem while searching for the 1967 masterpiece of funkadelic nihilism starring Lee Marvin.  Well, of course THAT'S not out of DVD yet, but since I'm a huge fan of Mickey Rourke (for reasons which, as his career progresses, I find more and more difficult to remember), I thought "Wow, Mickey Rourke just re-made one of the coolest movies of all time... might be worth watching."  Boy, was THAT a mistake!  First of all, this IS NOT a remake of Lee Marvin/John Boorman's Point Blank.  That's two strikes against Rourke, because he ALSO starred in "Bullet," a stupid piece of crap which had nothing to do with Steve McQueen's "Bullit," another of the great guy films of all time.  It's about a bunch of escaped convicts who are really bad and blow some stuff up and are at a mall and Mickey Rourke Kills them.  'Nuff said re the plot.  One thing that really sticks out about this film is that Rourke, typically a pretty muscular dude, is positively STEROIDAL!  I mean, he put on SO MUCH muscle for this role that his skin literally looks as if it's going to fissure and peel off!  I don't know what he was on, but it must be something we normally use on farm animals 
 This book is not very helpful and confusing to use. A lot of the information it provides is information you can read on the food labels IF you buy those brands. 
 The fact that a book like this is popular in academic circles is a sure sign that the Computer Science Academics are corrupt beyond redemption. If there are corporations who allow this book in as a tutorial for their workers those corps are wasting their money. This is a dictionary not a textbook... and its not even a good dictionary at that.  Reading this book on a subject so amusingly simple like methodology is like trying to eat with your nose. The fact that Mr. Pressman over complicates, obfuscates and ambiguates the subject matter is proof that he is terribly insecure about the simplicity of the subject or he is just not good at explaining things. Then to have this book be touted as a standard is a shame.   If anyone wants to see mastery of subject matter coupled with references to specs. and clear explanations they should try the Head First Series (on design patterns). Mr. Pressman should follow some of his own advices when giving guidance to his students about writing design/requirements docs. This book is worse than a use case document scrawled in Tahitian 
 The "It's the 2000's and everything is going to be great because nothing can go wrong" theme was the opposite of what I was looking for.   I'm interested in books that give solid detailed steps to take when preparing for your financial future and this book seems to have a "don't worry about it" kind of tone. I found it pretty worthless.  As if he just wrote a book that told people what they wanted to hear in order to get them to by the book.  (... 
 and this book sends the message that it is.  Borrowers don't "borrow" things; they steal them.  This book teaches kids that, as long as you don't get caught, taking things that don't belong to you is a-okay.  Being "seen" is, after all, the only thing that Borrowers worry about 
 Did I miss something, or did this guy risk his life based on a promise to someone he just met? Too much irrational behavior to mention.  I had to force myself to finish the book just to see how much more ridiculous it could get.  The (paperback) cover refers to Michael Crichton three times, the praises inside, another three, and one reference to Stephen King.  These are two good authors that I enjoy reading but this book was not even close.  
 Barber's trenchant jargon updates slogans for class-warfare and utopian proletarian dictatorships. The rhetoric relies on emotion to bridge logical leaps, hides a distain for cause and effect relationships and sidesteps questions about human nature.  Instead, Barber carelessly brews a mix of hip buzzwords and mass marketing clich. If you read this tome, be prepared for endless repetition of 'the capitalist is dangerous, but united the people cannot be defeated':  Repeat the following 5 or 10 times and you have the book in a nutshell: "Jihad pursues a bloody politics of identity, McWorld a bloodless economics of profit. Belonging by default to McWorld, everyone is a consumer; seeking a repository for identity everyone belongs to some tribe. But no one is a citizen. Without citizens, how can there be ..." {fill in the blank with any utopian quality: justice, happiness, equality, etc.}  The central problem for 21st century Marxists is updating the logic of class struggle.  In the first half of the 19th century Marx taught a strict evolutionary progression from noble-savage to slavery, from slavery to feudalism, and from feudalism to capitalism.  Within a few years, Marx predicted, capitalism would collapse and the unavoidable socialist utopia would emerge.  Of course, the collapse didn't happen and Marxist have been rationalizing ever since.  Lenin had to add the Imperialist phase.  21st century Marxist need to show imperialism mutating into  global consumerism.   Towards this end, Barbour argues: 1. Capitalists have shed their 'nationalist' identity, finding it easier to enslave the proletariat via media manipulation. 2. Media manipulation (global consumerism) seeks to replace indigenous cultural identities with slavish loyalty to global products.   3. 'Wild Capitalism' promoting global products causes criminal damage to indigenous communities, and threatens environmental catastrophe.  4. Protecting these indigenous communities (victims) will require violence (socialist revolution).  Hidden beneath this victim-oppressor dualism lies the traditional Marxist faith in central planning or 'government by intellectuals.' Democracy can be dismissed because the 'means of communication' are held by the multinational capitalist elite.  And, Marxist don't need an elections, as intellectuals they already know what is best for everyone else. Thus, Barber spends the second half of the book describing the failures of democracy. Barber asserts that "the epoch on whose threshold we stand -- post communist, postindustrial, post national, yet sectarian, fearful, and bigoted -- is likely also to be terminally post democratic."   Time has not been kind to Barber. His 1995 predictions of post-democratic cultures has failed to materialize.  The 90s were not a decade of American decline.  Despite his attempts to be hip and techno-savvy, he entirely misses the dot com craze and  blogosphere. Further, failed to address the rise of Islamofascism.  He calls commercialism all sham, but relies entirely upon its rhetoric.  Consider the cover photo, why is the girl wearing so much makeup behind a chador?  How is she getting the Pepsi through the chador to here lips? The book has nothing to do with Islam, it is just a marketing sham about marketing shams.  In the end, it sell 'Barber, the hip international intellectual' and little else 
 michelle zacharias , i totally agree with you. I can believe the ruined such a good movie qith such a terrible ending, Im looking for the hollywood version as well, for I think that jacqes should have learnt the lesson with enzos suicide and value life, especially when he is going to have a child from the beautifull woman he loves 
 Excellent book, especially for a first time dog owner.. 
 There are two very good songs on this album: Man In A Box (duh) and Love, Hate, Love. The slow-brewing intensity of the latter song sets it apart from the straight-up metal of the rest of the album. I really liked AIC back in the day and think both Cantrell and Staley are great talents, but I could never get into this album. Dirt, Sap, and Jar of Flies are all superior to Facelift so if you're new to AIC check those works out first 
 This film is boring, so much so that I could only take 35 minutes of it before I was forced to push stop. This is a soap opera about politics & oil companies. It's weird jump around style is confusing & pointless...do yourself a favor and don't bother w/ this garbage 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 This is a bad, bad, bad, bad book.  It isn't about how to write stories - it's a motivation book.   It's also a commiserating companion for the struggling writer who can't come up with anything and doesn't know why.  This book is a perfect example of what's wrong with most writing books out there.    Sound harsh?  Well, maybe.  But a book on writing should teach one how to write a decent story - not push tired, pseudo-mystical ideas like:  "the story just sort of takes shape on its own".  This isn't any help.  In fact, it's worse than "no help" - it's hurtful because it encourages an aspiring writer to stay ignorant of the craft - the CRAFT - of storytelling.    Stephen Koch clearly doesn't understand what makes a good story , or how a good story is written.  His advice is ludicrous, amounting to gems like: "Stories make themselves known, they reveal themselves - even to their tellers - only by being told.  You may ask how on earth you can tell a story before you know it.  You do that by letting the emerging story tell itself through you."  What a bunch of malarkey!  To claim that a that a story exists "somewhere" and all the writer has to do is "find it" is probably the stupidest thing I've read.  It's like saying a sculpture exists and the welder just has to find it.  Or that the painted masterpiece is already painted - you just have to let it come through you.    Nonsense.  A story doesn't exist until someone CREATES it.  And Stephen Koch either doesn't know that, or doesn't know how one creates a story.  His advice "let the story tell itself through you" is very, very bad.  Would you tell an aspiring cabinet-maker to "just let the cabinet come THROUGH you?"  No!  The guy would probably make the ugliest cabinet ever.  Either that or he would saw his fingers off because he didn't know what he was doing.  He would waste time, effort, and money - which is what YOU'LL do if you buy this book.    Now I recognize that storytelling is a tad different from cabinetmaking.  But they both have principles one must follow in order to succeed.  A good cabinet must be balanced, sturdy, and square.  A good story must have characters, conflict, and ultimately show us something universal about life in an emotional way.   What's more, Stephen Koch's advice is really nothing more than a collection of tired advice from writers more successful than him.  He quotes Stephen King and Ray Bradbury frequently, as well as just about any other big-name writer he can, whenever they have a quote he can lift and use to support his view.  It's hard to say if he's learned anything on his own, or is just parroting advice he's read in other books.    Also - This book is called "The Modern Library Writer's Workshop" but you'll find nothing at all like a workshop, unless you count the occasional gripe from a struggling writer.  There is VERY little craft mentioned in here, and most everything Koch talks about is in vague generalities.  Most workshops would have you do exercises or assignments.  Not here.  That's fine, but one of the best ways to get someone writing is to give them a push in the right direction.  Beginning books on woodworking (sorry for the continued comparison) often give the plans for a small box or stool that the beginner can hone his skills on before moving on to complicated pieces of furniture.   It stands to reason that a writer might be better off trying to write short stories before he or she tries to tackle a novel.  But Koch has no such advice.    In conclusion, stay far, far away from this book.  I bought it on a whim because I didn't have enough time or opportunity to really look at it.  But I'm sorry I bought it now.  Save your money and look elsewhere.  
 Slightly above a toy but definately not a sewing machine for anything serious. I ended up hemming my sleeves by hand. Bobbin is loose. Doesn't pull the material through very well. Not at all what I had hoped. I will end up giving this away and buying a real sewing machine. One that will handle a hem. 
 Before I started reading "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance," the book had a lot going for it: stellar reviews on the cover, an intriguing title and its status as one of five or six books found in the meager philosophy section at Walden Books in Pocatello.  Unfortunately, despite these advantages, the book failed to deliver anything but ambiguity and disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't terrible, it just wasn't very good.  I'm not sure whether the book is a memoir, a novel or a philosophical treatise. In "Zen" Robert Pirsig tells the story of a motorcycle trip he went on with his son, Chris in the 1970s. But the story, I guess, is not really about the bike trip itself but the thoughts the author has about quality and technology.  The only interesting passage of the whole book can be found on page  17:      "The Buddha, the Godhead, resides quite as comfortably in the circuits of a computer or the gears of a cycle transmission as he does at the top of a mountain or in the petals of a flower."  That passage is good. The rest of the book is depressing and confusing. Throughout the entire motorcycle trip, the author ignores his son and becomes lost in his own head thinking deep thoughts about the definition of "quality."   I'm not sure if this book was intended as a novel, but if it was, it failed to produce character growth. It's standing as a work of philosophy is not much better. The author's ideas could have been explained in a 20 page essay and been much clearer.   Whatever the book was supposed to be, it didn't impressed me.  
 "Starting a Small Restaurant" gives any novice a good starting point for considerations in this fast-paced world. The Author, Daniel Miller, has had mixed career employment, not all of which are in the food service industry. Danial co-founded the Grey Fox Inn, a large undertaking. I gave the book 2 stars because on some subjects Miller is simply vague or incorrect in my experience. For instance, Miller states that "People steal food from restaurants." Not necessarily true, but only gives solutions of locking storage areas (ludicrous), or deal honestly with employees, whatever that means. Another subject I found unenlightening was the equipment discussion on a deep fat fryer. Dirty and dangerous was about as far as the text went.  It is a good book, just keep in mind that there are other solutions than the ones Miller advises 
 That is a really good book for the beginer of toxicologist. However, there are many errors existed and those errors could mislead and confuse the beginer. I think that we'd better wait for next editions 
 The voice on the tape is not very engaging, however the story as always is great.  Better to read it to a younger child than to play the tape.  An older child may be better able to follow the story on audio cassette 
 	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, by Charles Dickens, is a story of love and compassion, which takes place during the beginnings of the French Revolution. Despite the fact that many aspects of the revolution are portrayed well in the novel, the book is still a tiring read and requires a strong liking for Dickens' writing style.  	Throughout the novel, Dickens bogs the story down with excessive descriptions and meaningless scenes. The language is relatively simple and easy to comprehend, but the extra descriptions make the novel difficult to fully understand. Most of the characters in the novel are completely unrealistic, which makes it difficult for the reader to relate to what is going on. The character of Lucie Manette, is portrayed as the perfect women with absolutely no flaws. Her character is the supposed epitome for women, but in truth, is highly improbable. Throughout the novel, Dickens' does a great job at keeping the story dry and unentertaining, giving little to no excitement to cause the reader to want to continue. Despite these countless imperfections, Dickens' does manage to be partially successful in his quest to portray the revolution.  	The book, with all its shortcomings, did reveal to the reader, the atrocities that occurred during the French Revolution, and the events that led to it. The abuse of the nobles, and the radical ideas of the revolutionists are all shown in many parts of the novel. The one other aspect that Dickens got right in his novel was the character of Sydney Carton. Sydney Carton is the only character in the story that many readers can relate too and understand a variation of what Carton feels. Carton is a lawyer who feels that everything he has done in his life has been wrong and believes that he can do no good in life. This characteristic is common among people, and Dickens manages to capture that aspect of humanity precisely.   	The novel, A Tale of Two Cities, is a slow moving book with numerous flaws that cause the reader to lose interest fairly often. Dickens' overuse of description and unrealistic characters add to the book's dryness. However, Dickens does capture a time in history with great accuracy. This is a book for a reader who likes Dickens' overzealous descriptions and enjoys slow moving stories. 
 what a joke...people believe the stupidest things...do some research and you will see that this is a joke.  I hated it 
 When she utters the line "I feel so violated"...Reba is totally inept as an actress in this movie.  THe story is inspiring and uplifting but McEntire is no actress.  She is a complete and total failure which bogs the movie down.  Its a shame they couldn't have had a "real" actress play this part.  THe movie would have been wonderful and worthy of a five star rating.  The supporting cast is o.k. but when they play off McEntire they look inept.  SHe makes them look bad.  I'm sorry but acting is not McEntire's forte.  
 I had to respond to the previous review.  I think this is the perfect place to point out the greed of the movie studios.  Why else would they release a box set where 4 of the 5 titles were previous available?  Also, see the new Mel Brooks box set.  You will have to buy that just to get titles such as "High Anxiety" and "Silent Movie".  How about the deluxe Scarface edition from a few years ago, that was the only way to get the original Scarface (1932) on DVD.  There are many more examples. Don't get me started on the habit or releasing special editions only months after the first edition came out.  Enough is enough! I don't agree that we have to rate the movies (of course they are 5 star films), I can go to Maltin, or elsewhere, for reviews. What's nice about this forum is we can get peer assessments of DVD content, extra features, transfer quality, audio quality, etc.  That's useful. ... P.S. it's Matthew McConaughe 
 Cleary, no one ever taught Mr. Freehling to do research!  This is the most asinine book ever written about the "late unpleasantness."  First, the states of the Upper South were definately NOT Anti-Confederate!  Anyone who claims as much has lacked the historical studies to pass a history class, let alone have a book published which some will take seriously!  Lincoln arrested Secessionists in Maryland, which kept the state from seceding from the Union.  And, both Missouri and Kentucky joined the Confederacy late in 1861.  There are 13 stars on the Confederate flag, there were 13 Secessions, and 13 states of the Confederacy.  Missouri and Kentucky were, though, occupied throughout the war, with Kentucky being liberated briefly during the war.  This book lacks consistency, and perpetuates a biased and untrue history [someone should think of our children when they write this garbage].  If I had the capabilities of giving it no stars in a rating, I would enthusiastically do so.  Don't buy this book, look for another 
 I found this movie somewhat entertaining, although the intertwining stories were a mixed bag of annoying and fun. Unfortunately the fact that the stories each receive only limited attention, and the story changes from one focus to another storyline entirely just as things start to seem interesting, makes this film a bit frayed and taxing to the patience. Nevertheless, the film is about a whole host of young people, dressed up and heading for a party (ostensibly Martha Plimpton's party), but they never quite make it there. Plimpton, someone I never really cared for, is actually rather funny in this role, and in fact hilarious when she misses her own party (and her idol, Elvis Costello). Christina Ricci and Gaby Hoffman are both quite funny; Courtney Love, Paul Rudd and Janeane Garofalo are also quite a trio. Overall this is light comedy; nothing special but still worth the effort. 
 No offence,but I couldn't agree more with most everyone else who's rated this collection.It just isn't right without Sons Of The Desert,Way Out West,The Music Box and Another Fine Mess.For me the best films in this DVD set would be March Of The Wooden Soldiers,Be Big and The Lucky Dog.The latter being a collector's item going by how it was Stan and Ollie's very first film together,even before they became the famous comedy duo.Utopia would be another collector's item,being their very last film from 1950.I hadn't realised they were around that long.However,their appearance in this film is an eyesore,with Stan so thin and sick looking and Ollie three hundred pounds overweight.One thing you may notice,is the film's remarkable simularity to Gilligan's Island 
 It seems Kramer also has his personal agenda. For a more balanced and better evaluation you should turn to Contending Visions of the Middle East : The History and Politics of Orientalism by Zachary Lockman 
 I bought a plain rabbit a couple of years ago, and though i liked it, it did, at times, take a lot of strength to get a cork out.  Then it broke in the sense that it would pull the cork, but not take the cork out of the corkscrew afterward.  So I went shopping for a new rabbit, and read a featured review quoting bad experience (not unlike mine) and recommending the le Creuset "screwpull".  Though it cost more, I did buy the Le Creuset, and love it.  It is way easier to pull any cork than the Rabbit ever was 
 Although there is much practical advice and interesting facts about child development, the overall result is a tired and dated manual. Some of the advice is downright dangerous!  The book explored the conflict between putting infants to sleep on their back as opposed stomach. There is a  clinically accepted link between Babies sleeping on their stomach and SIDS,  Sudden Infant Death Syndrom. There isn't a pediatrition or health nurse on  the planet who would recomend putiing an infant to sleep on their belly, let  alone give an option between the two 
 This is a good book with lots of great information about the incestuous relationship between the Bush family and the Saudi royal family.  The relationship is repugnant, especially in view of the fact that fifteen of the nineteen 9/11/2001 hijackers were Saudi nationals; in light of the apparent White House managed flights that helped some 140 bin Laden and Saudi royals to escape the U.S. only days after the murderous attacks on American soil.     Quite honestly, I wonder why an otherwise intelligent man like Craig Unger would receive and prominently display an endorsement from an extremist-bigot like Michael Moore on the front cover of his book.  Why not include on the cover other luminary Jew-haters and Israel-haters such as Jimmy Carter, Kofi Annan, Cindy Sheehan, John Dingell and Cynthia McKinney?  Unger indicates no personal Jew-hatred or anti-Semitic tendencies in his book.  Why then did he resort to a bigot like Michael Moore for an endorsement 
 I bought this product after pulling numerous items out of the toilet.  The suction cups never really fit securely to the toilet and after I finally thought I had it right, I found the Toilet Lock floating in the toilet like everything else.  
 This is one of the worst written books I've had the displeasure of reading.  I can spare you the misery.  Companies recover from slumping quarters and dissapointing returns by increasing their communication, co-operation and collaboration.  That's the entire book in one sentence.  The hubris that wreaks from this book is denser than the arrogance it oozes on each page.  The text suffers from redundancy to the millionth degree, by the way.  I vote less than one star, however Amazon forces a one star minimum 
 What a disgusting book.  Some 22 year old, who probably has never gone to a college writes a book about this?  What has happened to this country - the mentality of these people.  DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! 
 Schneiderman's "Leonardo's Laptop" is singularly disappointing.  Promising to raise our expectation of what we should get from technology, he instead uses a forced extended metaphor in the form of Leonardo da Vinci.  What would Leonardo do?, we are repeatedly asked.  Schneiderman attempts to answer the question.  Sadly, his answers are neither new nor groundbreaking.  I cannot believe that Leonardo would simply recount solutions that are already available and attempt to make such solutions sound visionary and forward-thinking.  The chapters in the book discuss the issues with usability today, activites and relationships, and attempt to discuss future directions in several fields: government, healthcare, business, and education.  In these chapters, Schneiderman uses feel-good buzzwords like 'empowering' and 'enabling', but never moves beyond the feel-good buzzwords to suggest real solutions.  In most cases, he suggests solutions that are already implemented; in others, he simply waves his hands at the problem and says that there has to be a solution.  Each chapter concludes with a skeptic's corner.  This section could easily be re-labelled the strawman's corner.  In that section, he constructs arguments that skeptics might use, but he must assume that skeptics are uniformly moronic.  The so-called skeptical arguments are drawn with exceptionally rough strokes, which he dispenses of with little regard to very real concerns that can and should be discussed.    I had high hopes for this book.  I wanted something that pushed the boundaries.  I wanted something visionary.  Instead, I got a repetitive book that somehow didn't say anything.  I can only hope that future works give us something better than this.  
 This book did not speak to me at all.    I'm a Polytheist.  The Temple Mount is the site of the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva.  Well, that Temple is gone.  And I think it would indeed be a crime (although not all that big a crime) to knock down the Dome of the Rock and rebuild the Temple to some genuine, sophisticated, and modern Deities.    Well, this book explains how some people want to discover where the First and Second Jewish Temples, which actually predate the Temple of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, stood.   It discusses some religious fanatics who want to rebuild the Jewish Temple.  It talks about Christians and Muslims as well.  I could say that we wouldn't have this problem if we'd just left the Temple to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva alone.  And that this entire issue is Their revenge on us for abandoning Them in favor of the ridiculous monotheist god.  But I won't do that.    Now, I do, of course, think it would be a crime if the Jews simply knocked down the Dome of the Rock and rebuilt their Temple in its place.  But I think there is little risk of that happening soon.  And I think that the claim that such a move would risk a world war is more than a bit of an exaggeration.  Anything could trigger some events that could have serious consequences.  But Gorenberg appears to put way too much importance on the Temple Mount.  Meanwhile, a few religious Jews and some assorted Jewish nationalists are thinking about building a new Temple.  Now, Gorenberg does point out that the religious fanatics are rather crazy.  But he managed to convince me that he's at least as crazy as they are.  First, it ought to be easy to resolve the question of the Dome of the Rock: unless there is a very good reason to remove it, simply leave it there!   And I see no very good reason.  Here, Gorenberg is correct to hope that we can all put our fights behind us and not kill each other over such issues.  But there is one minor problem that still needs to be addressed.    That problem is simple: it will not bring peace to say, "Let's all put the past behind us and quit fighting.  Since we no longer care about the Temple Mount, I'll take it and do what I please with it.  Since nobody cares about it any more, we ought to let me win!"   That will not work.  That is what would happen if we tore down the Dome of the Rock to build a Pagan, Jewish, or Christian Temple.  But is there a chance that we'll have the same problem if we give everything to the Muslims?  I think there is.  And I think Gorenberg fails to admit this at all.    The problem is simple.  Hindus have temples.  The Bahai have a splendid temple, in Haifa.  All sorts of religions have their special sites.  And no matter how silly Gorenberg thinks it is, Judaism is a temple-based religion.  If even a few Jews want to rebuild their temple, I think they'll do it eventually.  If that means tearing down the Dome of the Rock, that will annoy the Muslims.  If it means not building a temple at all, the issue suddenly leaves the world of religion for that of human rights: Muslims have no right to demand that people of some other religion be precluded from having a temple.    I think an obvious possible solution (not the only one) is for the Jews to resolve the issue by building a temple somewhere else, say on Mount Scopus.  But I think Gorenberg is crazier than the fundamentalists if he says that the only reasonable solution is to agree to fundamentalist demands to keep the Jews, but no others, from having a temple at all 
 Thankfully, I was able to browse at this in my public library before buying it. The title doesn't reflect on the actual book. While the illustrations were clear and quiet a few were lovely the book failed to explain how the artists used anatomy and how they determined how to compose their figures. for an anatomy book, this falls horrible short. There about a handful (literally one handfull) of pages with live models. The images are of various sizes and almost on top of each other. More annoyingly for what few live model poses we are given the best are put inbetween two pages. You'll have an annoyign crease righti n the middle of the picture. It's not that hard to fill in the gaps, but certain details are lost from this type of placement.  Also when going into skeletal structures he might have used a real model skeleton instead of sketches. You don't get an adequate understanding of dimension with a pencil depiction alone. Also, most of the book is dedicated to the common characters of comics (e.g. the barabarian, the female robot, Muu the fatman, Brutus the hulk). All these characters really show are sketches at different angles with bullets with brief  common sense info.   Plus the anatomy of most of the characters arenot really explored. It would have been nicer had they compared the exagerated features with realistic features.  Overall , despite some talented artists' contributions, this book fails in teaching anything abotu anatomy 
 This was terrible. I returned after hours with tech support and days of email exchanges with Apple Support Desk.   The product will probably be better with future software updates, but in my experience, it was fairly unreliable in its current state. Examples of problems: wouldn't download drm managed content online, had problems when downloading itunes purchased music (the first time I've had that problem in 4 years of ipods and itunes), couldn't connect to my corporate VPN, and finally, just as evidence of the lack of QA on this device, the included instruction manuals were for the previous version of the Apple Extreme. The images were of the previous white, button-shaped device.  This was a genuine disappointment, and it seemed to stem from bad software and bad QA.  Others seem to have had more success, but I'm back on my 802.11g airport extreme and all problems have magically disappeared 
 The novel of the same name by Joyce Carol Oates on which this movie was based is beautiful, moving, transcendent, heartbreaking, lyrical, and unforgettable.  The movie, on the other hand, felt like the After-School Special version of the book.  Do yourself a favor and read the novel instead.   "Make them regret all they ever did to you and your sisters... 
 The fatalistic view of Conservativism is expressed by Kirk even before the first chapter concludes as he states, "[Edmund] Burke, could he see our century, never would concede that a consumption-society, so near suicide, is the end for which Providence has prepared man".  But wait. The Conservative Mind was first published in 1953, the mythical golden age of America with Ward and June Cleaver and Normal Rockwell. Meanwhile, Burke, a contemporary of the 18th century is pining for the 14th century. What a depressing ideology to think that we always live in the worst of times.  There are certain ideological threads that carry throughout the book including a belief in the stratification of society. Voting should be the privilege of a small minority rather than universal democracy which Kirk saw as contributing to a degradation of society. Kirk writes, "What men really are seeking, or ought to seek, is not the right to govern themselves, but the right to be governed well" but what he offers is a lack of true representation. The author pines for the days of the aristocrat and although he defines the elites by wealth, intellect and lineage he clearly includes race and gender. Is it so surprising that Kirk lauds some of the worst racists in American history like Nathanial Bedford Forrest whom he describes as `magnificent' before quoting his racist vitriol? In a particularly galling move he referrers to pro-slavery advocate John C. Calhoun as a `defender of minorities' and praises John Randolph for, among other things, opposing doctrines of racial equality. Kirk goes on about Calhoun's support for states rights but his support only extended to southern states as he supported the Fugitive Slave Act which forced federal officials and law officials in Northern states to return runaway slave under penalty of $1000 fine. He supported laws that would make it illegal for northerners to even protest slavery. For Calhoun states rights were nothing more than a self serving attempt to keep slavery safe. Kirk shows his own racist stripes when he refers to northern `anti-slavery agitation' and supports Calhoun for choosing racial preservation over liberty, although Calhoun has an extremely warped view of liberty. One wonders if Kirk could even fathom the supreme irony in stating the Calhoun mounted a `strong protest against domination by class or region'.  Another thread is his desire to see the reunification of church and state. The duty of the church is to keep the unclean masses in line. Quoting Samuel Coleridge, the author makes it clear that the truth or falsity of the church is irrelevant; it is an institution that must be preserved as the primary means of social control. Sounding like the inspiration for disgraced Chief Justice Roy Moore, Russell Kirk urges that, "state and church ought never to be separate entities, true religion is not merely an expression of national spirit; it rises far superior to earthly law, being, indeed, the source of all law". Kirk sees a difference between the faulty laws of man and the laws of God but never draws a distinction. I have to wonder if, like the modern Reconstructionist, Kirk wanted to see the laws of Leviticus imposed including executing homosexuals and blasphemers. He never explains how one might recognize a law of God besides using prejudice.  The third thread would be Kirk's anti-intellectual (or perhaps pro-stupid) stance. He refers to human reason as `puny' and `impotent' and claims that we find the mind of God in prejudice and tradition. `Prejudice', he writes, `is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue, and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision, skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved'. Actually what he is advocating is for the general population to turn over rational thought to the church and those higher up the social chain. Citizens are encouraged to exhibit awe and veneration for God and those in higher stations and authority.  In order to grab the golden fleece of populism Conservatives have lately had to abandon overt stratification although veneration of wealth is certainly still evident. Like Calhoun the support for states rights remains a complete faade. I found Russell Kirk's salesmanship of Conservativism generally repellent but recommend the book because it remains a fairly enlightening view of an ideology that continues to thrive to this day. 
 This book is definitely written by someone who knows JSF.  From the author's point of view, the structure and style of this book may have made sense.  From your point of view as a reader, unfortunately, it does not.  The code examples are broken unnaturely and even an experienced developer will find themselves wondering what class this or that code fragment belongs to.  There's no solid narrative that shows you how to accomplish the objective of building a component.  Instead, there is a confounding play-by-play: do this, then this, then this...  Its a memorization challenge.  Complexity is not really an excuse to jettison any attempt to make a book readable.  That is the books main flaw, it takes an admittedly challenging subject (JSF and AJAX integration) and makes it almost impossibly uncohesive and, frankly, dull.  Another disturbing fact is that AJAX plays a remarkably small role in the book.  So much so that it walks the line of simply cashing in on the hype by putting the name on the cover.  Having found these things to be true, I decided if I downloaded the source code and used that as a framework for understanding, the book might be more useful.  I surfed on over to its website only to discover - THERE IS NO SOURCE CODE.  That's just plain scary.  The book graduates from 1 to 2 stars based on the fact that there is a lot of information present, expecially regarding the processing lifecylce.  You won't have much fun parsing it though.  When I saw this book, I thought, "Great!  This is EXACTLY what I'm looking for."  Don't fall into the trap.  The title is exactly what you are looking for, not the book. 
 I personally do a vast amount of reading with lean enterprise being of special interest. Womack has done some great work, but this is a "tough read" even for serious lean enthusiasts. I typically finish a book of this length within 2-3 days then re-read it and highlight. It literally took me 11 weeks because I was lulled to a point in which reading further would be of no benefit and would have to put it back on the shelf and revisit it days later. I realize that scholarly and business writing is not especially exciting as I am constantly reading and doing research but this one was tough even for me, an avid reader 
 I flip through Time every now and again at the barber shop.  Sometimes there are good bits that they are using to keep the interest of people who want progressive social change, people who are sick of the power of the corporate elite and the violence of our militarists.   For the most part, since Time receives most of its revenues from Big Business advertisements, it can't challenge the establishment as it needs to. So instead I read magazines like Z, Utne, Mother Jones, The Progressive, The Sun, Earth Island and the New Internationalist 
          Everyone has heard about that right? Creed was sued by their own fans for playing crappy live shows ahahaha! It would be really difficult to find a rock album that sucks more than this. Seriously, if you ever feel the desire to buy this piece of garbage, please rethink it and buy the albums that these guys are ripping off and pilfering from. Anything by Pearl Jam or other early nineties rock act would be great. Collectively, we can make America a place where talentless losers like Creed don't become stars with their awful music 
 This is the Jurassic Park mentality of dealing with xenophobia. You just treat the Japanese or any other foreigner with the same awe and fear that you first saw (or even read) the CGI dinosaurs in Spielberg's blockbuster.  Crichton's novel is essentially a pot-boiler of a homicide thriller. To make it sound more exotic, he added a Japanese-cum-American rivalry context with any a healthy dose of "yellow fever" and xenophobia thrown in.  Sean Connery "water walks" through his usual role of the umpteenth time of being a master detective with a younger co-star being tagged along. He has seen better days. (Namely, The Name of the Rose and The Untouchables). Frankly speaking, he could have had just played Sherlock Holmes and get it done and over with.   Connery plays a so-called legendary cop who is trained in the way of the Japanese culture. So, he more or less knows a thing or two about the Japanese. Wesley Snipes, acts as a hot-headed "fool" of a co-star who fumbles and tumbles till Connery rescues him in the Highland way.   The fact that the kung fu action scenes are being inserted sparsely throughout the movie shows that the director, Philip Kaufman is using martial arts as an alarm clock to wake any uninterested audience members who dozed off in his convoluted plot.  Tia Carrera in another thankless role that requires her to draw upon her Asian background to act as a foil for both stars. The ending in regards to her is so lame and in fact ambiguous speaks for the rest of the movie. It remains respectful and xenophobic about the Japanese at the same time, that the movie doesn't know who or what it is, and this turns out to be an identity crisis, in terms of plot and direction 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 I was given three months to read this book, and each time I picked it up I threw it down in disgust.  Between the none-stop Johnny Appleseed referances to the Collegian's Guide to Growing Pot, it is amazing I got through it.  I am convinced he was once a Columbian drug lord 
 You almost feel sorry for the author.  Draped in acclaim, among the books of the year, it can only mean that any reader approaches this book with high expectations.  More worrying, the author's information on the back of the book talks mosly about all the prizes he won at Harvard.  And that's what the book feels like, a very well executed assignment.  It's written in a fairly convincing pidgin English, but when it wavers, it breaks the rhythm and the belief.  It also feels entirely formulaic.  It goes through the trials of dehumanisation (murder, rape, sodomy etc) but it never engages the reader's sympathy, just occasional admiration.  There's no doubt that Iweala can write.  I hope he dares to produce something fresh that doesn't feel borrowed from another culture, another life.  I'd risk buying another book of his 
 This is by far the most worthless book I've ever read. It's difficult to call O'Reilly conservative or liberal, since he expresses very little opinion on anything. All he knows how to do is complain and place the blame for America's problems on all kinds of undeserving scapegoats. If you are an O'Reilly fan, God forbid, this book will surely convert you.  My advice? Keep writing, Bill, and I'll certainly have an endless supply of doorstops

 Purchsed this item as a gift for Christmas. The DVd was bad, and would not play. Amazon sent another right away, so customer service was excellent. However, the second one did not play either. This time, Amazon failed to follow up after we notified them of the failure of the second DVD. We still have a DVd that does not work. And after requesting a label to send it back, we have not heard from Amazon since. First time we ever had a bad product, and also the first time amazon has failed to assist us in getting a replacment or refund. 
 A book with a picture collection of ideas, but very dated if not outdated. Many kitchens appear based from the 1960s era. The book almost comes across as a gathering of many old pictures assembled to glean the final dollar profit in book publishing.  Despite what the lead review suggests about "Its sharp photography" - photo reproduction is second rate. For those just starting the thought process and starting with minimal knowledge of kitchen building the book represents a possible starting point, but lacks true substance beyond that point. Those looking to build an upscale kitchen are well advised to look elsewhere; "At Home With America's Top (26) Chefs" is arguably the best of the best, a book with solid ideas and concepts applicable even to the more modest kitchen 
 ... these words will be here to warn you. This book has had millions of reprints. It gets a new title every year just so that all the 1 star reviews vanish over for a new term.  The hoaxer admitted forging the diary.  Okay, say the name on the tip of your tongue - The Diary of Jack the Ripper - and watch as the dollar signs flicker before your eyes. It was bound to happen sooner or later. The reason why the Diary is still popular today is because a few Ripperologists attached their name to it and few have had the guts to actually say that they where wrong and walk away from it. The Diary is essentially a mini-volume of notes allegedly written by James Maybrick, around the time of the Whitechapel murders, that sign at the end as "Jack the Ripper". So how does it read? Well it is reasonably fair to say that it is very creative reading and does keep you entertained, but then again that is exactly what it is meant to do. What we know today is that it is undoubtedly a forgery because the owner of the book Michael Barrett simply admitted to forging it himself. End of story, really. So you might enjoy this book but remember that it is only fiction and the case is still far from solved.  What one must remember is that James Maybrick is still a Ripper suspect and was a Ripper suspect long before the advent of the Ripper Diary so don't discount this suspect just on the bases of this book being a forgery.  Click on the authors name and have a good look around. I am sure you will be impressed and the message will finally sink home. Shame about the Ripperologists who went pair-shaped hooking up with this book as the Real McCoy. There have been a few causalities because of it 
 Two Federal Marshals are dispatched to a remote island housing a mental institution for the criminally insane to look for a missing patient named Solando.  Throw in a Hurricane that traps the Marshalls on the island, a lot of strange behavior, and you have the premise for Shutter Island.  The book does not live up to the expectations Dennis Lehane's readers expect from him (although looking at the other reviews I could be dead wrong about that).  There are glimmers of Lehane's talents, but the book feels like a rushed screen play.  There is action, there is mystery, there are menacing situation, but it is all very glossy and superficial.  The reader will also probably solve the mystery by page 150.  It is not all grim however.  The book does flow nicely, reads easily and the last 25 pages were very powerful emotionally.  I did enjoy the book, but would expect something like this from James Patterson (this would be an achievement for him) but not from a fresh talent like Dennis Lehane 
 Although I'd been to Maui before, this book revealed many new establishments and all we tried were great.   I would recommend this book to anyone traveling to Maui.  It pays for itself after the first meal.   Don't miss Bale French Cafe in the Mall in Lahaina....it was excellent 
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 No, it's certainly not as good as the first one, but I did enjoy some of DEMONS 2. The beginning is cool enough, with the demon's resurrection and it's gaining access into Sally's apartment via the TV set. The tension and dread seem to build quite nicely. That is, right up to the scene where the kid-demon's chest pops open to reveal an idiotic, rubber demon puppet! Ugg! It reminded me of those stupid monsters in GHOULIES, HOBGOBLIN, or some other wretched '80s mess! The apartment building setting was interesting, but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few, precious bursts of action we actually get. I did like the weightlifter folks in the gym. They were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders! The battle in the parking garage was ok too. Maybe I just expected D2 to be a bit more frightening and disturbing...           
 I love the FIRM workouts, and I love the instructor Allie, so I was so excited to try this new workout.  I was unfortunately extremely disappointed.  This workout was not complicated, but it also wasn't much of a workout.  I didn't get my heart rate up at all, and didn't break a sweat.  Some of the moves are just not very good, and having to repeat them everytime we add on got really annoying.  The disco part was my favorite, but overall, this is a workout that I can honestly say I would rather have the money then the workout.  I will keep it and periodically do it on a VERY light day or in addition to another workout, but that's just because I have it.    I've tried a couple other of the new FIRM workouts that are more worth the money...this one I am sad to say is not. 
 When the background music completely overpowers the dialogue, you may as well turn it off.  The background music was piercing and I needed to have the remote in hand to keep adjusting the volume.  Not everyone has perfect hearing and shows with overwhelming background music are becoming the norm.  A shame because otherwise I could have enjoyed Crash 
 This must be one of the latest entries in the Dan Brown school of writing. Name an expert, assign an audience, lecture on historical points and expect applause at the end. Well, Kathy Reichs can wait for a long time. There will be no applause for this book. I would like my money back. I'm almost finished and still can't really figure out what the plot actually is. I guess she will just pop the final lecture and the conclusion will name the murderer. What about motive, character development (sex + history), etc... This is my first novel by this author and it will be my last 
 A compilation of few interesting ideas and very hard to see illustrations. Poor quality reproductions.  No measurements at all.  Furthermore the contact information in the back was not cross-referenced with the designs & listed no phone or web contact, just mailing addresses.  Seems like the authors took the cheap and easy way out with a good idea.    Taunton Press's "The Cabin" is a much more inspiring & informational book.  I do not recommend this book.  
 This book was recommended by a psychiatrist to help me with my poor self image, due in large part to my obesity.  I just don't get it.  The stories did not inspire me at all, and I couldn't even finish the book.  Maybe I'm the wrong audience for this book, because I'm not a feminist per se nor a lesbian

 I've been a Vampire Chronicle lover since I read The Vampire Lestat and have followed closely every single new Vampire Chronicles. I don't usually buy hardcover, but in my eagerness to read, I even bought the hardcover version, as soon as it's release; However, I must say that I'm really disappointed in the two latest chronicles, Blackwood Farm and Blood Canticle.  I am no language professor or writer. I don't read to analyze/dissect the novel or anything like that. I read just for pleasure. I don't care if there's inconsistencies or some other small problems or strangeness in the novel. I only look to be able to share and enjoy the adventures with the heroes; to be drawn into the story. However, I feel alienated from the heroes. They seemed so aloof. There seemed to be no real passion in the story. I don't understand what's missing. I so terribly want to enjoy and like the books 
 John Updike's literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written - every one of his non-fiction collections is worth reading.  But his novels have, from the very first, been precious, over-written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation.  When he writes fiction, he's like a dog doing tricks for reward.  And certainly, the rewards have come.  But for readers outside the US at least, it's all a little mystifying.  John Cheever was a far better writer, yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by Americans as the lesser canon.  Time will correct this mistake, no doubt, but in the meantime Updike pours out ever more cloying and over-heated work like this.  If I still have your attention, let me recommend the 'Collected Stories' of John Cheever.  Updike could only dream of writing prose like that.  
 If this is a brilliant debut then what else  these publishers are looking at must be really abysmal!  The characters are cartoons....the writing is glib and I just kept thinking...who cares?   I am just stunned by the positive reviews and the hype and I loved Secret History by Donna Tartt.  If there were minus stars I'd give it one 
 Well, what can I say? I'm usually not very picky about "seamonster"-movies (especially when there's a shark involved). And though it didn't surprise me, "Red Water" (hm..!), whatever you do don't believe the cover of the dvd. That shark (!) looks frightening, and looks to be a Great White. The shark in this movie however is a Bull Shark, and very "plastic" in a non-Hollywood-sence.   There is plenty of shark in "Red Water", some reviewers here mean that you hardly see the shark, but that's not the problem. The problem is that you see the shark TOO many times, and as mentioned; it's not much to look at! The effects (?) are something between Jaws 3 & 4, and that explains a lot if you are familiar with those. The acting is what you'd expect from a b-movie, ok at its' best, the script is paperthin -but it could've been more "watchable" if "more story, less shark".  I doubt that I will watch "Red Water" again. B-movies like "Anacondas" and "Lake Placid", well, at least the effects are somewhat believable.   I didn't expect much, but got less...  
 There is frankly no 'truth' to be found in this publication.  Aside from the previously circulated speculation regarding Hillary Clinton's political aspirations and orentation, her knowledge of and duplicity inside the Lewinsky affair, and her march to the Senate, this work is void of anything but base conjecture and one-sided analyses which offer no depth and villify the women's movement in 21st century America at large.  I had the double misfortune of perusing this volume via CD.  The material is made far less credible by Mr. Klein's own wheezy and wet-sounding reading of his work.  I address this first because I am part of a large number of technoservants who spend 8-10 hours per day with no diversions during a monotonous coding job but for headphones, and I want explicitly to warn any readers from the audio version of this work.  It begins with an inane and unintentionally ridiculous buzzing sound from somewhere at the top of Klein's palate and carries on with sardonic emphasis placed on repeated terms such as:  'lesbianism', 'leftist' and 'aspiration'.  Spaced at roughly equal intervals (making one further question the very validity of research), Klein gleefully quotes Mr. and Mrs. Clinton, their aides and supporters, and the altogether too-rare addition of Clinton apoligists in making vulgar statements.  A professional narrator understands the proper treatment of the profanity that occurs (and is only attributed to the Clinton camp) in situations such as this, and Klein clearly does not.  Klein's very decision to narrate his own narrative is a poor one, and further displays the partisanship that he clearly wishes to convey with every written word of it.  As to the substance, and contrary to the title, there are no revelations about Mrs. Clinton contained anywhere within this narrative.  And I sincerely mean that - Klein has acheived no investigative credibility in simply regurgitating what is already known about the Senator.  The speculations regarding her sexuality (or, as Klein would argue, her very lack thereof), her role in Mr. Clinton's sexual escapades and the Lewinsky affair, and the politicking that took place in New York are either matters of public record or outright conjecture that would make Kenneth Starr look like a law-and-order hawk.    With reference to what the title leads the casual browser to believe is the centerstone of the book (what she knew about the Lewinsky affair), Klein does nothing but recirculate rumors and ideas that any half-informed person has already heard:  that Hillary knew about Bill's affair with Monica, that she did nothing to stop it, and even that she was reponsible (!!!) for it because it was her connections that lead to Lewinsky's entrance to the White House.  There is a contradictory juxtaposition here - Klein leads the reader on into this affair shortly after explaining that a young Hillary Rodham launched a verbal tirade against harrassment of interns while an intern herself.  Klein mistakenly presumes that everyone will nod at his faulty logic (that Hillary became the enabler of a concept she defames), yet it actually illustrates that Hillary is what she claims to be:  her own woman, independent of Bill himself.  As a disclaimer, I do not support Hillary Clinton.  I believe that she is a disengenuous person, willing to sacrifice her own rather confrontational ideas in favor of pursuit of public office.  But Klein makes this argument foolish.  His barely disguised anymosity for the Democratic party at large and his not-at-all disguised disdain for feminism which borders on outright sexism within this very narrative (he frequently charactarizes Hillary's crowd as a group of butch supporters of what HE has dubbed 'lesbianism') is nothing short of inane.  This narrative is poorly organized, and the silly quips with which he ends each of the far too numerous 'chapters' are representative of, well, nothing at all.  Possibly the saddest commentary I can offer is that this narrative is wrought with inconsitency on both an intellectual and factual level (as Klein altogether too often relies on sources who 'jumped ship' from the Clinton camp and he treats his conjecture as actual evidence, often citing 'facts' that are no more than his own speculation of Hillary's mindset), and has no organization to fall back on except the aforementioned large number of 'chapters'.  This work just rambles on and on while saying, well, nothing.  Finally, readers may chuckle to see that Klein has printed a number of glaring grammatical errors:  at one point he says that Hillary wore contact lenses that make her eyes 'bluer'.  In summation, this work needs to carry the disclaimer:  "Paid for by the Republican National Commitee" in exactly the same way the Michael Moore's "Faranheit:  911" needed a discalimer for the Democratic party.  That way the casual browser or, in my case, the frankly interested citizen preparing to make voting decisions for the 2008 primaries would just keep browsing.  There is nothing in Klein's work that suggests any effort on his part to search for the 'truth' he erroneously claims to offer; only the 'cut-and-paste' [... 
 To the reviewer who wasn't able to see his own image, I recommend turning on the light in the room :o) Pic is fine on my iBook G4 running OX 4, but camera crashes Yahoo msg constantly, even with the 5USD downloaded driver from macally! Manual is useless - only tells you that you can have other people view your image online. Duh! What a shockingly innovative feature for a webcam? :op Next time I will probably spend a little more and get a cam that will work properly with Mac 
 this hippy master of CHEESE made my middle years a living HELL with his horrid M.O.R. sap toons! How can ANYONE actually praise these corntastic AM gold leftovers from an era that had some REAL music  going on? This is like putting AIR SUPPLY over the BEATLES as a GREAT ROCK BAND---wake up America! 
 I'm embarassed that I read this all the way through. The language/expletives passing for literature and dialogue were an early turnoff. I don't live with people who talk like that, and I don't understand the purpose: "sophistication"? To my mind, the characters were not enhanced nor the plot forwarded by the way the book was loaded with @%#&*s.  
 I was certainly bothered by this book though not because of the graphic violence, but by the fact that this is really a christian apology. Under the guise of speaking through a Yanomamo shaman (now deceased), it presents a bleak view of constant suffering of this Amazonian tribe. Then, whites (nabas) bring Jesus to the jungle and everything is becomes wonderful.   While pretending to be an anthropolgy book, it is really an attempt to justify the intrusion of Christian missionaries into the lives of "primitives" all over the globe 
 No one will appreciate this review because I am sixteen and had to read this book for my english class over the summer. The diary entries are kind of interesting, but the analysis just KILLS my desire to read this book. I mean, as far as educational purposes go, couldn't they just put the diary in a book and let the students analyse it themselves? If you're into this kinda book, then disregard this review, but if you're sixteen and assigned this, beware. I probably wont even finish it before school starts 
 I selected the option for 'paperback' and did not have a good experience purchasing an item a few months back with Amazon so I made sure before I purchased the item it still stated paperback.  When I received the item it was a HUGE book.  This was supposed to replace a book for my son's 1st grade teacher that he brings home nightly for homework because we lost it at a restaurant.  Furthermore, the front and back cover was completely torn off from the rest of the book.  
 I thought this book would deal only with the 2nd Iraq war but was mistaken.  About half this book described the history of Iraq.  The actual war coverage was broad and brief.  This book lacks much of the detail of previous Keegan books.  John Keegan has written many superb books in the past but this one was a disappointment 
 For some reason, Amazon keeps deleting my review but here it goes again.  I personally found the book interesting when I first read it (particularly the box theory on triggering stock purchases and sales).  However, when I bought a later copy I found a newspaper clipping from December 1964 which stated that the New York Attorney General had sought and received an injunction against Mr. Vargas from promoting his book because the results he cited were not real.    I don't know how the case ended up because there was only the one clipping, but buyers should be forewarned before buying this book 
 This turner was much too "soft" for my taste; the neck is bendable to the point that it makes it difficult to use.  I have several other Kitchenaid products which I really like, but this one is going to be replaced soon 
 The premise of this book sounds great but it just does not live up to expectations. The majority of the book is comprised of organizational forms that are simplistic and could easily be done yourself with a few minutes on a word procdessor or spreadsheet, and done much more conveniently and with more depth and flexibility on any of the various homeschool organizational software programs that are available. There are a few helpful articles in the book, but they are too few to warrant the price. 
 Another abysmal reprint of mind numbing market lore from days gone by. Not worth the time to open. Read Gustave le Bon and learn something useful. Line the birdcage with this 
 How could Carpenter, who created an unduplicated masterpiece with the original "Halloween" have been part of the writing team for this? The premise was respectable enough, the day after where the original left off with Jamie Lee Curtis in the hospital, Donald Pleasance on the hunt for the maniacal killer Michael Myers, who at the end of the original left the audience hanging when he disappeared after being shot several times and falling out a second story window. A strong place to begin a sequel. But what they do with that premise from that point on is no more than what every "Priday the 13th" type slasher flick did throughout the 80s, and then some. While the original used suspense, masterful direction and camera work, the sequel cheated with the camera and exploited its use to take the kills to the next gory level rather than rely on on storyline alone for it's terrifying effects. It also began "Jason-ifying" Michael Myers into the indestrucable beyond belief killer for the sake of leaving the audience hanging, rather than the more plausible premise the original relied on. Add to that the part III of the Halloween Series that many awaited to rectify the sequel had absolutely nothing to do with the first 2 and the viewers of the original had every right to feel betrayed and lost their patience. Who could fault them if they didn't care when "Halloween Ressurection" came out to relatively decent reviews. By then who cared. They'd lost their original audience and deservedly so. I suppose Jamie Lee alone is worth the price of admission to anything, particularly in her "scream queen" hey day. Heck, I even sat through the abysmal "Terror Train" due to her credibility, and of course her comeliness. But Pleasance character goes way beyond the 3 point line in order to score horror film points. The ending of this sequel is unworthy of Carpenter written material, and I'm ashamed for his association with it. I remember looking so forward to this movie, and when we left the theater we were so disappointed in so many ways. This movie was indeed the beginning of the end. Not just for the Halloween saga, but for adding a credible brandname to the likes of "Friday the 13th" type story lines that never had any plausibility to start with ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre" would later be guilty of the same.)  What a wasted opportunity 
 This movie is typical Hollywood anti-war, anti-military, anti-American trash.  The "show biz" liberals, aided and abetted by their ideological cousins, the left-wing TV news moguls, have always sought to portray American soldiers in Viet Nam as baby-killing, drug-crazed monsters.  This movie is typical of that ilk. If you want a more balanced view of the men who fought in that terrible war, buy the DVD of "We Were Soldiers."--a much better, and far more honest, film 
 I am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been USmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday, March 28 
 If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader 
    This book was not at all helpful for new fashion illustrators. I would consider my drawing skills above average.  I mainly do technical designs and decided that I wanted try fashion design for my portfolio.  So I borrowed this book and another book from the library and was very dissapointed.  The cover drew me in, but the pages were not instructional.  The book goes through the traditional 9 heads figure and the help pretty much stops there.  This book is bombarded with really abstract drawings and HINTS on ideas for fashion designs. What a waste!  I'm glad that I borrowed it first!!    The other book I checked out was a book by Bina Abling "Fashion Sketchbook" from the 1980's and that was far more helpful because it gave step by step instructions and illustrations.  It went beyond poses and into garment designs and it was about 20 years old!!  The current edition is kinda pricey but I'm going to invest in it.  Anyway, if you want to learn real fashion illustration I would NOT invest in this book.  
 I have been searching reviews of the Nikon coolpix s7c to make sure that it wasnt just me - and I am finding that indeed countless other reviewers are having the same problem, and many have taken it up with Nikon only to be told 'sorry'.  In a nutshell, I am a professional photographer and have owned about a dozen digital cameras ranging from the early elph to nice new SLR models.  I purchased the Nikon coolpix s7c for my wife, and it is by far the worst one I have owned for many reasons, but the chief problem is they have simply screwed up the way this camera does things automatically and the result is HORRIBLE PICTURES.   The 'electronic VR' is simply digital image sharpening, the ISO adjustments in low light are terrible, and what I simply cannot believe is how terrible the autofocus is.  Couple that with the design of this camera that makes it difficult to shoot steadily, and you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures 
 I have often been exasperated with Henry James and his determination to make a simple sentence into a complicated puzzle and an intellectual game. But I have never been disappointed by James until now. I was surprised to see that this was written within 3 yrs of one of his masterpieces, Portrait of a Lady. If I didn't know better I'd say he wrote this one on a deadline for purely financial purposes 
 I have used this book as a reference tool for a few years now.  When I take my finished product to an agent, he laughs at me and asked where I learned to write.  When I told him that I used Sceenplay: The Foundations of Screenwriting by Syd Field, he laughed at me even harder.  He bascally told me that I had the BASIC concepts down, but if I wanted to follow a "good" writer he introduced me to The Screenwriter's Bible by David Trottier.    This came from the William Morris Agency, so I knew I couldn't go wrong.  He liked the story and decided to represent me if I offered him a better product.  I went home a little discouraged.  I came online to Amazon and purchased the book.  After I read it and looked over my screenplay, I saw where I made the mistakes.    Now, I have sold a few movies/treatments and have another project being looked at by another Hollywood staple.  All thanks to Mr. Trottier.  In other words, pay out a few extra dollars to get the Screenwriters Bible and do it the "right" way 
 If you want a greatest hits package from Reba McEntire, get her first or her second one.  This one contains mostly pop tripe from when she all but abandoned country music to "do what sells".  This collection is phony...just like the lady herself.  
 Call me a Jane Austen Purist but i hated this movie, I did. I tried to bring myself to like it, but I feel as if the A&E version was more closer to the time, the era, the clothing, the language, the seting, etc. And then the constant childish giggling, this is not the Lizzie I know. The more I watched of the film the more I saw characters being destroyed. For example, Mr. Bennett was just not believable to me and Mr. Colins was poorly cast. I just didn't like this film, even I did think that Mcfayden did a good job in presenting darcy but I don't know, this film just did not do it for me. I feel as if Jane AUsten would be rolling in her grave if she saw this version. I do. I dont know how else to describe my disapointment..... 
 Look at the price of this magazine! Over $30 for 6 magazines! I once read one of these magazines at the library and I hated it! There were NO articles about celebrities, Tv, Music, or Beauty. There were some good advice questions in this, but it didn't give any advice for them! It said, "Find the answers to these questions in the next issue of New Moon." Also, in the mail bag, someone wrote, "Why didn't you put Martin luther King day on your calendar?" They wrote back, "sorry, this magazine is ONLY about girls and women." This magazine is really anti-male and disses girls that act like normal teenagers. If you want to get a good magazine, try Girls Life for almost half the price that New Moon is 
  This book has all the elements of a bad novel.  First:  No one apparently proof read this book before it was published.   It's full of spelling and grammar mistakes, the main character's name changes several times etc...   Second:  It is excruciatingly redundant.  There's this blue fog.  It's blue on the first page.   It's blue on the last page. It's blue on every page in the middle.   Wiccan's are good, satanists are bad.  On every page.   Don't worry if you don't get it the first fifty times, it will be explained over and over to you.  Third: There's nothing really sexy about it.  It's not enough to tell readers that something is seductive... show them!  In short, the novel is an insult to the intelligence (and literacy skills) of readers.   
 I have read many of Koontz's books and I have got to say that this is the worst one that I've read to date.  For those that have yet to sink their teeth into some of Koontz's better work, I would suggest Mr. Murder or Intensity.  Leave this one on the shelf to collect dust.  Or better yet, throw it in the trash with the rest of the garbage.  
 With 566 previous reviews (perhaps 565 more than the book merits), it might seem that there was little more to say. However, extremely few of the 566 reviewers have any expertise in biochemistry, a subject that Michael Behe mentions not only in the title but also throughout the book. He argues that his conclusions follow necessarily from the study of biochemistry, and he implies (without going so far as to perpetrate an outright lie by saying so in so many words) that anyone with a knowledge of biochemistry will agree. This is so far from the reality that even his own academic colleagues at Lehigh University find it necessary to post a warning on the departmental web site stating that his views are his alone. Far from what Behe pretends, nearly all biochemists consider that the studies of protein and gene sequences of the past 35 years have constituted one of the triumphs of the Darwinian view of evolution, providing a huge new body of data in support of natural selection. This does not make them right, of course: truth in science is not decided democratically, and overwhelmingly preponderant opinions sometimes turn out to be wrong.  Nonetheless, anyone adopting a minority position has two obligations: to acknowledge that it is, in fact, a minority position, and to offer very strong arguments that have some chance of convincing the majority. Behe doesn't bother with either of these. As he is writing primarily for non-biochemist readers he allows these readers to imagine that there is no significant opposition to his views, and as he has never tried to make his case before an audience of his peers he has not tried to deal with this opposition. Worse than that, he is content to attack Darwinian evolution without bothering to offer any kind of falsifiable hypothesis to replace it.  Perhaps the most serious fault in the book is the confusion that pervades it between studies of the origin of life and studies of evolution. Although Charles Darwin did have some suggestions to make about the origin of life it is not that that he is famous for: his reputation lies in the theory of natural selection, which is not concerned with the origin of life but with its subsequent evolution. It is perfectly possible to think that there remain serious difficulties in understanding how the first organisms came to exist but at the same time that natural selection offers an almost complete explanation of evolution. Indeed, that would be the position of most biologists: hardly anyone considers that the origin of life is well understood. In the book, however, the ideas of irreducible complexity are presented as if they were an argument against natural selection, when they are nothing of the kind. Insofar as they are worth bothering with at all, they draw attention to some of the points that a theory of the origin of life will need to explain.  In relation to the questions that most exercise creationists -- the degree of relationship between humans and apes -- irreducible complexity has no relevance whatsoever. All of the examples that Behe gives, such as blood clotting, operate exactly the same in chimpanzees and humans, and have precisely nothing to say about whether or when chimpanzees and humans had a common ancestor. The biochemical evidence actually goes in the opposite direction from what creationists would like: 40 years ago virtually all palaeontologists thought that the separation between humans and African apes occurred about 30 million years ago, but now almost everyone agrees that it was very much more recent, and it is precisely the mountain of biochemical data that has brought about the change. In fact Behe tells us that he finds the idea of "common descent (that all organisms have a common ancestor) fairly convincing" -- a sentence that seems to have escaped the attention of creationist readers anxious to find a real scientist saying things they think are in support of their views.  With all this, why give the book two stars? The first is because one star is the least that Amazon allows, and the second is because although this book is dangerous and seriously misleading for non-specialists, it is also one that scientists, especially biochemists and molecular biologists, probably do need to make the effort to read, if only to know at first hand what the "scientific" case against evolution consists of 
 Unless you have a new softball glove to break in, this product is not for you. Way, way too much oil.  Just nappy. I might as well have put mayo in my hair. 
 Wow, I was expecting a fun, light read, and in the first chapter already had to skim over a couple of paragraphs relating to "mishaps" that happen to animals in Zippy's life. Well, I thought, next chapter will be better. NOT. The next chapter included a graphic scene of chickens being slaughtered by shovels! Every chapter so far has had something very disturbing about animals in it! If you are sensitive to these things, I would not recommend the book. I'm not sure I'm going to finish it at this rate. Granted, I AM super-sensitive to any animal suffering, but this is really overload. I'm halfway through and so far this is the list: The aforementioned chicken slaughter, a neighbor stealing her cat and starving it in the basement, another neighbor looking to poison her cat, dog-sitting for friends and losing the dog and not worrying about it that much and finding him dead days later, her father going out with a shotgun to kill the dogs who massacred Zippy's pet chicken, joking about a neighbor enjoying "puppy stew", keeping her two dogs penned up, torturing a raccoon by holding in front of 30 braying hounds.... I mean, does that seem like a lot to you??? For a light-hearted "tender" memoir???? Jeez louise! I can't sleep at night from this book 
 I'm not feeling this soundtrack. It's everything that I hate about modern music: all style and no substance, too many heavy beats and not enough melody, too much pop and not enough genuine soul. I could go on and on. I wouldn't waste my money on this. Nothing memorable here 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 This is one of the weaker of Johansen's books. First, her usual delightful secondary characters are absent. And secondly, the primary couple get all the attention, but are formulaic and don't really deserve it.   There is a pattern I think the author should see a shrink about, since it occurs in so many of her books: I've read at least 4, and it's been present in all. In each one, an innocent maiden meets a jaded man-of-the-world, and the only courtship between them is in the form of repellent foreplay: he constantly makes raunchy statements to her in the form of explicit sexual threats, and continues the threats by intimidation and groping. This makes the innocent girl 1) run for cover? or 2) pant and flutter and hop into his bed. (Guess what -- it's #2.) Other than indicating Johansen had serious boundary violations as a teenager, it makes for near-offensive reading--it's sexual harrassment, not romance.  This was actually appropriate to the first Wind Dancer book, as the character had rough edges and his arc in the book was to learn the error of his ways. I love that her 'heroes' are not perfect, not the typical monochromatic virtuous type, but this pattern is just not appropriate for every single couple in every single book.  Johansen is very good at intricate plots, but whatever genre she chooses to write, she should streamline the plot a bit, and give some more focus to character and dialogue. She's very talented, so I always find her books interesting in some way, but the romance aspects of them have been disappointing. 
 I love Anita Shreve's books but this one is not worth the time. It's very disappointing given what she is capable of. The so-called revelation at the end is predictable and the characters are not rich. Give this one a pass 
 Send is nothing but a commonplace guide on email that the marketing gurus had the audacity to compare to the "Elements of Style."  Each chapter is filled with obvious information on email: for example, "The Seven Big Reasons to Love Email" and "The Eight Reasons You May not Want to Email" are basic, skillfully written blogs of what we already know.  Another chapter dedicates 24 pages to the difference between "To" and "CC": again, more information that we know.  The most mind boggling chapter is titled, "How to Write [the Perfect] Email": a title that is undeniably deceitful.  This fruitless chapter uses the poor writing style of a preteen as an example. To add insult to injury, the quick overviews on why to incorporate grammar and punctuation, as well as avoid capital letters and odd fonts is so 90s.  Reviewing this book any further is a waste of valuable time and effort.  Congratulations Messrs. Shipley and Schwalbe for formatting a simple editorial into a $19.95 book. 
 Aslam's core story is fascinating - a culture clash that leads to the deaths of three people, and the collapse of a family. However, I found the book difficult to read for two reasons. The first was the visceral hatred thrown up on nearly every page towards Islam and the beliefs and attitudes held by first-generation Pakistani immigrants. Some of these beliefs are indefensible (such as honour killings and the fatal exorcism that appears in a subplot) but Aslam's seeming hatred of this culture - one he grew up in; he's the son of a Pakistani political exile - and Islam poisons any argument he was trying to make and makes this book a piece of anti-Islam and anti-Pakistani propaganda. The second difficulty with this book comes from Aslam's incredibly pretentious prose style (such as describing segments of an orange on a plate as "dolphins leaping over ocean waves"). Linked in with this is his failed stab at introducing magical realism (men with glowing hands and blood, peacocks and parakeets, fireflies becoming ghosts, men with golden hair), into the mix. The story that Aslam is trying to tell is the only reason why I have given this book two stars. If that hadn't been interesting, it would have just managed one. The difficulties Pakistani immigrants are facing in the UK, and elsewhere in the world, is a matter that deserves investigating and exploring in literature. But there are much better novels that explore these problems - Brick Lane by Monica Ali and Hanif Kureishi's excellent Buddha of Suburbia 
 I received this book as a gift, and found it unreadable. For example, EFS says cost/benefit analysis "is a procedure by which the higher is reduced to the level of the lower and the priceless is given a price". This is meaningless rhetoric to me. It also assumes that only economics provides a guide to human behavior. Or that all economic analysis is totally rational. Schumacher questioned every assumption of "economic science" using theories from the anarchist tradition. Schumacher claimed neocolonialism is the result of politics, not economic principles. But doesn't class and sectional interests drive politics? His advocacy of a search for inward spiritual space, and a rejection of the real world of politics and economics, makes this book part of the problem and not part of the solution.  The 'Introduction' says Gandhi wanted to use "labor-intensive manufacture and handicrafts" (p.5). Milovan Djilas said it was important for newly liberated countries to use mass production ("The New Class"). The historical record over the past centuries should tell you who was right or wrong. Liberating revolutions result in more production and other benefits for the people; else they're not liberating. Unlimited economic growth overlooks the availability of basic resources and the capacity of the environment. But there's always some natural problem that causes a correction.  This is a very verbose book whose arguments rest on unquestioned assumptions. Since it was published in 1973 Thatcher's regime destroyed Britain's coal industry to make them dependent on imported oil and gas. We've seen what happened after they divided and privatized the railroads. But who benefited from these political decisions?   Part II Chapter 3 notes that western Europe "deliberately destroyed nearly half of their coal industries". But the economy in neocolonialist countries will always suffer to benefit the imperialist ruling country. American was a net petroleum exporter until 1967, and influenced Saudi Arabia and Iran (just like Great Britain did previously). You can also consider the actions of Jimmy Carter against nuclear reactors. France and Japan use nuclear power, they have no oil. Saudi Arabia uses nuclear power so they can profitably sell their oil abroad. Those who criticized this book showed good judgment and wisdom. You can read this book and judge its worth for yourself. 
 My mom bought this particular portable player for my son because we were going to be on some long flights and she thought he'd handle it better if he could watch a few dvds.  The picture and audio quality aren't that great, but not bad for the price.  The only problem is that we can NOT get the rechargeable battery to charge.  Therefore, it is useless for the purpose it was bought for.  It still places if plugged into an electrical outlet, but there is no way to take it on the plane.  I have not been able to find a replacement battery, but am assuming it might be less expensive to buy a whole new dvd player 
 This is a cute book and it will hold most of the memories for my child, however, when I purchased this book I had assumed it would be 8 1/2 by 11 (big enough to hold any papers I would also like to keep with it like her birth certificate) however it is not. Only after I recieved the book did I realize that there is a deminsion area and that it will not hold any 8 1/2 X 11 papers. Buyer beware, if you want to purchase a baby record book to also hold other (keepsake) papers that you might want to add then this is not the book for you 
 Beyond Duality was a very disappointing book for me, primarily because to me it seemed that the title itself was very misleading.  I should have looked more closely at the cover photo, which expressed the actual content  of the book far more eloquently, more closely.  It depicts a fairly  disenchanted looking woman and man on the cover, each eyeing the other with  apparent non-comphrehension. Which is exactly what this book is about -  rather than going *beyond* duality,it seems to embrace it.  It is my  understanding that to truly evolve we need to confront and transcend  concepts as male, female, top, bottom, and instead realize that there are  simply people with different traits, needs, and personalities.  This book  is too quick to fall back into excuses and cliches that sound more like  metaphysical rhetoric for "it's a _______thing." The other  exercises fall more into a just too obvious kind of catagory.  Of course  stairways go both up and down, and neither is better than the other (an  actual example from the book.) I didn't find this insightful or useful. I  suppose my disappointment in Beyond Duality stems from the fact that I  expected transcendent, groundbreaking metaphysical ideas, and I got pop  psychology of the "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"  variety, and that was just the kind of outdated thinking I was trying to  avoid.  I prefer not  to give negative reviews, but I also believe that  people should have the opportunity to go into a book with a better  knowledge of what they're getting.  I hope this helps someone 
 While this book had some good ideas, I thought his advise to men to sleep around after a break up was very irresponsible. He admits that many men will be prone to use sex at this time in an addictive way, to numb their feelings, so why encourage them to do so? Even worse, what about the feelings of the women that these men will be USING for their "healing" sex?? nobody deserves to be used that way 
 This is another book by Borg that I would never purchase on my own.  Borg is a proud member of the Jesus Movement and it appears that their main goal is to discredit the Jesus of the Bible and remake Him in the mold of one of many spiritual people throughout history 
 I'm a Grisham fan but this one caught me snoozing. The story was predictable. The characters were ones I feel like are in my hometown which made it quite sad. I kept waiting for it to get better...and it didn't. I skipped entire sections (the ones with the radio broadcast) because I was so horribly bored. I read ahead and didn't feel like I missed a thing! Ah, jocks turn into typical people. Jocks mess with girl...jocks lose girl...old-jocks don't get girl. It's all be done before...in my hometown.  I know that authors need to veer away from their typical genres; Grisham did it wonderfully with Skipping Christmas. Unfortunately, this one just wasn't reflective of his abilities to draw in the reader. I stick with his courtroom thrillers. Those take my breath away 
 I just bought this from Amazon and have had it a day.  Everything seemed great, it sounded great with all my sources, and it even looked good doing it.  Then I tried to play a CD on my second room "B" speakers.  What?  Where's the sound.  Everything is hooked up correctly.   Sounds comes out of the A speakers for the CD.  Sound comes out of both when I have the FM Tuner playing.  What gives?  I finally go back to the manual and after much searching see that, by design, the "B" speakers will only play analog sources and my CD is connected digitally.  How stupid is that?  People with digital connections aren't supposed to have secondary sets of speakers?  Back it goes, I suppose 
 I have heard that this is a children's book (and perhaps there are abridged versions), but I have no idea how a middle schooler could read this dense, verbose novel and understand the subtle, underlying themes Swift portrays. I have heard many positive reviews concerning this book, and although there are many insightful points, perhaps the material was not presented in a interesting fashion, for very often I got lost in the words and nonending references to English politics. On the other hand, it's important to note that in the early 18th century, English satire was probably extremely dry (very different from today, huh :) ) and hard to follow. All in all, this book is an exploration into man's true nature and, despite the sometimes clumsy manipulation of langauge, expresses a mature intellect that reflects Swift's intelligence. 
 i feel that this program uses vocabulary that should not be introduced to children as primary words when beginning a foreign language. it talks of ghosts, witches and other "scarey" things. i just don't feel that  those words are constructive, but that other positive more essential topics  could have been chosen to sing and learn about 
 Given that this poorly designed book consists of pages out of sequence, none of which are numbered, and no in-depth subject review material at all, I cannot recommend this book to anyone preparing for the CLEP U.S. History exam 
 was worthless...was not the correct match for my class book requirement.  Never used it...if someone wants it you can have it for free   
 I downloaded this program and it was garbled and video as if played in slow motion.  This is the first of two downloads that didn't play.  I know it was not my computer because I did download three that played ok 
 It seems that the author is preaching to the engineering choir because it is written for people who seem to already know the subject.  Furthermore, it seems that the author has a sick desire to tell everyone how smart he is by taking a simple subject and making it as hard as possible. There is no intention of teaching the subject and its only purpose is to tell you that it exists.  With the exception of a few good tables/examples, much of the writing and diagrams are crammed in an endless, sloppy soup of paragraphs and over inflated jargon.  Concepts are NOT taught in a structured, simplistic, thorough, or systematic approach, so using this book as a quick reference would be difficult as well.  Problem examples are few and are buried within the text.  I did NOT find any humor in the pages but did find the material to be as exciting as watching paint dry.  Concept instruction, which seems simple at first, quickly degenerates to the point that the rest of the chapter no longer makes any sense.  Freshman students in Computer Science, who are forced to use this book by their university, will find it difficult to comprehend to the point of becoming discouraged and thinking this major is not for them.  I highly recommend finding a supplement to this book and purchasing a used copy if its use is mandatory 
 Well, if anything this was a decently written story, with good dialect and character detail. However, this story felt like it was going around in circles without any indication of ever ending. Grafton seems to have an idea of where she wants to go with this story but never really gets there.    The story starts off with PI Kinsey Milhone in her office at night when she hears a knock on her door. She opens it to find Janice Kepler, mother of Lorna Kepler standing before her with the tale of her daughter's mysterious death. Not only this, but she also explains to Kinsey about how no one ever solved the murder because Lorna's body was left to decompose for ten months in her isolated cabin house. They talk for a while about the strange circumstances surrounding her daughter's death until Janice tells Kinsey about a pornographic video that was sent to her house after Lorna's death. This tape leads Kinsey on a wild goose chase of suspects in the red light district and gets her nowhere when it comes to turning over the real murderer.   	Millhone dives even further and searches through the world of Lorna's day job where she uncovers a mysterious lead about an expensive, elaborate project which is angering several people a considerable amount. Kinsey also checks up on Lorna's family members, and with the exception of Janice, all seem to have a motive to murder her Lorna.  	 Not being a fan of these types of novels, I decided to at least give it a chance but this story got me nowhere. By the middle of the novel I wanted to give up and skip to the end of the story, but when I got to the end I had to go back to the middle to figure out how everything ended. I stopped caring about the whole murder after so much more emphasis was placed on so much side stories and it seemed like Grafton did too. The ending left me with a strange feeling and I didn't know if the book had actually ended. All in all, it was just not the right kind of book for me but if you're a murder mystery fan, try any other of Grafton's alphabet themed novels besides this one 
 I cannot believe this book was actually published.  This is THE MOST racist (if not entirely xenophobic) book I have EVER had the misfortune to read.  I am so thankful that I myself didn't buy this book (it was bought as a present, and has since been swiftly returned to the store, good riddance) and therefore give money to this revolting, despicable American woman who obviously has serious issues with her British husband - of whom has probably divorced her since she wrote the book.  Or maybe whom divorced her prior to her writing, hence why it is so morbidly bitter about the British.  The book compares Americans in the 21st century with a view of the British in the 1950's.  An entirely unfare account of the UK and all whom live in it.  Brash, defamatory lies are spewn across the pages depicting Brits to be living in a repressed, behind-the-times, ugly nation of second-bests and losers.  However, Americans are shown to be the most amazing creations in existence (how surprising that an American should have the utter audacity to believe such propaganda) with every page explaining their "magnificence" and how they are FAR superior to the British.    When there ARE the very occasional compliments to the British way of life, these are then very quickly slapped around the face with a scandalous, condescending dig, and then noted how America is an APPARENTLY far more exceptional country...   I cannot believe I actually wasted a few hours of my life reading this book.  Please, for the sake of your time, money and humanity, do not buy or bother to read this book. I really think this print should be discontinued and a full apology written by the author to all readers on how misguided she was on both the supposedly backwards Brits and godsent Americans who can do no wrong....   I would give this book 0 stars out of 5 if I could 
 I was disappointed with this book. It presents general overview of linguistics and language development that one can find in multiple other sources. There is no practical advise on raising children bilingually. Case studies illustrating possible scenarios are for the most part inapplicable and lack detail to be useful in practice. There are very few books that should go straight into recycling bin - and this is one of them.  
 Excellent book on the life of Benjamin Franklin.  He certainly was a genius and full of surprizes 
 The way Brady made this guide is unacceptable! I found better information on the internet than this stupid piece of crap guide. Whoever the author was on this guide, they should be fired! They also made a crappy MK: Deception guide too. 2 bad strategy guides are totally unacceptable for a company that has had a good reputation in the past. I will never buy another Brady Guide again until they straighten up their act and be more accurate with their guides like they used to be. 
 This is a book that loses your intersted about 1/3 of the way through because the conclusions don't follow from the premises.  An example is that the author states that war has always caused economic conditions to worsen.  But he compares prewar conditions to post war, rather than comparing projected post-war conditions to those that would have been had there been no war.  None of us likes war, and delving into why humans always wind up fighting them would be interesting, but this book doesn't really go there 
 I am a big fan of Peters.  This book is not Peters at his best.  Actually, this can only be called a book because it has a front and back cover and pages in between.  The whole thing is just a lot of short, often unrelated  snippets of information, with a lot of curse-words included to give it some  spice.  You need a road map to keep up with all the acronyms he uses. Did  Tom Peters actually write this book 
 If you're thinking of buying this book in preparation for comedy improv classes, you're off track.  You'll learn in the first weeks of your class that you discover what your scene's about as it unfolds, not a second before.  That's what's funny about comedy improv, watching players discover in the moment what the scene's about.  And the game is usually something little, something accidental, like everyone's wearing too much jewelry on the job.   That's it.  You and your partner figure out as you go what the game is in the scene based on the information you uncover, step by step.  I keep cringing when I think about kids buying this book because instead of learning to explore character, activity, emotion, dialogue and stage picture as a way to build a throughline from scratch, they're being handed pre-packaged "plots" which burden the player with required attitudes and, saps the life and comedy right out of everything.  The only way these scenarios may work is if you teach the kids to take the opposite point of view to what's expected. "It's 3AM and you were expected home from your prom three hours ago.  That's my boy! 
 I wish I could give this zero stars.  Save your money and go get a spiral notebook at your local drug store, it would be just as useful.  I love the show Good Eats and had great expectations about anything with Alton's name on it.  I guess I should have read the reviews first. I am sending it back tomorrow for a refund 
 I must confess I have never read Nora Roberts in my life, so I hate to judge her by just one book.  My mother read this, and kept telling me about it while she was reading it, and couldn't wait for me to read it.  Not being a fan of romance novels, I just totally skipped the blossoming romance between Stella and Logan, because it just seemed typical "romance" stuff.  The rest of the novel just never went anywhere for me.  I never really developed a love for the characters, and the description of Memphis never made me feel that I was there.  Come on - mentioning Graceland and the Peabody - were they supposed to be the token landmarks that make a reader say "o.k. I'm in Memphis".  The author could have just as easily had them visit the Sears Tower and Field Museum, and "poof" they're in Chicago! The ghost aspect had so much potential that never went anywhere either.  I'm a big fan of historical fiction, and if the author had delved into the research the characters did to discover who the ghost was, maybe even adding a few flashbacks of the period when Amelia lived, that would have helped.  The prologue introducing Amelia just didn't flesh her out enough for the reader to invest much in her.  I know that Nora Roberts is a best-selling author, but after reading this, I'm wondering who reads all those books, and keeps buying more?  I have NO interest in getting the next two books in this trilogy.  Haven't had the heart to tell my Mom how much I didn't enjoy it though.  Sorry, I just didn't care for it at all.  It seemed a little amateurish even.  cj 
 I bought this book expecting to share some fascinating stories and experiences, instead each chapter began a buildup and then suddenly you were left standing there alone wondering what happened where did the story go. Very aggravating, then oh yes, this is by the way, where we were, toodle oo on the next tale, or a portion of it anyway 
 I don't like it because it is old fashioned.  It has no violence, scary scenes, or bad language.  Don't get me wrong, I don't like any of those things in excess.    This disk would be good for a two year old who wants to see all of the good old villians like Kingpin, Rhino, Dr. Magnetto, and more.   
 Total rubbish. Wood was scratched on top, corner was smashed, water damage on the shelf, and door was cracked. It is really irritating to spend an hour putting this tv stand together only to find it is too thrashed to use. The holes were not even lined up properly with the dowels making it quite difficult to put together. Extremely shoddy craftsmanship and apparently no quality control. To add salt in the wound, the crumbly styrafoam packaging got all over the living room and I had to spend a good bit of time vacuuming and sweeping so the dog and the baby would not eat it. If you like taking chances and do still want to buy it, it's probably a 50-50 chance that it will be damaged. 
 I bought this book because I thought that I would be able to see everything in the exhibition in detail, and more, as is usually the case with most catalogs from museum shows. Well, this was not the case at all! There was so little in this book, that I decided to return it because it was such a disappointment. The book shows three views of the same few dresses, one view per page, and a tiny bit of the jewelry, with many big blank pages spread out in between, as if they had to get this done in a hurry and had to fill up a certain amount of pages by press time, so it would look like it was "designed". It didn't show anywhere near the scope of what Chanel did, either a long time ago or the more recent things done by Lagerfeld 
 For obvious reasons this book should be easy to read. Unfortunately it isn't, especially not if you're not English (and due to the theme of the book, at least one of two readers could be expected to be non English). The book is full of incredibly long sentences and woolly language and the constant use of terms like 'minority language' and 'majority language' is very confusing.  So far for the style. Now the content. Contrary to the subtitle it's not practical at all. One parent should speak one language, the other should speak the other, both should be consistent - that's the message that is repeated over and over again, and it's about the only practical advice you'll find here. The rest is a heap of possible situations without really valuable tips. Most of the comments from bilingual parents you'll read in this book seem out of context and are therefore not useful. Why a 2 stars rating and not 1? The book was written with honest intentions and I think the authors did their best. But, Mr. Publisher, where was your editor?  
 May be as damaging as out and out lies.  I think Crichton is a fine writer who could have written a great novel about the manipulation of a populace through media and other networks.  Instead we have a hodge podge story that jumps around the Earth as the theses it posits jump around the truth.  One of these that I found most disturbing was the Antagonists statement that DDT was not proven to be harmful.  Maybe so, but the chemical reaction (something that happens quite often in nature) DDT has with some soils leads to DDE which is very harmful to native species.    It reminds me of Bowling for Columbine.  Whether you like Micheal Moore or not, he had a thesis about how afraid Americans are made to feel.  Why do you lock your door at night?  If someone wants to get in, they will.  Moore touches on, but does not get in depth with the pervasiveness of fear in American society.    Crichton does the same while attempting to discredit many environmental groups. He portrays these organizations very well, however, the story never really develops into an in depth investigation of what really terrorizes our society and why that fear drives us to consume, ultimately leading to our very real fear of a society that is one of the safest in the world. (check the FBI website to see how crimes have fallen and show that really we are safer than we were 40 years ago!).       
 Not very well written. Its is simplistic & somewhat condescending. Later chapters tend to repeat basic concepts covered earlier without expanding upon the issues. There are more knowlegable authors out there that are refreshing and can effectively advance the your knowledge 
 I guess you get what you pay for but I thought it would be a bit nicer than it was, very cheap looking. Not well mad 
 the description says it has the pratchett story in it, but it doesn't. it only has 4 of the original 11. what a rip-off! 
 I am sorry to have to say these things but I feel it necessary to be honest. I am a avid reader and I picked this book up to try this author. This book was very slow and the characters  are very shallow.I felt no attachment or pull to any of them. I kept waiting for something to happen but to my dissapointment it never came. You as a reader can tell from the first few chapters exactly what will take place in this book. There was nothing in this book of interest to me as a reader and I will think twice next time before reading anything from this author 
     Dershowitz' book is not so much a book about terrorism as it is specifically an attack on Palestinian terrorism and how terrorism relates to the US and our 51st state, Israel.  The author operates from the thesis of why terrorism is effective, and then proceeds to systematically discount every terrorist campaign in the world, leaving only the Israel - Palestine conflict and 9-11 for discussion.  One would expect to find more discussion on other conflicts such as those in Ireland or terrorist acts carried out by North Korea (the ultimate example of state-sponsored terrorism), but they are either nowhere to be found or completely dismissed.  Dershowitz carefully pares down his topic until he ignores practically everything in our century outside of 9-11 and the PLO.     His anti-Palestinian bias becomes more apparent later in his arguments.  His central idea is that terrorist groups feed off the success of other groups.  Because Palestinian terrorism is the most effective terrorist campaign in the world, for the sake of world security they must be defeated.  However, if you follow this logic it becomes apparent that he leaves no room for the possibility that the Palestinians might have a legitimate complaint or that perhaps they deserve certain rights that we in the US generally consider inaliable.  According to his argument, the Palestinians can never see any improvement in their situation, no matter how deserved, because such would be perceived as a victory for terrorism.  Therefore, as far as Dershowitz is concerned, they're just plain out of luck.     Dershowitz's attitude seems to be that the Palestinians should have tried nonviolent protest instead of violence.  He seems oblivious to the fact that the Israelis used violence to sieze Palestine in the first place, and while he admits that Israelis use terrorist-style violence, he never judges them in the same way he judges the Palestinians.    In fact, Dershowitz advocates the use of torture and assassination and seems to praise the Israeli use of these tactics.  I'm at a loss to explain how anyone can advocate nonviolent protest at the same time that they advocate assassination and praise 'preemptive' warfare.  I'm likewise unable to understand how anyone can caution us as to the steady erosion of our freedoms at the same time that they argue for state-sponsored torture.    To his credit, Dershowitz reminds us that even hated terrorists have constitutional rights, and he makes a plea for us to remember that even terrorists deserve due process of law.  But again, his hyprocrisy is stunningly blatant.  How can one argue for universal judicial fairness and advocate torture and assassination at the same time?  These concepts are completely antithetical to a fair, democratic judicial process.       The most frightening argument Dershowitz makes is that it is alright to allow our rights to be degraded as long as the "feel of freedom" is maintained.  (His words, not mine)  He claims that as long as our free speech is protected and our media is critical, it is alright for us to sacrifice our freedom in other ways.       In fact, Dershowitz admits that Palestinians in Israel are second-class citizens, and then says they should be thankful for it because Israel has free speech and a balanced judicial system.  I was previously unaware that bulldozing towns and bombing Palestinian civilians constituted a fair judicial system, and it really is a shame that too few Palestinians actually live long enough to enjoy it.     Anyone who reads this book should be frightened to live in a future Dershowitz America 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 At the end of her TV shows it states  For entertainment only  So is her book for entertainment only???????????  I like Personal Finance for Dummies. Some "Dummies" books are too simple and have to many jokes but Personal Finance for Dummies is pretty good.  
 I have been reading James Patterson's books since the first Alex Cross came out. I thought the first 3 or 4 Cross books were brilliant but since then I feel the standard has dropped gradually to where we reach London Bridges.  This book has a solid storyline that needed fleshing out but I think the author was in too much of a rush to get the book on the shelves to worry about the story.  Let me get this right - Alex's family are taken hostage in the final few pages of the book, we get a couple of pages devoted to Cross' work and then the family is returned. There was no discussion on the anguish Alex was facing, nothing on the fear that the family was facing, nothing written about this at all! It would have been better to have taken them at the start of the book and have the book devoted to the fear that Alex was facing and his determination to catch the Wolf and get his family back.  If Alex was so dedicated to catching the Wolf, why was he taking so many time-outs throughout the book to visit little Alex, have dinner with his numerous friends etc?  Most disappointing, Mr Patterson 
 The publisher should be convinced that the automatic spell checker should not be so heavily relied upon.  The cover art is an expression of how an armchair graphic artist can be innovative with Photoshop.  If a book of such high esteem be put out for public enrichment its presentation should not be so insincere 
 This was like reading a year's worth of newspapers at once.  There is absolutely nothing worthwhile that even the most casual Yankee fan doesn't know.  (Jeter and A-Rod don't get along?  you're kidding!)  This was clearly slapped together and put out to coincide with the start of the baseball season.  I read a lot of baseball books and this is waaaayyyyy at the bottom.  
 Today the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) reported that although American high school seniors are getting better academic grades, their literacy and mathematics skills are actually regressing. The most likely culprit: grade inflation. Yet the drumbeat among elite educrats to adopt the Professional Learning Communities fad throughout the nation's high schools continues unabated. While PLC is certainly not to blame for the trend documented by these latest NAEP figures (it hasn't been around long enough), its dumbfounding popularity among education reformers is proof that the current educational leadership in this country is not to be trusted. How should we define "academic achievement"? Both PLC and (to a lesser extent) the federal No Child Left Behind law define it as all students performing at the same level and all teachers teaching their subjects the same way. In other words, the goal of PLC is conformity--the exact opposite of what a quality education in a democratic society should stand for.  When teachers and students are pressured to conform to the same standards, it is inescapable that the standards themselves must be mediocre. The kind of school climate advocated by DuFour will only lead to more teachers handing out more A's for less work, or for inferior work. The most gifted and motivated students will have to be ignored because of the constant pressure on teachers to keep the low end of the student population from failing. But what if we started at the high end of the spectrum instead, teaching everything as if it were an honors class? Our brightest and most hardworking students might achieve their full potential and save us all from the intellectual wasteland our country is becoming. The middle and low-end students would have to struggle to keep up. And yes, a lot of them would be likely to fail...at least until they discovered the will to apply themselves and take their own education seriously. It would be a hard lesson for them, but a valuable one in the long run.  Unfortunately, there are no well-funded think-tanks, education professors, or consultants advocating this approach at the moment. 
 I truly wanted to like this book.  After years of avoidance I had just finished Moby Dick and found it not only more readable than I'd feared but downright enjoyable.  In addition I'd heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me, and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature:  "Captain Ahab was neither my first husband nor my last."  Alas, it was all down hill from there; overall this is one of the worst books I've ever forced myself to finish.  This came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack.  Author of two other published novels and a short story collection, director of a university level creative writing program, long-term teacher of writing, and holder of a Ph.D. in same, all to considerable critical acclaim, she should be correcting and grading (failing) garbage like this not producing it.  So what went wrong?  How did this novel end up so awful?  The answer is brick by brick and piece by piece.  There is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things.  LENGTH: If "brevity is the soul of wit", this novel's witlessness is easily explained.  At 666 pages (interesting number that) this novel is about three times as long as it should have been.  It would seem that, to some extent like Melville before her, Naslund confused Length with Importance, but Melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is.  IMHO this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing Naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self-parody.  Somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel, but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing... with a meat axe or a chainsaw.  THE NAME DROPPING: One of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures, but if badly handled these encounters can un-suspend disbelief and downright offend.  They are badly handled here.  An almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of Kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid-nineteenth century New England and those she doesn't utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with Naslund's peculiar imagining of Nathaniel Hawthorne.  One or two of these, developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude.  As it is, it is a Zelig or a Forrest Gump without the humor (or the self-awareness).  THE POLITICS: Even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid-nineteenth century New Englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel, so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing.  However, Naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having Una espouse the Politically Correct view on every single controversy of the day (and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day) from slavery to whaling, from feminism to free love, from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled, all without consequence or even criticism.  This latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves.  Una espouses them with all the negative consequences that Naslund receives for espousing them today, which is to say: none.  THE ANTI-CHRISTIAN BIGOTRY: There is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid-nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time, but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted.  It is even sillier to portray Christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish, the bigoted, the future apostate, or the mentally ill.  It tells us more about the author than anything else that Una is openminded towards every religious and quasi-religious idea of the time EXCEPT Christianity.  THE FARFETCHED SCENARIOS: I sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which Una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi-lesbian encounter....  After this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic.  After her crazy Christian father threatens to kill her (a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand), Una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal-minded aunt and uncle, encounters two young men who both fall in love with her, disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them, successfully avoids detection, is sunk by a whale, survives by committing cannibalism, marries the surviving young man after he goes insane, and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the Indians, leaving her free to "marry" Captain Ahab (Una never really "marries" anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes).  Things don't get more realistic in the second half, which includes Una's clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale.  Riiiight.  THE MARY SUE: However, the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a "Mary Sue" that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader.  A more realistic main character might have saved it.  Una never learns anything from her life's too-many-to-be-believed experiences because she already knows everything.  She doesn't change because she is already perfect.  She doesn't have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn't receive any, and she doesn't have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides, Una had her reasons (and they were very good ones you can be sure).  The only thing I can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone WITHOUT anyone ever reading it.  I feel like I've just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading Moby Dick in her bedroom... with the door locked. 
 I agree with most of the negative reviewers about this, especially the one who pointed out that there were no "Mysteries". The criticisms are quite accurate: the tone is glib, condescending and jocular, what could be called Best Seller/talk show host prose: nothing too strenuous or meaningful. Bill Maher does the High Middle Ages. This is certainly the prevalent view: "nowadays, we know all about it". There is no sense of humility before a subject no one human could possibly understand nor of the feelings evoked by the great works of art of the era, compared to which the 20th century had very little.   
 I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list 
 The 4 CD mini Gibson Amp 'box-set'leaves off genuine off vinyl 78, and Lp 'harder-to-get' Charlie Christian/Benny Goodman recordings.  Legacy states "MASTER TAKES", but absolutely fails to research deep into Charlie Christian's recording history. Columbia vinyl 2Lp 30779, (1972), and Columbia 78rpm C -102 along with the Columbia "Sextet" Cds leave legacy far behind. The Wang Wang Blues -78rpm isn't in the 4CD set, and there are far too many 'false-starts', which Benny Goodman discarded for a good reason.  Star Dust is only about 3 minutes, it's 8 minutes on vinyl.  There is even In-studio handclapping after some tunes. I have the 78s, many Col. Lps, and there is no "Studio-Live" takes.  This 4 CD box could have, and should have been much better in information, content and genuine Charlie Christian guitar stylings.  The 2 readily available BG Sextet Cds are a better purchase idea, but there are still those super hard-to-get vinyl Lp tracks, which ARE "The Master Takes", left Off the legacy/Sony box set.  Musicologist's suggestion, try to get the vinyl Lps.  Skip this misleading 4 CD set of various tracks, + handclapping = NOT "Good Enough To Keep", (AirMail Special). Try the 2 Benny Goodman/Charlie Christian Columbia CDs, Amazon has both, and most of the Benny Goodman Sextet 'takes' are Master Takes, and "Good Enough To Keep! 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 I don't know what is happening with authors these days, but with each book they seem to get worse and Catherine Coulter is following trend. Ms. Coulter's early works such as "The Legacy Trilogy", "The Magic Trilogy" were really good, but "Pengragon"  was very bad. I didn't realy care about the either of the main characters and the only reason that read the book was the fact that I spent over eight dollars for it. Maybe Ms. Coulter and others should take a break and take the time to write a book that is worth its money 
 Reading through John Irving's "The Cider House Rules," I found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity. In obtaining a bachelor's degree in English, I had to read a lot of books. Among them were many books that I did not like, but never before had I read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety.   Every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along. People become pregnant, have abortions, and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens. This goes way beyond mere foreshadowing. The book doesn't flow naturally, you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows, playing the puppet master. There are just so many coincidences, so many old friends just happening to run into eachother, so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly, all of the characters vaguely, distantly connected to eachother. I don't want to spoil the plot, but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the Eames (rhymes with screams) family is just too much coincidence to bear. It's as though the author is God, and the characters completely lack free will.  And then there's the "protagonist," Homer Wells. I put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story, Homer Wells barely does anything in the story. He barely even speaks during the story. He is virtually a non-character, devoid of personality or will, around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve. The scenes that do not involve Homer Wells at all, and they make up the majority of the book, are without fail the most interesting scenes. I think that the real protagonist of the book is Dr. Larch, but even Melony seems more real than Homer does.   The story is very long and rambling. Subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on. Minor characters keep popping into the story, then disappearing, only to pop back into the story exactly when they're needed. Conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten (like the situation with Debra Pettigrew).   After such a rambling, at times rather boring plot, the ending feels rather rushed. It is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything, tie up every loose end, in the last 25 pages (and tying up loose ends, in this case, means a lot of people conveniently dying). To spoil the plot just a little, Homer Wells, who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul, suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion. I personally am pro-choice as well, but I found that Homer's sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily-ever-afters 
 Gabriel Noone is a 53 year old gay man with his own radio show which comes on at 11 PM. He's upset because his lover of 10 years has left because he needed space. Into his life comes a book written by 13 year old Pete Lomax (although it took him 2 years to write the book and he began it when he was 12 - so he should be at least 14) about the abuse he suffered at the hands of his parents and the pedophiles they sold him to. Pete has been listening to Gabriel's show and admires him very much.  Well, Gabe calls up little Pete and begins a friendship. He tells  Pete all his personal problems and Pete sympathizes and gives him   advice.  Later, he begins to doubt Pete's existence because no one has ever seen him. He lives with his adoptive mom Donna - sometimes she's a PhD psychologist, and sometimes she's a psychiatrist (MD) - according to Gabe anyway. (Gabe also has a lot of issues with his Dad - which are neatly resolved by the end).  The movie version goes into much more depth, and is much spookier and actually thought provoking regarding Donna' motives, without dwelling on unnecessary sexual descriptions and details that are important on Gabe's agenda.  It's unlikely that anyone would believe that a 13 year old boy would listen to NPR, or even know what it was. Much less have the patience to listen to a grown man's whining about his love life.  See the movie 
 I don't like the fact that somebody can take a horror movie and turn it into a joke!I couldn't even get through this movie once.I just don't like films that express monsters as four-legged dog creatures.The Relic is a story about a ritual gone wrong when some foolish explorer actually drinks this weird concoction from a tribe of Indians.Mysteriously enough,the liquid turns him into a beastly creature that lives in the sewers under a mansion.Don't get this movie 
 This movie is Bloodsport minus the entertaining parts. Better production value- much worse script. Much worse everything almost. So if you liked Bloodsport which even at its cheesiest was a classic entertaining martial arts flick and you wanted to see another version of it that sucks but has more scenery, well here you go! Enjoy 
 Misled by its title, I was expecting that this book was about making rustic furniture. However only the last third of the book is about this. Two thirds of the books (100 p.) consists in  a gallery of pictures (with some comments), mostly chairs. Their style is not modern, but not traditional either. I find most to be weird or snob. Actually many look postmodern to me (they may not all be from the author, but from his friends -many being also from New York City like him). These may be a source of inspiration for some, but definitely not what I am looking for.  And that last third of the book, about making things is also quite a deception in itself. It is a collection of shallow articles by other authors, who show projects they make,   with a very vague and general talk about the technique they use. One uses tenons and mortises (anyone knowing a bit about conventional woodworking will not learn anything here), and worse, others use nails and even bolts (the last one). I really learned nothing from this. In addition, this is all about dry wood.   I recommend instead Les Smith's Build your own Log Furniture (only a little bit of technique, for dry softwood, but at least something...), and much more a book where you really can learn many things: Drew Langsner's Green Woodworking 
 They call it brainless fun, but it's not even fun.  Yes, "Stealth" is that not-rare-enough bad movie that's actually so bad, it's no fun.  It starts out bad from the beginning - with an on-screen title sequence dating this film "In the Near Future", which should trip alarms for anybody whose ever watched an episode of "Mystery Science Theater 3000".  The heroes of our story - three pilots assigned to fly hyper-tech US fighters called "Talons" - are reluctantly joined by a fourth pilot, a robotic fighter jet called EDI.  Trouble starts immediately when EDI develops an acute case of self-awareness and faster than you can say "I'm sorry Dave, I really can't do that", EDI is ignoring orders and raising all sorts of havoc.  It's hard to get more specific without ruining the plot...because there really isn't any plot.  The story we see on the screen hints at several different plot-ideas that never form into a single story - we have the plot about stopping "Crazy EDI"; the plot about the evil admiral played by Sam Shepard who will do anything he can to keep the lid on EDI when he goes bad; we have Jessica Biel as a fighter pilot running from the bad guys after she's shutdown over North Korea; then we have Josh Lucas as the other Talon pilot whose on the run from some goons who are trying to...Oh, who cares?  None of these plots go anywhere.  BUT WHAT ABOUT THEM EFFEX?? "Stealth" offers us hours of aerial dogfighting in unsurpassed CGI - unsurpassed because the movie demonstrates that there are some things that simply can't be left to computer animation.  Even though they're next generation aircraft, the F/A-37 Talon fighters never convincingly look like any airplanes, and the aerial effects here look little more believable than those done over 20 years ago in "Firefox" or "Deal of the Century", or nowadays on any flight simulator game run on any desktop-PC.  The effects compound the error by maximizing use of "impossible shots" - shots that couldn't be seen by a human perspective, such as those that cut across the sky and directly inside the subject aircraft - it's a clever shot, but not a terrible smart one (they never stop reminding us that these are effects).  It's probably too much effort to explain that even elite fighter pilots don't want to be confused by a flight panel that suddenly starts broadcasting real-time images of a bunch of terrorists sitting down as if for a CNN foto-op, or that none of the pilots come off as even casual aviators.  "Stealth" is one of those mindless movies that effete snobbish reviewers like to blame on teenage boys, but this flick lost a ton of money (stealthy profits) which is only strong proof that the monster audience of mindless boys is itself a delusion of these frustrated critics and studio execs, or even stronger proof that those mindless teenage boys may be smarter than anybody realizes 
 A work of fiction is a great thing, but to take the life of a famous historical character and potray it as accurate is wrong.  Why not just make up a story with no historical basis 
 I've had these speakers for about 3 years now and I'm really not happy them. There is some hissing but that is to be expected with wireless speakers. The most annoying thing is the popping noises. I have tried moving the speakers closer to the transmitter only to find that the distance makes no difference. I thought the popping noise was some kind of local interference so I actually walked all around the yard but the noise stayed the same. I got a warranty replacement of the transmitter because when I moved the attached antenna it caused static in the speakers and I thought perhaps the antenna was somehow not properly connected inside the housing but the popping noise persisted.   I can't recommend these speakers. Best to consider others. 
 This guy may be a feted author/chef/whatever but none of his recipes (the ones I have tried anyway) work.  I have a couple of his books (cake and cookie) and I intend to chuck them out.  I bake quite frequently and get it right 99% of the time including recipes from Martha Stewart, Susan Purdy, Doris Greenspan, Jim Foley...I can go on.  Have never bothered writing a review before but everyone, please don't buy his books.  And he sounds like a real prima donna.  
 This is not one for the uncoordinated.  I only tried it once, and have no desire to try it again.  Also beware that this is not the best pick if you have only a small space.  
 Every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor/actress in it that everything will turn out good. Blue Steel is one of those movies. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties (or should I say murders) which she did not commit. Sounds like an interesting plot, right? It would be had the script not been so poorly written. The supporting actors give such a bland/typical performance that not even Jamie Lee could have saved the dialogue. Aside from the acting, the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises. Some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop (Jamie Lee) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her. So why do I give Blue Steel an extra star? Well, I'll just say that if you are a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television. Just don't pay over $3 to rent it and certainly don't buy it 
 Totally disappointing.  From the beginning the novel read well, but like a Sherlock Holmes mystery at the end the person who committed the crimes came out of the blue .  I, personally, do not like reading this type of mystery....I want clues.  Alas, there were none.  Also, the characters did not make sense.....most were too undeveloped.....Mr. Patterson needs to go back to the drawing board & try to forget the $$$ he is being paid up front by the publisher 
 So much could have been done with this story, but was not. While this book shines at descriptions of political events, it utterly fails to give context a current reader will need, and by indulging in every whim of detail without giving as clear a picture as even would have been needed in the time, it inundates us with fragments without showing a convincing experience. I hope Woodward and Bernstein wrote better newspaper stories, because while I was compelled to read the content of this book, it was not a pleasant venture into highly repetitive, aimless description. Not sure I'd recommend this to anyone, no matter how many overpaid hacks call it a "classic. 
 The author who is Jewish spent far too much time on Koufax being Jewish.  As a biography it was poor.  Jews may appreciate the book, but gentiles probably won't.  The book didn't take you through enough of Sandy's life or his career as it seems to emphasize 1965.  I usually like to read biographies rather than auto biographies, but I've read many auto bios which are better.  The author may have been hampered by the fact that Sandy is so quiet and reserved that he makes a poor subject for a biography.  There's a caption under a picture about Sandy being twice divorced, but only a few sentences about his first marriage.  Don't waste your money on this book 
 This is the most intellegent powerful music ever! Smart lyrics, catchy instrumetns, powerful voice.   Haha I lied. Rap is NOT music, it is idiotism! Every person who likes it is an idiot!  
 These are just OK, not great. I have 2 pairs of the clic readers and I love them. The sunglasses, however, are not as sturdy, the adjustment feature does not work on my pair and I just cannot endorse them. I am disappointed as I am a huge fan of the clic readers and could not wait for the sunglasses. It's a shame 
 Maybe the worst "thriller" I've read in years. The dialogue, characters and plot are at best soap opera material and that's giving it a positive spin. I hope Mr. Hosp is a good lawyer....and we all know what Wm. Shakespeare said about that profession 
 After decades of imperialism, the West has received a violent response to its state terror.  It seems that Pipes expects our victims to applaud while we steal resources, support dictators, litter their nations with depleted uranium, impose lethal sanctions, and commit other crimes.  As Ward Churchill has pointed out, sometimes people push back. Amazingly, most of the victims of US state terror don't respond in a militant fashion.  We haven't had Cambodians, East Timorese, Guatemalans, Chileans or others come to our military empire and do something violent in response.  That says something about how people are mostly peaceful and non-vengeful.  But with propagandists like Pipes, the US will remain a frightened, brutal empire that feels it has some sort of right to abuse Arabs and other people of the global South. The sort of people who take Pipes seriously have some psychological or emotional need to be deceived, and to have their attention deflected from their country's crimes.  So many US citizens go to work each day to build the cluster bombs that will kill Iraqis, or pilot the Apache helicopters that are killing tribal people in Afghanistan (helicopters named after a tribe we exterminated in an earlier crusade).  That ugly reality bothers people, and some welcome the stories of someone like Pipes who will say, "It's not our corporate militarism, it's those people with no weapons factories that are really trying to take over the world."   What a sick joke. For people who have a vague interest in reality, I'd suggest reading Chalmers Johnson, a Korean war veteran who wrote "Blowback" and "The Sorrows of Empire." There's also a new documentary by Eugene Jarecki about Militant America called "Why We Fight."  It features the words of radical leftists like Dwight Eisenhower, warning us about a military industrial complex 
 I'm taking a course which uses this book as the main textbook, and I find its explanations poorly written.  I would suggest buying the book "Computer Arithmetic Algorithms, 2nd Edition" by Israel Koren instead, which covers the same material in a manner I find more straightforward 
 If you are looking for an XBOX vertsion of another chapter in MechWarrior series, this ISN'T it. This is an extemely dumbed-down version of MW. Even if you (Mechwarrior fans) forget about having no customization, remember this: You can only fire one weapon at at time. You have to cycle between lazers, cannons and rockets. I was bored after about 5 minutes.  Again, people who never played MW series may like this game better 
 What is this book?? It is nothing more than a guy that had the means to put out a book of crazy nonesence. The only good part of the book is the intro by paul. I really cant follow these stories/poems at all.   Just thought id round out the bottom end of the ratings 
 this book was not all that i'd hoped it would be; i was very disappointed.  why?  1)  it was poorly organized. 2)  it was hard to trudge through, not a joy like other books. 3)  there was too much personal info about the author that had nothing to do with 'the trouble with africa'. 4)  there was posturing and self-congratulation that i found really distasteful.  the author may indeed have gotten a lot closer to the poor than the other aid workers or local government officials, and he may indeed have received awards at the village level, but that really has nothing to do with 'the trouble with africa' either. 5)  what was actually worthwhile here only filled 20 pages

 The Crossing is set in New Mexico and Mexico in the late 1930s, during the last days of the Wild West before the onslaught of the motor car ends the frontier once and for all.  	The story is centred on two adolescent, monsyllabilic farmer's sons in New Mexico. When a wolf comes up from Mexico the farmer and his two sons decide to set traps and catch the wolf. McCarthy takes us into the mind of the wolf and an interesting, but sadly short, period of the book ends when the older son, alone, catches the wolf. Here he decides, rather than kill it, to return it to Mexico from where it came. When he reaches Mexico he is surprised to find the Mexicans don't see his generosity in quite the same light. After they commandeer the wolf and set it to fighting dogs Billy shoots it, and drifts through Mexico before returning home where he finds his parents murdered by horse thieves. An obvious plot at this stage would be for them to seek revenge but no. Instead they become thieves themselves and we find ourselves heading back to Mexico, with an unclear goal except to find their horses, a big country in which to find half a dozen horses, and our two protagonists becoming less and less likeable by the page. It is a pity that although McCarthy manages to take us into the mind of the wolf he never once reveals what the two boys are thinking, nor why. What motivates Billy and Boyd? For the entire book we never find out.  	 They meet a girl in an encounter that will be confusing to anyone who does not speak fluent Spanish. They also meet several Mexicans, some with their parent's horses, and they reacquire some of the horses in equally confusing scenes. Later Boyd, the younger brother, runs off with the girl; Billy returns to the USA, tries and fails to join the army (we are now in the 1940s) and so works on various ranches before returning to Mexico, for the third time, to find his brother.  	In `The Crossing' there are in fact three `crossings' into Mexico, which is projected as a lawless country full of generally unpleasant people, much like the USA. In fact, through the book there are few endearing, likeable characters that the reader can actually root for; the wolf and one or two horses are the possible exceptions. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish and difficult to follow. McCarthy may be pleased with himself for speaking Spanish but many readers of English literature do not and with so much dialogue in Spanish, and untranslated, it makes the story difficult to follow. 	This is further aggravated by a lack of proper punctuation. Mr McCarthy should remember that punctuation is something that has evolved with the English language and is there to make the language more comprehensible. To eliminate this not only distracts readers from what you are saying, but stops readers from enjoying the writing. Reading a sentence of 80 words without so much as a comma is very hard work. Lawyers often omit punctuation when writing a legal document to protect them legally. At times, `The Crossing' was much like reading a legal document, you need to read each sentence twice to understand exactly what McCarthy is saying.  Yet McCarthy still gives a compelling story described in vivid locations. Behind the faade of Spanish dialogue, unpunctuated English and dull characters there is a powerful storyteller at work here. It is a pity he chooses two charisma free lads having a loosely connected series of mini-adventures to express himself 
 Based upon other positive reviews I had high hopes for this book being informative, but it bases its data more on speculation than on fact.  When this book was first written at the time of the "revolution" (in 1979), the author wrote that he had heard that Israeli soldiers were part of the Shah's defense forces in attacks against anti-Shah rioters.  But twenty years later by the time of this 2001 re-publication, the author had not been able to ascertain that Israeli units had indeed been part of the Shah's defense forces -- speculation on rumor, but no determinable fact, although the anti-Shah forces had twenty years to comb through Iranian documents.  As the author presents a thin-bone background to the theology of Shi'ism, a reader is left powerfully hungry in looking for some 'meatiness' to the author's explanations.  Although this book is based upon four lectures that the author gave shortly after the 1979 revolution, the author rambles about in trying to make some coherent story. The author explains that the Shiite are split between two schools of thought, the Usuli and the Akhbaris, as to whether or not modern Shiites can "engage in independent reasoning with respect to legal questions" in the absence of the Hidden Imam.  The author examines this issue as it underpins the development of Ayatollah Khomeini's rebellion against the Shah: Khomeini argued that Shiite imams needed to take an active role in fomenting Islamic rebellion against the pro-secular Shah, rather than remaining passive.  The author all too briefly notes one of the imams' complaints against the Shah: that he was taking mosque-controlled lands and selling it to private individuals and thereby curtailing their income from those properties.  The author does not hide his pro-Shiite faith.  In response to one question asked of the author in 1979 as to whether or not he agreed that: "If national boundaries were taken away....the differences between Sunni and Shi'i would disappear in one instant", the author replied back then: "Very definitely."  However, twenty years later, by 2001 the author apparently had had a good dressing down by his Shi'i superiors and had to add a corrective footnote: "the differences themselves are deep-rooted and ultimately irreducible" (pg. 81).  This is not a book to read to learn about Shi'ism.  It is more of a television "talking heads" presentation based from several public lectures; a lot of polemics, but short on fact regarding riot casualties.  It barely rates being worthwhile for reading in understanding how the anti-Shah movement developed.  It is barely worth reading for a background 'feel' as to why religious leaders (imams) should be the only ruling leaders of an Islamic government (mujtahid); the people may vote for only those candidates who have prior approval from the imams and who toe the Shi'i theology.  This isn't a textbook, it is more of a compilation of "off the cuff" extemporaneous remarks in a lecture hall. Okay for a novice just starting to explore this topic, but read it at the library before buying it.  
 it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces.  look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good 
 Wow. Good thing I didn't buy this book.  Looking at all these reviews there seems to be two catagories of people who rate this book.  The normal people catagory and the bling bling people who cash in on this book only to recommend their own books. And when you look at their profiles and see what books they have reviewed it's very little. It's obvious people want to cash in the name of the books ("Men are from Mars....)  One reviewer talks about his sex drive being improved then recommends his own book.  Seriously, shut up.  We live in a society where sex sells and the idea of if you want to be beautiful you have to get this book.  Don't be fooled. This book is BS and you will feel bad because another diet didn't work.  There are better diet books out there. John Gray is just trying to cash in in the weight loss craze just like Dr. Phil.  AND if you truly want to lose weight and need discipline weight watchers is great. If you are reading this you are a smart consumer don't invest in this poser, wanna be diet book. 
 I tried reading this book twice but it was such a waste of energy that I had to give up or lose my mind.    At least the second time I persisted until chapter 21, much longer than the first try which was a mere 2 chapters 
 Very disappointed to find out the size was wrong.  I should have looked at the other reviews and I would never have bought it.  It was sent as a gift and I am not happ 
 This book has some great content; however, as a Mac user, I was disappointed that nowhere does the author point out cross-platform differences. I realize Windows is the dominant OS, but Acrobat is just as much (if not more, as a a percentage) used on the Mac. Shame on the author for not even bothering to mention the differences 
 Chambers seems to cover the required material for Mac OS 10.3 OK, but he could have said it in less than half of the 692 pages if he kept his all-to-frequent attempts to be entertaining out of the book.   Example: ". . . drag the default bar at the bottom of the window to the toolbar at the top. This is the toolbar equivalent of tapping your ruby slippers together three times and repeating, 'There's no place like home.'" (p.-175). He carries on like this to the point of distraction.   I would recommend two other books: Easy Mac OS X, v10.3 Panther ©2004 (288 pages) by Kate Binder - much more clear than Chambers, and has lots of screen shots to show how to set up and use OS X. The second book, Mac OS X Panther Unleashed ©2004 (1673 pages) by John & William C. Ray - delves into technical details, but also covers all the information non-technical users need 
 This should have been titled, "1001 Ways Other People Took Initiative, But Aren't Applicable To What You Do". Bob Nelson's latest in the series is little more than a non-stop string of industry stories and reader comments solicited from the web. This book does not aid in taking initiative because the "examples" are provided without comment or insight into how to apply this more generally; it's far too specific to be of use to anyone else.  What remains, including comments from professionals and researchers, has some value but is insignificant for the size of the book. The insights Nelson provides are distinctly unoriginal and will be well known to anyone who's ever read another book on empowerment or efficiency 
 If you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in! Also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet.  They are made with known cancer causing chemicals. They are also manufactured over seas wher the DEQ,EPA etc; have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers.  My two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage. Did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers. Benzene, Poly Vinyl Chloride, all kill the liver. 
 The film-makers will walk the plank in shark infested waters for this one. Blackbeards ghost does not wander around a random college campus making smart comments, pulling lame pranks, and acting like a low-life burn-out loser, I do. Blackbeard is obviously drunk on his ghost-ship in the caribbean. The film-makers are obviously the heirs to filthy british royalty carrying out a plot to give pirates everywhere a bad name.   
 Unauthorized? I would add to that, unethical, and possibly illegal. This DVD is nothing more than an attempt to make money off of Nickelback's talent and hard work. The band had no involvement in this "bottom of the barrel" production and would be appalled that fan's are being cheated. Hopefully they are aware of this and have taken legal action. If not, maybe the fans ought to tell them. I'm going to 
 If you want information about installing and restoring slate roofs, this is not the book.  This is more of an unusual coffee table book.  It shows slate roofs from around the world, and if you are a professional roofer, you might be able to buy some equipment from Joe Jenkins.  It tells how hard the work is, and that you should keep your slate roof.  
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

  Mad cow disease finally gets its own horror flick with this latest offering from Fangoria and the Irish Film Board. In this case, this ultra-violent strain of mad cow disease can be passed on to humans, turning them into zombies. It's hard to think of this set-up as being anything but a rip-off of 28 DAYS LATER with cows instead of monkeys being the initial carrier of the infection.  So this bovine infection starts causing people to attack each other in rural Ireland. Maybe I'm just getting numbed by all the zombie movies, but this one seemed like a weak attempt to capitalize on the zombie craze. Unfortunately, I think that the expiration date on zombie movies may be coming soon, if it's not already passed.  There's one pretty good moment where this girl sucks out a guy's eye with a vacuum cleaner, but otherwise this is a pretty standard zombie flick. You just can't make the same old zombie movie and expect people to be scared. You have to find a way to make it unique. Look at poor George Romero, who returned to the genre that he helped create, only to find mediocre box office success. As much as I hate to admit it, it might be time for filmmakers to take a little break from zombie movies, at least until they can find a fresh approach.   This dead meat is not fresh or very nutritional. It's more like meat loaf. When you've got meat that's about to go bad, sometimes the only thing you can do is mix it up with other ingredients and make it into meat loaf.

 For an adult beginner, this book is of very limited value. It cannot be used to learn the piano, but is only a general guide for someone who already has a substantial musical background. I would not buy this book if  you are an absolute beginner other than to read a sometimes interesting  story about how a more advanced player practices and learns to play the  pian 
 I just got my copy of the DVD R-Rated version and yes the best parts of the bondage scene are missing. Why those edit happy bozos would remove the lower body scenes showing the actresses powerful legs around her captor and leave the breasts showing is beyond me. Since this scene is most appealing in the way the Original version first displayed it in 85, to take it out in my opinion degrades the movie entirely. I was completely dissapointed in this version of the movie. If anyone saw the unrated 1985 Vhs version you would know what I mean. Lana was the movie. Why remove it????? I have [not a] clue!!!

 Immortel (ad vitam) (Enki Bilal, 2004)  While I was not overly impressed with Bilal's Nikopol Trilogy on the page, I figured a film made out of it could be a pretty fun ride, and with Bilal himself at the helm, I had high hopes for it. Most of them, unfortunately, were dashed in the first few minutes.  The one thing everyone agrees on is that the film looks quite nice. And it does-- some of the CGI faces are so realistic they put me in mind of the best scenes in the Final Fantasy film. And the integration of actual actors and CGI characters is often seamless. The "sets," though, are second-rate Bladerunner wannabes. There was a lot of potential in them, and most of it was wasted.  The acting, even when delivered by some pretty high-powered acting talent (Charlotte Rampling, for example), is atrocious. The two main actors, Linda Hardy (who, aside from this, has yet to land a major role) and Thomas Kretschmann (soon to be seen  in the film adaptation of The Celestine Prophecy) are both wooden. Rampling injects a touch of vivacity into her role now and then, but it's not nearly enough.  The plot is... well, I can definitively say there is a plot. And that it is, in fact, connected to the Nikopol Trilogy in some way. But when you don't meet the character of Nikopol until half an hour into a hundred-minute film, that should tip you off that things aren't staying completely faithful to the book. There are scenes you'll recognize, if you've read the Nikopol Trilogy, but I can tell you from experience: having read it does not make this movie any more lucid. In fact, it may add to the confusion.  In short, aside from the visually appealing aspect, I can't find a single thing about this movie to recommend to, well, anyone.  
 I didn't enjoy the film.  I also didn't enjoy the original play by Shakespeare.  King Lear is one of my least favorite Shakespeare plays.  I don't consider it particularly creative to remake a play that has already been done, and to add nothing of value to the original.  You can set it wherever you like, in medieval Japan or on the Moon, what's the difference.  It's King Lear, a downer of a play, there's nothing great about Ran just as there's nothing great about Lear, and it takes up three hours of your time.  A moron named Lear, or Hidetoro, or whatever his name is, relinquishes power in his kingdom and turns the power over to his oldest son.  The youngest son warns him that it is a bad idea because the sons will be disloyal to their father.  He is right, of course, and Hidetoro Lear gets treated shabbily.  He's wanted dead or dead.  In this treatment of the annoying plot, he loses his mind.  He has a faithful follower or two.  They overact.  There is nobody to root for in this depressing and ridiculously overrated downer of a play.  Lear Hidetoro is an absolute jerk.  Am I supposed to care what happens to him?  Why?  Because he used to be a powerful king, and a cruel one?  You may as well cry over Saddam Hussein.  Look at this movie with fresh eyes.  Look at Shakespeare's King Lear with fresh eyes.  This stuff simply is not very entertaining, and is not very good.  The hell with King Lear.  He's an annoyance 
 The title of this book is a misnomer as there is very little about the making of the hydrogen bomb in it. I can't remember the last time I was this disappointed in a book. There are hundreds of pages spent detailing the Soviet spy program during WWII while the USA was trying to build the atomic bomb. The scientists and their contacts and where they met and what they said to each other and what the Soviet scientists did with the information and on and on in mind-numbing minutiae. This information is all well and good, but that's not why I bought the book. The hydrogen bomb isn't touched on for 350 or 400 pages and then it still seems to spend more time on the Soviets and their attempts to catch up to the American program.  The writing is fine, if not stimulating, it just seems to be off track most of the time. I wanted to read about Teller, Oppenheimer, Ulam, Feynman and all the rest and their conversations, disagreements, failures and ultimate successes in creating the hydrogen bomb. What I got was a heavy dose of Klaus Fuchs and the rest who stole every item they could and sold it to the Russians. This is an important story, but it's not the one I wanted to read about and not the story the book purported to tell 
 "Our Kind," Kate Walbert's novel-in-stories about the psychological malaise afflicting women who became adults in the 1950s and who are now confronting life in their 60s, never achieves its intriguing premise.  Walbert's individual stories lack coherence; her prose tends to be overwritten, precious or overly obscure; her characters rarely invite sympathy or compassion, much less understanding.  Though Walbert intends "Our Kind" to provide insight into the genuine existential dilemmas aging women experience, the novel is really little more than a litany of sorror that poor little rich girls  --  now women  -- encounter.  Each character, whether she be physically disabled, ditzy, an artist, a widow, cancer-stricken, jaded or booze-addled, has been "led down a primrose lane, then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond."  Forsaking intellectual aspirations and career possibilities contemporary women now presume as birthrights, these erudite, Smith-educated, polished (like prized apples) and repressed (orgasm-starved) characters chose or had chosen for them a life of taking "dictation from war heroes in grey suits."  Their college curriculum consisted of the "3 G's:  Grace, Grooming and Grammar.  Some of us dropped out before Grace."  They did everthing their men asked them to:  be homemakers, silent hostesses, acquiescent sexual partners and mothers.  Yet, somewhere, by middle age, the wheels had fallen off.  The women of "Our Kind" keen with pain and betrayal.  Their collective voices form a chorus of sorrow and lament, not the presupposed aria of joy, contentment and fulfillment they had envisioned hearing.  "Our Kind" is a filled with an ineluctable sadness and no small amount of unresolved bitterness.  The women, budding with excitement in their 20s, now have gone to seed.  And what a disparate assortment of seeds...hair greying, unspoken anger bubbling over, regrets denouncing false hopes.  Their loneliness slaps them daily across their reconstructed faces.  Each character, because of Walbert's preculiar, ill-chosen style, never fully articulates her angst.  Yet, we can imagine them in their earlier lives, seated at their elegantly-arranged dinner tables, designing and executing parties to further their husands' careers, painfully aware that genuine conversations (like those savored with their professors in the Seven Sister Colleges) will never involve them.  Their very lives are in perpetual deferment.  All the elements for significant story telling are here.  Walbert's bon-mots, sprinkled at the end of each chapter ("our hearts worn down by the slow drumming of blood," "we are...a school of fish too old to spawn but desperate to swim back upstream"), indicate a writer with great talent.  Yet, "Our Kind" disappoints.  Its structure, lack of narrative drive and choice of affluent, suburban, east-coast women (far removed from most American women's experiences) doom to the novel to be as satisfying as a furtive tryst with a hired pool boy 
  I think first of all it was whack actors and actresses in this film. I personally think the whole movie was crazy. It did not satisfy me at all. I think it could have been alot of better actors and actresses. Please leave the acting to someone else. 
 I'm looking into returning these things just a few minutes after opening the box. I plugged them into my bookshelf stereo and everything sounded horrid. I'm no audiophile, my bookshelf stereo is a $150 unit, and I'm pleased with it.   I don't expect bass out of these ceiling speakers, but I honestly had a hard time getting any sound out of them at frequencies lower than 1000 Hz.  I had to put my ear inches from this speaker to tell that it was on at lower than 300 Hz, and I noticed serious attenuation of sound until well over 1000 Hz.  It sounded like I was only getting about half the sound out at 600 Hz.  It seemed to keep up just decently above 2000 Hz, though I didn't test too much at the high end. The advertised range for these speakers is clearly very far off. I don't think that this problem could be fixed with a sub woofer.  These speakers simply suck.  Even at $15 apiece.  methodology: I used the program "NCH tone generator" to play specific frequencies through my PC into the stereo and out to my speakers.  Left to one of my bookshelf speakers, also 5.25", right for one of these audiosource ceiling speakers.  By switching the balance back and forth on the stereo to play either my bookshelf speaker or this new one, I could detect a very serious volume drop at all frequencies below 1 kHz, getting worse as it got lower, and almost complete silence below 300 Hz.  
 This movie's plot deals with a no-good wannabe rock star (Jack Black, wildly overacting as usual) suddenly and by mistake taking the job of substitute teacher at a posh school (right, things like this happen all the time), and using it to teach rock music to his students (who are around 9). Most of the music is from the early 70s, so probably not even the children's parents were born when this music was made. I think the rock of that era is wildly overrated by people who happened to be in their teens at that time (it reminds me of another poor movie, Velvet Goldmine, where glam rock, a marginal movement if there was one, was treated as a major artistic achievement, a la par with Oscar Wilde!). And shouldn't each generation choose the music it wishes to be represented with? 
 This was my first download of this type and also my last.  I did get it to play with my desktop where I downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare.  There are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless.  The machines keep freezing up.  The idea is nice but the technology isn't there yet 
 I admit I found the left behind series fascinating at the beginning, but I've noticed a steady decline in the quality of writing in the last few installments books, and a slow homogenization of all the "Trib Saints," into a single character. Absent are the somewhat strong individuals from the earlier books. Instead Rayford and Buck are virtually interchangeable (only Buck cries more). Chloe the super-mom who somehow manages to run an international co-op (along with other stay-at-home moms), from a burned-out skyscraper is an irritating sanctimonious pest, worse still is the transformation of Rayford who has become a one-man Rambo. Ben Judah seems to have become a somewhat disturbing cult-like figure of worship for post trib Christians. Are we honestly expected to believe Ben Judah is the only one who can read and interpret Bible prophecy?  I used to love these books, but I admit, I am tired of most of the main characters. The characters are all egotistical, self-righteous and sanctimonious. They show no compassion for the sufferers who are taking the mark, and even seem to take a certain glee in baiting Carpathianists and unbelievers.  Carpathia himself has become a buffoon. A cartoon villain about as scary as any villain on a Saturday morning cartoon. While I liked the series, the authors were at their best when the Trib force were a 'small group' out to defend Christianity from the anti-christ. In the Mark, they are clearly running the show. Ridiculous.  2 Stars. 
 Many reviewers compared this novel to Jurassic Park, saying it was a better book than Crichton's. What absurdity. I am not saying that JP is an awesome book, but it was far better than Tyrannosaur Canyon.  Tyrannosaur Canyon is a fairly intriguing story, but poorly executed and VERY poorly ended. It's as though Preston suddenly realized that he was going to have to get his characters out of the predicament he had put them in, and didn't know how to do it. The ending is too fast, too unlikely and too unrealistic.  The book closes with a theistic comment by one of the characters, which I believe is Preston's way of attempting to belong to both camps, having his science AND being religious.  Overall, I had high hopes for this book and I am sorry to say that in the last 100 pages, I was greatly let down  
 This book is beautifully illustrated but not for the average upper elementary age child. The are lots of long and unusual words that will prove frustrating to the average 4th & 5th grader.  It may work well for a read-aloud, but the momentum of the story will be lost by the time you stop and explain the meaning of so many words.  Considering the vocabulary, a high school student could easily enjoy and learn about creative writing from this book 
 i adore le creuset, but this tea kettle was a monumental disappointment. as other reviewers have noted, it rusted within months of purchasing it. (however, i admittedly had no problems with burns from the handle or removing the whistle to pour.) i can't imagine what a person would need to do in order to prevent the rusting, aside from never actually using the kettle. i was seriously let down by this purchase, since it looked so beautiful but ended up being so useless 
 As an avid listener of the mad dog's radio program, I really wanted to read his book.  After all, he plugged it at every possible moment on air for three months.  It must be good, right?  Not really.  This book is not for the hard core sports fan.  At the same time, I can't imagine a casual sports fan picking it up either.  At every turn of the page there was one big problem - no depth.  There was no subject that grabbed a hold of me and consequently, I found the book boring.    Too much SF Giants and NY Yankees.  He had no thoughts that made me even remotely  interested.  How would mad dog change the NHL?  Everyone knows the dog doesn't even watch the NHL!  Not even in the playoffs.  Get rid of the blue line!  Why didn't I think of that?  I was really looking for the fire that makes his radio show special.  Maybe all of those years being bored having to listen to Mike have finally taken their toll.  About the only chapter I found interesting was the one where he recommends his favorite sports books.  I plan on reading the ones on his list that I missed.   I doubt this book will make anyone's list.  Sorry Doggie 
 (What do Holly Hunter and Burt Reynolds have in common?)  Just another flick about a gal who falls for an abuser, this time with the gimicks of a waterlogged piano and exotic New Zealand Maori.   The tribe had it right, though, ignore these two losers and stick with the trees 
 I bought this for two reasons: because I wanted to learn about LBOs, and because I had heard that the journalism was good, and was hoping for something like 'The Right Stuff'.  The cover of my copy blurbed 'unflawed' writing, and 'all the suspense of a first-rate thriller'.  The last is true only if your expectations of a first-rate thriller reach no higher than Michael Crichton.  The writing is a plodding 'you are there' journalism-school pastiche of the New Yorker: Gulfstreams are sleak, CEOs are silver maned, side-kicks are bantams, lawyers look like they model for GQ, etc. Investment bankers bark, curse, are struck by inspiration, work off grudges and wave their lingams around at the sort of comic book level Stan Lee would scorn.  I finally realised, after slogging through the first 200 pages or so, that 'Barbarians at the Gate' is, in large part, essentially porn for aspirational middle managers.  There is no-one in this book whom I would want to know, unless I were a sociologist.  But I don't even trust the sociology, because the psychology is so superficial.  I did learn something about the process of LBOs, and for that a star is in order.  I didn't particularly enjoy learning it. 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 I purchased this item for my daughter through the military exchange based on the connectivity options it offered.  The item came in well packaged in a double box with QA stickers across the opening seemingly indicating that the QC department check it out before shipping.  First of all it appeared that the item had been previously used.  The batteries for the remote where nowhere to be found, there was a quick start guide that seemed to have been crumpled into cellophane.  The unit is made of thin plastic and comes with adpaters to accomodate varying iPods.  Once the unit was connected to the speakers and power my daughter inserted her iPod and immediately started playing music.  The sound is below average and there is no equalizaiton or tone controls to adjust it. Next up was the radio.  FM Reception was fair, apparently it comes with a loop atenna for AM but that was also missing so I didn't test AM.  Next up the CD, first it was an MP3 CD, no luck, a copied CD and regular CD failed as well. There are more sources that can be used, i.e. various memory cards but I had seen enough. It's now packaged and ready to be returned.  Stay away from this one. 
 this is by the numbers film making,and as such has no place in the lonesome dove story. with few of the origanl cast back it falls to other actors to take up the parts ,and yes jon voight is a good actor but he can't hold a candle to tommy lee jones and his turn as call. all in all this one misses the mark!!! 
 Enough takes the formulaic made-for TV battered woman story and actually makes a big screen movie sillier than its cheesy small screen counterparts. Another entry into pseudo-feminist category, Enough is a hypocritical movie that preaches empowerment but constantly shows its heroine being objectified and degraded. I hope by reading this review you'll avoid this horrible movie. Enough follows Slim, a waitress working at a Seattle Diner. (Strange she won't identify herself with her real name but objectifies herself by calling herself a shape) We never learn about Slim or her goals in life, she's just a beautiful woman in need of rescuing from her dead-end job. At work She meets up with a Mitch, a handsome rich customer. He woos her; after only minutes of screen time they're in love. Her unassuming "Nice Guy(tm)" boss warns her that Mitch bet him that he could get her into bed. He has the hots for her, too but Mr. Insecure doesn't say anything outside of that passive-aggressive(tm) warning. Despite OBVIOUS WARNING SIGNS about Mitch's CHARACTER Slim continues dating him. Golddigger is just happy to have a rich man sweep her off her feet and save her. So Slim marries Mitch Charming and he decides to buy some guy's house just because he can. Oooh. POWER ISSUES. They have a child, but he won't let her hold her after giving BIRTH to her. Oooh. CONTROL ISSUES. Slim, distracted by Mitch's money can't see BIG RED FLAGS in front of her. It's not until five years later when she gets a call from another woman that she learns he's cheating on her. Instead of quietly taking money out of the joint account, and filing the divorce papers THEN, she confronts him. This leads to Mitch becoming abusive although he's never displayed this behavior previously. Psychology books say batterers have a PATTERN of behavior with women they date, but this movie follows Bizarro logic. He beats Slim down and slaps the kid around for good measure so we can hate him. Slim goes to the cops with a huge bruise on her face but decides to NOT have him arrested or take out a restraining order, fearing he'll take her daughter. She actually believes the malarkey a desk sergeant tells her about the legal system instead of consulting an attorney. Scared, she makes a run for it in the night. But Mitch thwarts her escape plans. After another beatdown, he menaces her adoptive Dad and friend with a gun saying they're trespassing. When she tries another run for it, he freezes her financial assets. So with borrowed money, Slim takes her daughter to a motel. There, Mitch makes a threatening call saying he's everywhere. You'd think after being beaten TWICE she'd keep a tape recorder on hand to record moments like this for EVIDENCE. Making TERRORISTIC THREATS over the phone is a FELONY. Mitch breaks open the hotel door and Slim has to escape. They head up to Seattle where her "Nice Guy(tm)" friend lets them stay with him and puts his passive(tm) moves on her. Cop friends of Mitch pose as FBI. They rough him up, knock down stuff and cut up a sofa. Stupid Mitch doesn't know that "Nice Guy(tm)" would be a WITNESS and these cops would be facing charges from IAB and FBI because Mitch's pockets aren't fat enough to protect them from FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS CHARGES. Yes, Mitch here was STUPID enough to cross STATE LINES to commit his crimes. But Slim never keeps a RECORD of these incidents for EVIDENCE. She goes to real dad in San Fran for help, but gets none. You'd THINK she'd go to a library and study those wonderful Federal and state laws on the books and would be preparing her case with prosecutors. Not wanting to endanger her friends, Slim heads to another city. Detroit, Orlando, they all somehow look Like San Francisco in this movie. Turns out Mitch has friends even in THIS city to help him do his dirty work. Mitch may be a rich, real estate guy, but I don't think anyone is THIS well connected. He coincidentally knows cops in EVERY city Slim goes to? Come on. The cop he enlists to help him is aware that he's committing a crime, but follows orders. Mitch makes more terroristic threats over the phone that Slim isn't smart enough to record for EVIDENCE. This leads to a silly car chase where Slim is SMART ENOUGH TO EVADE HIM ON ROADS SHE KNOWS BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH TO CALL 911 DURING THE CHASE. Terrified, Slim heads back to San Francisco. Dad now decides to help out with his money and connections. Under Daddy's protection, Slim decides to FINALLY get legal advice from an attorney. She also decides to become "empowered" by training to kick Mitch's butt. I'd rather see her train to kick his butt in court with all the evidence shown throughout the movie, but she decides two wrongs will make right. Committing First-degree murder is far more satisfying to her than seeing Mitch and his colleagues go to prison. Final act, Slim breaks into Mitch's house. She plants signal jammers and shuts out the lights. "Empowered" in her belly baring cleavage-exposing black spandex outfit she prepares to confront him. She throws down with Mitch in one of the stupidest fight scenes ever filmed. It's never smart for a woman to take a man on in a fistfight because: A MAN IS EIGHT TIMES STRONGER IN HIS UPPER BODY THAN A WOMAN. He could have KILLED Slim with ONE PUNCH. It happens all the time in real life. Seriously. But following the Bizarro logic of this movie, Slim not only beats the crap out of the s Mitch, she KILLS him. After committing murder, (a handwriting expert would have easily figured out her letters were forgeries during the investigation), Slim goes on to live happily ever after with her "Nice Guy(tm)" diner owner friend, not knowing that he's just like man she just murdered. (Read my review of The Last American Virgin to learn why "Nice Guys(tm)" are dangerous.) Like its contemporaries The Rich Man's Wife, Gang of Roses, and Catwoman in the Pseudo Feminist genre, Enough makes a mockery of feminism with its sexist message of "empowerment." The wrongheaded ideas in this movie tell women to overcome domestic violence with violence, not seek counseling to deal with the emotional trauma or plan a legal strategy. It's interesting to note like in those other mentioned movies, the more "empowered" Slim becomes, the less clothing she wears. We never get to see Slim's face during the movie, only her body parts. This segmenting of her body takes away from her humanity and prevents us from connecting with her emotionally. Production values on this movie are not "Enough" considering the talent. The poorly written screenplay has dialogue that comes from the first draft of a Learning Annex student. Scenes don't transition into each other smoothly leading to a disjointed uneven story. Plain and simple, the acting is downright wretched in this movie. Jennifer Lopez is horrible in the role of Slim. She plays her character with no emotion in most scenes and is over the top in others. Billy Campbell is ridiculous to watch as the batterer. He is a cartoon character who gets more over the top with each scene.  Don't get "Enough" at all. Pick up the far superior Sleeping with the Enemy.  
 I can't think about any other explanation for this silly, stupid thriller if you want to call it that. I can't believe that the writer is doing so badly. I am most certainly disappointed with this book. In the last couple of years, I think he had lost his steam. Plus, why does he have to come up with 15 books or so a year? Why does he not read his own book before he sends it to the publisher? It's time for me to move on to another writer....  I would advice readers to not to read this book 
 I was excited to find this book and enjoyed it as much as the other reviewers seemed to--until several chapters into it the author began making gratuitous, snide political remarks. I ignored the first of them, but they soon became so distracting I put the book aside in disgust. If I had wanted to read political commentary, that's what I would have bought. I would have accepted her broad interpretation of what comprises a "Quirky History" had she not used it as a platform for hurling insults. Her editor, if she had one, should have striken them out. 
 As a complete newbie to XML this was a good starter.  As I got deeper into XML I found several mistakes/deficiencies in the book, and sometimes the author just flat out seemed to not know what he was talking about.  For instance, the claim on page 86 that (#CDATA) is a valid DTD element content definition is flat out wrong.  His description of Schema element declarations (pp. 114-115) teaches that using globals/refs is the only way to define complex elements, and is inappropriate for his example.  He makes no mention of globals at all, leaving the reader confused.  I have ceased to trust this book as a valid source of XML information 
 It's a bad idea to create a character-driven sci-fi when your characters are this annoying.  The majority of Children of the Mind consists of inane dialogue between characters that are impossible to care about.  The characters are so one-dimensional and predictable that you already know what they'll say before they say it.  Peter says nothing except smart alecky remarks, Val spends the whole book whining loudly about not being a real person, Novinha is as crazy and hard-headed as she's been for the last two books, and Ender spouts off a bunch of trite, up-with-people garbage every chance he gets.  Somehow, Card even managed to make Jane more irritating than my ex-girlfriend during PMS.  The only decent characters in this book are Miro and Wang Mu, and they aren't nearly enough to save the story.  I admit it: I only made it a little over half-way through Children of the Mind.  I couldn't take the dialogue anymore.  That's not to mention the ridiculous plot, which centers on two children warping around the universe, engaging in philosophical discussions with caricatures of Japanese and Polynesian culture, in an attempt to avert a war between species.  If you're that curious to learn how the Ender Quartet concludes, do what I should've done from the beginning: find a plot synopsis somewhere and save yourself the pain of reading this garbage 
 Marlowe is what we opiate addicts refer to as a Burning Man Chipper....someone who cautiously dabbles with the drug and then wears it as a badge of honor. It appears that she ingested just enough heroin over the years to feel some of the paltry effects of first or second time withdrawal. This, apparently, has given her license to expound endlessly on paper about her self-absorbed and very uninteresting life. Reading this book is not unlike attending the first couple of Burning Man festivals a decade ago (white art for white people (I should note that I am white)). If reading idealistically naive and flawed reasoning is what interests you, then skip to the astoundingly moronic "Need" section.   Marlowe's claim to a life of junkie strife is akin to an overweight chain smoker riding a bicycle to the corner store to buy a 5'th of cheap gin and then announcing to the world that she did what Lance Armstrong did with cycling/cancer.   I was a heroin addict for 6 years and I spent an additional 2.5 years in a   methadone program getting clean.    The only way we will beat addiction is through education and accurate information.   Marlowe's book is irresponsible and damaging.  
 The two best essays in this book had been previously published (perhaps in Oprah's magazine?). Most of the rest were shallow, not long-term friendships, and one even sounded like her hook-up of the month. Don't bother 
 I totally agree with the authors' arguments. We do indeed have a class system in the United States, and it really does matter. But my god this is a horrible book. The authors go on and on and on and on and on and on about the same things. This is another one of those books that should have been shortened into a 10 page magazine article. It was so bad that I had to stop reading it half way through.  A much better book is Paul Fussell's somewhat dated "Class: A Guide Through the American Status System" 
 This is not a DVD; this is a paperback book about the movie. Shame on you, Amazon, for trying to fool the public! I'll review the real thing when it finally comes out 
 I began my study of political philosophy with the best - namely Plato - so I suppose that when I began reading Aristotle's The Politics, I was optimistic.  That optimism didn't last.  I find that Aristotle takes many arguments for granted and ignores entirely others that would call into question some of his premises.  Often while reading The Politics, I found his analysis entirely lackluster, and his criticisms of The Republic, Gorgias and Laws (all by Plato) flawed or at least overly simplistic.  It's not that I'm incapable of appreciating the brand of philosophy Aristotle uses, after all I do consider myself more or less a realist.  But rather I did find it lacking of vision and insight.  Aristotle focuses on such parochial matters such as classifications of constitutions and mastery over slaves in the household versus statesmanship in the nation, that it never moved me or left me in deeply pensive state.  Ultimately, if you want to be truly inspired - read Plato, not Aristotle 
 I'm a fan of NCIS, but living in australia means that the episodes and dvd's area released months behind those in the USA.  Why is this only available to those in the USA?      
 John R. Barry (another Digital Communications textbook author) first introduced me to this text.  And Mr. Barry, as with many com. theory persons I've met since (GTRI in Atlanta, GA; MITRE along around the Boston area of MA; Northrup in El Segundo, CA; Intersil in Palm Bay/Melbourne, FL) actually use this book to justify their values and beliefs.  Essentially, it's their Bible.  The only problem is that the values and beliefs in Proakis, especially from an engineering perspective, are very third rate.  Trying to use this text in a classroom situation, especially with a third rate engineer as an instructor, is an utter disaster from both an economic and an engineering perspective.  John R. Barry, for example, is a very good baby-sitter and a so-so mathematician (he couldn't be otherwise as a faculty member of Georgia Tech).  But as an engineer, John R. Barry, as with the other followers of Proakis, compares very unfavorably (in fact, I don't consider Barry an engineer; I consider him a phony that should be removed from the ECE faculty of GATECH; the department's economic fortunes would be far better if he were moved into some kind of adjunct English/Mathematics Faculty or just shipped off to some research laboratory without any students to harm [i.e., vampirically mind f--k them and then kindly provide them with werewolfic deliverance (yes, I mean along the lines of the 1972 movie with Jon Voight [Angelina Jolie's Dad] and Burt Reynolds)]...any place where truth/reality aren't so important).  There are far, far better communications engineers out there than John R. Barry [infinitely better to be precise].  And what makes these others better [others meaning real engineers; John R. Barry being a make-believe "engineer"] is not mathematical ability, memorized knowledge, or even rhetorical shrewdness, but rather the difference lies in a faith of facts; something a follower of Proakis never seems to possess or even grasp the possibility.    In fact, the values and beliefs in the Proakis text seem to promulgate not only  Intellectual Abuse, but also a Spiritual sort as well. In a nation (where Steven Pinker, who like Proakis is of Harvard Fame, has noted) that has around 75% of its population esentially believing in the biblical/torah-related account of things, this kind of Spiritual abuse can be very dangerous indeed and lead to serious consequences.  Though it may not be intentional, nevertheless, the values and beliefs of Proakis's text and those of its instructors tend to be extremely spiritually abusive.  These values and these beliefs somehow set up a massive cognative dissonance with many student's own biblical/torah-related values and beliefs.  The result is almost always a broken-spirit.  From an economic perspective, this is bad. Very bad. And it should be stopped by no longer using this text or any like it.  Most of the "engineers" now being "developed" by the followers of Proakis (e.g., John R. Barry) are very analogous to Mid 20th Century Carribean medical school "doctors."  They can say, write, and use a lot of terminology making them useful for billing purposes, i.e. writing up invoices to Insurance/Government agencies.  These "engineers" like those "doctors" don't and probably never will understand the essence of their professions, though because of their training or lack thereof they really think they do.  When in fact, they are utterly clueless "professionals. 
 if you are into dancing, clubs, partying, etc this album is for you if you are into old school r and b this is not for you because these lyrics and tunes have been played before in different variations so its kind of old this is for the new generation who has never heard the old songs 
 This book is full of assumptions and generalizations. Some information is distorted. According to the logic of the writer over 90% of the population should be already dead from "addiction". The writer assumes from the very beggining that any system that is centered around men is addictive and therefore harmful. It is possible, but the writer doesn't make any notes about the  men and women centered systems. The only system that is good is the female system 
 I grabbed this volume from an airport bookshop hoping, as always, for a good read, but as well to learn a bit about a period of Chinese history that I have not read deeply in. Alas, Man's book fails on both levels.  Halfway through and the Mongols are conquering Asia. This part of the book is well written. Exactly why Genghis is the leader and why the Mongols are following him is left unclear. Indeed, after a rough childhood, being kidnapped and escaping Genghis emerges as head of the Mongols? Why? I do not know. The historical record here is probably sparse, but that is no excuse to skip over these years. They are pivotal to explaining why the Mongols emereged. Would the Mongols have emereged under another leader? Or, was it just Genghis?  The final third of the book is spent in Man's quest to find Genghis grave. The lack of any maps to go with the travelogue leaves this section quite confused. Then again, is Genghis's resurrection only to be seen in Man's hiking about the Mongolian woods?  Somewhere there is a good biography of Genghis and the Mongols, but this is certainly not it 
 Darwin's most celebrated nemesis was Samuel Wilberforce, the Archbishop of Canterbury, head of the Anglican Church, who was ridiculed by the young biologist Thomas Henry Huxley, in a now famous debate on evolution held in England back in 1860. It's clearly a bit of an exaggeration to describe former University of California, Berkeley law professor Phillip Johnson as "Darwin's Nemesis", since he has come across more as a lightweight intellectual Luddite in his criticisms of evolutionary biology. I will concede that Phillip Johnson may be a gifted legal scholar and a fine law school teacher (One of his former students may have been a former classmate of mine in Frank McCourt's celebrated Stuyvesant High School creative writing course, who earned some notoriety nearly a decade ago for being one of the two female attorneys responsible for deposing Monica Lewinsky at Special White House Counsel Kenneth Starr's Whitewater Washington, D. C.-based grand jury.). But frankly, that's all the credit I am willing to concede to Professor Johnson, since he has demonstrated repeatedly his gross ignorance of science and understanding how excellent scientific research is done (For example, please see my Amazon.com customer review of his book "Darwin on Trial" which I wrote a few years ago.). Such ignorance has been displayed repeatedly by Johnson in his spirited advocacy of "Intelligent Design", via his "Wedge Strategy", in which he and his colleagues have sought to portray "Intelligent Design" as a viable, credible alternative to the Modern Synthesis Theory of Evolution (Of which its fundamental core was - and still remains - Darwin's Theory of Evolution via Natural Selection; one of the "fathers" of the Modern Synthesis, distinguished Russian-American geneticist Theodosius Dobzhansky once said that "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.". That profound declaration by Dobzhansky still holds true today.). However, "Intelligent Design" is merely the latest manifestation of an old idea stated originally by William Paley back in the 17th Century, which was rejected soundly not by Darwin and his circle of friends, but instead, by "creationist" precursors who were both eminent scientists and clergymen in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. More succinctly, and indeed, more to the point, this apparently "novel" idea was rejected once by scientists hundreds of years ago; but Phillip Johnson, Michael Behe, and William Dembski valiantly wish that it receive ample consideration from the scientific community, even after Judge John Jones' landmark decision in the Kitzmiller vs. Dover Board of Education trial, in which he concluded that Intelligent Design was a religious doctrine masquerading as science (It is posted at:  htttp://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-12-20_kitzmiller_decision.pdf.).  I find the notion of a Festschrift published in honor of Professor Johnson as absurd as a group of Neo-Nazis publishing one to commemorate Adolf Hitler and his hate-filled book "Mein Kampf" (I find this an apt comparison since Johnson and quite a few of his supporters have an ideological world view that is remarkably close to the likes of Adolf Hitler and Osama bin Laden.). If these 19 papers in "Darwin's Nemesis: Phillip Johnson And the Intelligent Design Movement" demonstrate anything, they note only his importance as the movement's spiritual godfather. However, more importantly, these papers demonstrate collectively the lack of good judgement, sloppy logic, and, quite frankly, intellectual dishonesty of "Intelligent Design" supporters. There are other,  much better, and intellectually honest, books on this issue, such as Robert Pennock's "Tower of Babel" (It has the best historical overview and philosophical rebuttal to "Intelligent Design" that I've read so far.), Kenneth Miller's "Finding Darwin's God (My friend Ken has a brilliant rebuke of the Intelligent Design argument of irreducible complexity.), and Eugenie Scott's "Evolution vs. Creationism" (Her book may be the best introductory textbook on this issue available now.). Don't waste your time thinking of acquiring this book, which is a vapid tribute to Intelligent Design's spiritual godfather; it should have been entitled "When Fools Rush In".  (EDITORIAL NOTE: I was tempted to ignore ad hominenm attacks masquerading as comments listed below, but will note that these remarks are exactly what you'd expect from Intellectual Luddites. 
 We loved "One Hundred Hungry Ants", written and illustrated by the same team, but "A Remainder of One" is flawed by having language that is more advanced than the mathematical skill it is intended to teach. I would recommend it for a child who is advanced enough in language to have no problems with the meanings of words such as "former", and "infantry", and yet slow enough in math to need the lesson that 25 leaves a remainder of one when divided by 2, 3, or 4, but not 5. I spent more time explaining to my six-year-old child that the sergeant is Joe's boss, and that "former" means what he used to be but no longer is, than I spent on reading the book! The attractive block-print illustrations lack the clever jokes of those found in "One Hundred Hungry Ants", as well 
 Very little new info. Other books also keep repeating same thing. TPS From an Industrial Eng' Viewpoint and SMED are the only two needed. Everything else is repetition 
 After reading his last few book with "co-authors" I wonder if he is even writing at all or are all the sub-par novels being churned out under his name coming straight from the "co-author". I have been a fan of Mr. Patterson since my first Alex Cross novel almost 10 years ago. While I still enjoy the Cross books, I find them more and more out of character as each new book comes out. Alex-vs- the vampire cult??? Kyle Craig a serial killer??? Alex joins the FBI??? Give me a break. I can only hope from the description of Cross X the series jumps back over the shark and gets back the glory it deserves 
 This movie may have had potential but they blew it with the long drawn out plot.  It is rather boring and seems to have just been made to put forth a political agenda rather than entertain.  
 The story is incomplete and confusing. There are considerable gaps without a parent, adult or smart kid adding additional explanations as the story goes along. If you haven't seen the film you would find yourself scratching your head. Shame on Pixar and Disney for allowing such a poorly written book to be published. If your kid doesn't read, the pictures, frames right out of the cartoon, are great. (The two stars are for the pictures.) But, where were the editors? Is the assumption that kids don't read anyway, so who's going to notice? Well anyway, here's to the illiterates: the one's who call themselves editors and the one's they are cultivating 
 My 15 month old daughter received this as a gift, and I have to admit she loves it, but it has nothing to do with the product design. She would love any toy shopping cart at this stage. She just loves pretend cooking, eating, and feeding her baby doll.   This toy is so shoddily made it's laughable. Some of the included foods to put in the cart are actually just cardboard boxes that wind up torn and in the garbage within the first 48 hours. The cart basket is too small, the baby gets stuck in the seat, and my daughter gets frustrated when parts of the cart fall off as she plays. It's not going to last long. The best parts are the little milk carton and the banana.  Check out other shopping cart toys (little tykes or small world toys).  We bought her a set of wooden fruit (melissa and doug). When this shopping cart dies, we'll buy her a sturdy one and add more wooden food toys (there are some excellent sets available). My advice is skip this one and buy your child something better the first time around 
 Wired Magazine has proven to me something it had never even occurred to me to imagine: That there is a level of cynical, style-whoring, inaccurate, myopic snarkiness that goes beyond merely "trading substance for style." Wired is consistently behind the curve these days, but that doesn't stop the publication from spinning every article like a golden truth you were too lame to know. In articles about controversial subjects, one side is routinely saddled with straw man arguments that are so blatant and artless that I find them offensive even when I disagree with the parties who have been set up for a fall. Just as often, features which don't discuss a contentious topic still have an edge to them, making fun of a person, group, or idea in a way that isn't enlightening or even humorous, let alone warranted by the subject matter. Generally, Wired is as mean-spirited as it is self-congratulatory. This attitude appeals primarily to the demographic of tech wonks and IT industry tourists professionally and personally deflated by the bubble burst, desperately trying to assert their relevance and relive their high-flying, know-it-all glory. Any content is easily outweighed by the sheer volume of half-truths, shoddy reasoning, and straight-up falsehoods which could easily be revealed and corrected by a casual investigation of the subjects treated in pages choked between high gloss, Yuppie/GenXer-targeted corporate mind-poison (advertising). Isn't the world of technology interesting and magical enough without mixing the spin, double-talk, and factual misrepresentation of a presidential debate with the impotent, absurd bravado of Battle Bot pre-match trash talk? People know little enough about how tech rules the world and how it can, quite plausibly, save it. This magazine could evangelize for technology's promise and educate about its current and future potential. Instead it concentrates on one-shots written in a style that passes for "hip" that forwards an attitude rather than a message, with an emphasis on sensationalism over accuracy, having more in common with advertising than edification 
 Reading about statistics in this manner- the language, crammed text, etc. is a surefire narcotic, if that's what you want. It's heavy on quantitative research and methods- and tries a little too hard to pack it all in. You might use it as a reference but realize that you will probably get a headache from reading more that 5 pages in a sitting 
 If this album had "Desperately" on it from "Stick It To Ya", I would've bought it in a second.  That's the best song on that album, a hidden gem that got a small amount of airplay nonetheless.  And with 8 tunes coming from that album (as well as 8 from its follow up "The Wild Life"), you would've thunk that "Desperately" would've made the cut over ho-hum songs like "She Wants More" or "You Are The One".  As such, skip this one, the songs from "The Wild Life" aren't that great anyway.  Get "Stick It To Ya" instead, it's a better best-of Slaughter collection than this one 
 I saw the picture for the 1997 version (green and black)as I needed it for school, so naturally I ordered it.  To my severe dissappointment I received the 1996 version with a burgundy and blue cover.  This is frustrating when you think your getting something your not.  
 This is a book in the genre of Mein Kampf and The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.  An unapologetic smashmouth racist tome that revels and celebrates hatred and fear and is sure to provide supremacist groups with a wonderful volume to treasure and keep on the shelf.  I feel sad when I see that this book will clearly be used to indoctrinate and "teach" people how to hate and fear other people.  Raspail's central thesis is that white people should be nervous because there are a lot of non-white less "desirable" people out there who are coming to peacefully take over their fat, rich lands.  He uses every negative, racist term to describe nonwhites calling them: "turd eaters" and emitting foul stenches etc. etc.  In short, everyone other than whites is a subhuman animal that could be tolerated as long as it doesn't come too near.   The book is a mean spirited, paranoiac Malthusian nightmare of being over-run by "the other" (where the other is a bunch of starving Indians on a convoy).  Fear pervades every page of this book and one finds one actually pitying the revoltingly racist Mr. Raspail simply because of the fever pitched fear that must course through him.    Having read Raspail's odious and despicable work, I find myself wonder what would happen if an ice age descended on Europe and obliterated "Western Civilization" there. How would the North Africans react to flotillas of poor, emaciated Europeans showing up on their relatively warmer shores ?  Would they adopt the attitude that Raspail longs for and attack them or....?  It's clear that Raspail is an imaginative writer. What worries me is the extent to which his work will be used to excuse, shelter, justify and defend pure murderous evil.  
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
 Not bad. The three feet on the bottom just makes the whole thing unstable and does not help to stabilize the holder. It's ok for the basement or utility room, but if I had to choose again, I wouldn't buy it 
 I don't know why it won the National Book Award.  This book is very slow, & very boring.  Where is the action?  I forced myself to finish it 
      Three kids whose parents have abandoned them are put at a place called Whitegates.  They escape and go down river to the worst place you could ever imagine.  This is where they meet the grateful Heaven Eye's.  They also met heaven Eye's grandpa who is a little weird and scary. The scariest things happen in the Black Middens.  They have to try and find out the mystery of the Black Middens, Heaven Eye's, and grandpa      The dislikes I had about the book was every time someone had said something David would write he said, she said.  He would never replace said with yelled or screamed or anything.  I didn't really like the end of the book that much.  I thought the book was a little pointless.  The ending didn't really have a reason behind it.      I would recommend this book to people who are into books about people getting stuck somewhere.  Also I would recommend this book to people who look at the positives in life.  
 We purchased our DVD player in June 2005 from HH Gregg for $140.  By December the screen would sometimes turn white so that we couldn't see the picture.  Within a few months the screen stayed white all of the time, so that now we cannot play dvds at all.  Audiovox wants $94 to fix it.  I'm sure thats the cost of replacing it. The sound quality was never great, but we endured it.  What a complete waste of money and theres no way I'm sending Audiovox another $100 for this or any other product. 
 I find books like this help you with opening remarks, like simple one-liner ice breakers. OK, so they feed you some lines and then what are you supposed to talk about? If you don't know many people at the event, it's hard to come up with something interesting that won't end with you red-faced, or with your foot firmly in your mouth. I find online knowledge services like Agogus.com are very helpful in this respect, more that these kinds of books. I have more confidence to start a conversation, now that I have a wide knowledge of all kinds of topics. It's even fun to go to holiday parties, not a pain like it used to be. 
 Rather bleak play with a pessimistic storyline.  Mediocre plot, mediocre characterization.  I don't recommed it 
 Here is another self-help book that didn't need to be written. The useful information could be summerized in a phamplet, if so much - the cover would be sufficient. Why this writing style is so popular is beyond my comprehension (maybe because people like me keep picking them up...AHHH!!!). The use of filler "stories" are quite uneccessary if the author has something unique or interesting to say, but in most of these books it is just a rehash of the same basic information. If this is the first of this type of book you are reading you may find some of it interesting and useful, but that is being generous, but, if you have read any other self-help book remotely similar, don't even waste your time 
 Let me join the other reviewers in panning this book. The color illustrations are nice (compared to the Adobe manuals, which have gotten thin and have no color), but that's about it. The details just aren't there. For example, the author will show you the star tool, and talk about using its dialog box to set options, but doesn't mention using the Command (PC:ctrl) or Option (PC:alt) keys with this tool, nor what they do. So not only does it read a bit like a manual, but it's an incomplete manual. Beyond that, there's not much content -- try Cohen's "Creative Studio" book or Steuer's "Wow!" book, or better yet, get the video training from Total Training 
 The commericial for this doll shows her swimming in water.  Now I wasn't crazy enough to believe that it could actually swim, but I did think the doll could be placed in water.  NOT!!111  My daughter was very disappointed that she couldn't play with it in the bath tub.  Also the dolls singing is annoying, you can't understand what she's saying 
 My 1st grader was assigned this book to read.  She could read the book fine, but the contents is definitely for the older kids.  The book talks about divorce, parents with boyfriends, masacre of Barbies, bras... definitely not appropriate for the younger crowd.  The other problem of course is she can read it fine, but doesn't follow the story because the topics are for more mature kids.  I'm sure there are other books at this same reading level with less mature topics 
 If you watched the movie and remember a few great songs, this is not where you will find them.  "California Dreaming" by The Mamas and the Papas? Nope, not here. "Things In Life" by Dennis Brown (the jukebox song from the bar)? Nope, not here. "What a Difference a Day Makes" by Dinah Washington? You guessed it, not here. But the big kicker that you're going to love the most- that beautiful mezmerizing strings symphony from the opening scenes is here, well sort of- OK, not at all. Actually Fornication in Space is not the song we're talking about- in fact this song was never in the movie at all! Its a cheezy synthesizer *cover* of the symphonic strings piece. You're actually looking for Michael Galasso's "Baroque", and yep, you guessed it, its not here. What a farse. When you consider this Hong Kong import "soundtrack" if you actually want to call it that- consider other HK imports like bronze Rolex watches and you'll get the idea.. 
 The general problem with Arabic texts is that there are not many good options out there. Supplemental books, such as the '201 Verbs', is ok, but it quickly loses the average student who is unfamiliar with what the meaning of the 'jussive' verb form is in English.   I wish there would be a listing of the verbs in English as well.  They are in alphabetical order in Arabic, something that is only of limited help.  The need for better Arabic texts is very high.  An overhaul of this book would be much appreciated 
 I'll keep this brief since you can read many lengthy reviews.  I feel like the characters have lost their voices.  The characters do not grow or change, and are nothing like the warm humans they were in the first books.  Even the main characters are cold archetypes here in these later books.  I keep hoping I'll open a new Goodkind book and it'll be fresh and I will want to know the characters more, but they're just gone.  I tried to start the next book, and it was worse.  Unfortunately, I'm just done with this series.  
 The dictionary is very good and very useful. I absolutely love it.Recommend it.Having said that, the CD- though very good- only shows how greedy and pathologically overcautious this company Longman is. Who in the world came up with the idea of authenticating the cd once a month? Why can't we just punch in a registration number at the time of installation? Wouldn't this give Longman peace of mind and make us - customers - happy? Why can't they take care of this problem? What would take to bring their attention to such an obvious flawed feature? I lost my CD. You know what that means? I lost my money as well. I don't appreciate that Longman. You should have fixed this problem long time ago. One star you're getting because of that. I hope you read reviews 
 Thriller and mystery readers like to guess along with our protagonists when we're reading a story.  We like to look for clues in what we've read to help us unravel the plot, and find out who did it and why the crime was done.  John Grisham cheats us out of that fun.  The villian of this book isn't introduced until there less than 75 pages left, which means that when you get that far, you realize that everything you read before then wasn't valid. To have some red herrings in a thriller is fine, but to have 300 pages of chases and red herrings?  That's bad.  Read another thriller instead of this one, one that plays by the rules 
 When I was a kid, I loved this movie and the TV series.  I was a devoted fan, and built model rockets of the Viper fighter, and dreamed of one day being a starfighter pilot.  So you can imagine that I was very excited about getting this DVD.  Unfortunately, now that I am an adult it simply isn't possible to enjoy it any more.  The storyline is full of holes and every cliche you can think of.  The special effects are cheap.  It's just no fun anymore 
 This book is fine, probably even very good, for those who wish to proof their own day-to-day business correspondence.  However, the treatment of proofing symbols is limited, and the sample markings deviate somewhat from  accepted professional practice.  More of a first intro to some of the very  basic things to look for when proofreading.  No discussion of the  bookmaking process or what editors expect of a professional proofreader 
 Having received a minor in Mathematics in college, I was confident that I could take something of value from this book but I'm afraid that was not the case.  I can't imagine what kind of feeling a person who wasn't as familiar with Math would be left with.  The hypothesis set forth in the book amounts to nothing.  The author doesn't satisfy the needs of the reader.  He leaves them out to dry without finalizing any aspect of his "report."  Neither does he supply the reader with any reasons as to why solving this problem would be useful.  He simply says that there are many reasons, without naming them.  I, personally, cannot think of any good use for the theorem that predicts the frequency of prime numbers.  There may be a good reason though and that's what I wanted from the author.  The last complaint I have is with the superfluous and pointless charts, graphs, tables and diagrams.  They do nothing but confuse the reader more.  The book is well researched.  It paints a nice picture of the history of Mathematics(traced all the way back to the Ancient Greeks) and it clearly defines the progression of the study of prime numbers.  It also provides biographical information on some of the most brilliant mathematicians ever including Gauss and Euler but I don't think that's what the author intended to be the best part of the book.  If you want a historical and biographical account of the study of Mathematics, I'm sure there are better books out there.  This one fails to deliver on the importance and the future of the Riemann Hypothesis 
 Another reader says: <this reader was left to "figure out" where the statistics came from.> That's because half this stuff is made up! Walker is one of the people who started the "Super Bowl Wife  Abuse" myth. She hurts the cause more than help it - like the boy who  cried wolf 
 I have read several books in this genre, and this has to be one of the dullest books on the market that deals with life in Italy.  I've lived in Italy on two occasions for short periods of time and can't help but wonder - if Mr Parks dislikes Italy so much, why is he still there?  He certainly comes across as disliking Italy and Italians.  This has none of the humor or whimsy of other similar books.  Very disappointing.   I should have know better since I also read "Italian Neighbors" and was unimpressed by it 
 These shoes look great on, however are extremely uncomfortable.  They run VERY small in size (I went up 1 1/2 sizes from what I normally wear in SM brand).    I would not recommend them as shoes you would wear for more than an hour at a time because the thong portion cuts into your skin and the arches in the heels are so high that they put alot of pressure on the ball of your foot 
 Ok Ive been Using Proactiv 4 about a year now and i have to say that it did work for me well like 90% with one or two breakouts a month so i was pretty pleased about that. People often asked me what i did cuz my change was drastic, so that was nice.  One night i styed up late and that Murad infomercial came on and it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it and they even compared it to proactiv, so i tough i would give it a try so i ordered it online the next day.  Couple Of Days later i received the package and i was pretty exited so i began to use it and liked the overall feel of it. few days pass by and i wake up one morning with all these little white heads in my upper chin and i was immidiately grossed out but since they said it was normal due to purging i didnt worry much, one week later it got worse and even began breaking out in places i hadnt before like in my forehead. I knew somethign wasnt right so i went online and started reading other custumer reviews and was shocked at the similaruty of thwe problem so i freaked out and decided to stop using it because it got so bad to the point where i didnt wanna be seen and on top of that it became very painful both physically and mentally i becamed sorth of depressed about the situation i sorth of felt like a teen going trough puberty again.   I Have now gone back to proactiv and seen improvement so hopefully within the next couple of weeks it will clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under a rock hahaha. My main advice is to really do ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before 
 I loved the book as a kid and it's too bad they had to ruin it by making such a lame movie out of it. They could have done something much better with the story but instead tried to make it funny to both adults and kids. When will writers learn? Either MAKE IT A GROWNUP MOVIE OR MAKE IT A KIDS MOVIE! It's really hard to do both without kids going "Huh?" and adults going "funny but I can't explain it to the kids." Mike Myers was just UNFUNNY as the cat and his delivery of the jokes was rotten. He's barely funny anyway, (example, Waynes World where Mike is a 40 year old dude playing a teenager..also not funny) why would they put him in this movie? It really comes off like he is trying too hard, it's painful to watch. Jim Carey would have been way funnier as the cat in my opinion. I liked the colorful costumes and houses. Visually it was amazing and captured the look and theme of the book but everything else fell short. The kids acting was pretty good and the ending was funny. It's just too bad they made such a bad choice when casting the Cat. Mike ruined the movie and he was way too over the top. If I never see him 'act' again I would not be upset. The jokes in the movie were way too grown up, kids are smart and sadly a lot of them might actually understand this humor and it sets a bad example. I would not go so far as to say this movie is horrible, it's just not great overall 
 I cannot give this volume a very positive review.  This is a very good book to read on the development of the company and on the internal workings of Goldman Sachs- which is one of the world's great investment banks.  The difficulty arises from  the author's strong bias toward the positive, which is reflected in the subtitle of the work. This bias penetrates the work in all aspects of the operation- culture, people, history, etc.   Yes, it is a strong company, but it has made its share of mistakes, most notably in the book in aligning itself with the "false tycoon" Robert Maxwell and his dealings. The various mistakes made along the way are polished over by the author or ignored entirely.  Again, I would raise my review from two stars to four with the caveat that the reader view the book as part history lesson and part unabashed advertisement while consuming its wisdom.

 When it is all said and done about Clinton's Legacy, Gene Lyons has assured himself a place in the Presidential Library by writing such a book. The book does point out several areas that Clinton haters seldom want to  see or believe. For example, regardless how you feel about Bill, you must  admire his ability to not only survive a sad, sordid and disadvantage  childhood but achieved his goals in education, public service and politics.  He did so on his own initiative, using and abusing close friends who also  did the same to him, and focusing on saying anything at anytime that could  help him at that time. Whitewater was a shady inside financial political  deal, made among many politicians with profiteers when the Saving and Loan  sector was deregulated, not just in Arkansas but throughout the country. It  was denied during the campaign and avoided by a phony accounting report  that was needed in the primaries, but proved to be less than accurate after  Clinton was elected president. On one hand, two of Clinton's friends became  upset when the deal went south and felt Clinton abandoned them when he  became president. Now did those friends feel betrayed by Clinton and wanted  to bring him down as the book points out? The author has made a great case  saying so and I believe him. On the other hand, was it the silence of  others who refused to answer pivotal questions whether such meetings with  Clinton took place? This would lead back to the president when he was a  governor and would show he plotted and scheme with them? No doubt about it,  their silence saved this president. Therefore, in the book Gene Lyons wants  us to believe the former but some facts clearly show an investigation was  needed and reported properly by the media contrary to the author's  CONclusions. Either way, 17 convictions including the Solicitor General's  convictions are facts not fiction. The author has been trying to apologize  and justify Clinton's behavior since the impeachment. In the end, no book  using revisionists history is going to exonerate this president's actions  prior to and during the first four years of his presidency that  accomplished more than people expected. At the same time, no book can  change the fact that president Clinton was able to avoid impeachment for  many acts that even his party said can be punishable after these last four  years of absolutely few accomplishments whatsoever. No friend or enemy of  the Clintons' have been able to help or hurt the Clintons' more so than  themselves as well as this book that lives off of a public's poor memory.  The only problem is, when you view the Clinton presidency even after  Whitewater, it is one few can be proud of and the only fool is the one who  claims it had made up scandals to bring them down. Sorry, they did it all  by themselves and still are doing it, to the dismay of the many who support  them, and frustration of those would destroy them. The book is worth  reading to provide an overall view of the Clintons' but it can't change  history 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I am a high-tech marketing manager and an adjunct professor. From both the real-world business side as well as the academic side, I found this book to have little value. It spends page after page on general issues regarding Internet Marketing, and never gets to anything that could be used or implemented in the business world. Topics are explained without giving specific details as to how to implement the Internet Marketing idea. A very specific example is a description of viral marketing which the author refers to as "Creating a Wave." The short section goes on to say that free media, publicity and word of mouth are important. Of course they are. But how do you get them? I feel sorry for the students that are required to purchase this book. I guess they'll have to learn Internet Marketing on the job. I'm glad I only paid $10 for this book used instead of the $90+ list price 
 Don't waste time if you're looking for an excellent intro text for a business ethics course.  This text has the following virtues: -reasonable overview of normative ethical theory in chapter 2 -short, pithy case studies to motivate problems  The text has the following vices: - it totally ignores libertarianism in the discussion of normative ethics (a significant oversight since it dominates the Western approach to property, contracts and other business issues) -there is a biased inclusion of primary sources.  For example, you'll find an essay in favor of unions but none opposing.  There is an essay criticizing employment at will but none defending it.  There is a defense of prferential treatment in hiring (e.g. affirmative action) but none criticizing it.  There is a quasi-defense of manipulative advertising but none criticizing it. -some of the primary sources are simply poor choices for a business ethics text.  They are either poorly argued or merely tangential to the real issues.  For example, "Buddhist Economics" by Schumacher, "Homosexuality, Prejudice, and Discrimination" by Mohr, "The Place of Non-humans in Environmental Issues" by Singer, etc.  Instead, I recommend the Beauchamp and Bowie anthology 
 I am a Brian Tracy fan, however I was less than impressed with this book. I did not find any of the information to be differant from what he has put in previous books and CD's. It is more like he dummied down the information from other books into 21 small 2-3 page lessons/chapter 
 I could barely make it through to the middle of this book. The author (Shatz) seems to have dedicated his life to anti-zionism... and, okay, so be it. But as a gentile agnostic, I find the idea of collecting writings of jews who detest Israel to be a ploy, as if just because they are Jewish, they know better than the rest of us that it is right to be anti-israel. Yet Shatz writes for the Nation with arrogant, cynical bitterness about Ajami, an Arab who frequently takes on the Arab establishment! Mr. Shatz, if you, a Jew delight in finding other jews who are anti-zionist, then why does it stun you that an Arab might be against Arab nationalism?  Hail a clue taxi. 
 Anthropology entails 3 perspectives: (1) cross-cultural, or looking at other cultures than our own, (2) holistic, or looking at all parts of culture in relation to each other, and (3) relativistic, or looking at each culture as its own standard of values and meaning.  Notice there is no "Christian perspective."  Anthropology is not about judging other cultures, and it is certainly not about changing them.  This book should not be called "Cultural Anthropology."  What it suggests is nothing like anthropology.  It should be called something like "Destroying Other Cultures with Your Culture" or "Destroying Anthropology by Misusing It."  No real anthropologist would read this book, other than to learn about the mind of the true believer 
 A waste of time and money. If you are interested in other people's dreams and love to hear every detail, then this book is for you 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 i HATE this author because her book only described women in their physical tersm. primarily, whether they were a 'dusky beauty' or otherwise, all women are 'plain' in her mind. She is not enlightened at all about the various challenges women face. she is only concerned with how well they cook, clean & please their husbands. she offered hardly any insight into shiite muslim woman's world. i'm disgusted to find out she is has received so much acclaim as a 'feminist', author & professor (her obsession with superficial design elements may allow her to make so-so films but she should not be a well-received author!). She's an air head. Read this book & you'll see exactly 
 Who ever thought you could make a boring book about the tragedy of Sept.11.  Spiegelman's In the Shadow of No Towers is dull as dishwater.  I'm sure he had the best of intentions when he published this book, but there is little if any resonance in this book.  In the last pages there are reprints of Platinum Age comics...WHY.  I guess I'm just too dense to appreciate this book, but I definitely felt nothing after reading this.  I think the good reviews for In the Shadow of No Towers are a mixture of the Emporer's New Clothes syndrome and elitist hype 
 I found the characters stilted and unbelievable.  These are supposed to be "REAL" people? It is just my opinion but my copy goes up for sale today 
 Islam to Israel is very threatening. Remember Israel did not exist until the early 40's and it was given credibility and the credibility was not earned. Islam and Muslims respect those who do not oppress and disallow the peaceful and civilized way of life. Who allowed Jews to re-enter Jerusalem and worship peacefully after 500 years of exile OMAR IBN KHATTAN (khalifa), look it up. While the Roman Catholics did not.The media has been trained and told to sympathize with Israel and the Jews. This is not my opinion but a fact. The media is controlled by dual citizens to America and Israel; they must show loyalty to our country USA. Learn about the history of Zionism, www.jewsnotzionists.org and righteous Jews will tell you about the short history of Israel, not Muslims Arabs or Christians. We do not see the massacre of Genin, look it up and see what Israel did to the Palestinians, murdered kids and women and old men. LOOK!!!! find the truth, are media is not reporting the news the are censored, most media moguls in Hollywood and the media are Zionists, not because i am a racist but because it is true. LOOK!!!! There is a deep and saddened bias in the news and unfortunately for the ignorant is enough. ISLAM teaches respect and reveres the Torah and the Engeel (bible) and teaches to respect all the faiths, but if they oppress and murder and pillage and blatantly disrespect Islam then they fight back, (uncivilized) strapping bombs to themselves, is there a civilized way of killing people. Israel is state sponsoring terrorism and people are turning the other cheek, millions of Muslims in Chechnya and Bosnia have been murdered (genocide and holocaust) and the western media has shunned away, where is the justice, why has not this hypocrite of an author not mention this, he his choosing and deliberately misleading people and not given a truthful fact about Islam and the last Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Moses (peace be upon him is a Muslim) and so is Jesus (peace be upon him) conveying the message of ISLAM (SUBMISSION TO GOD, and in between people have strayed. Post this!!!! 
 This is a terrible book. It is poorly written and extremely predictable. If you are in High School it "might" be a good choice just to pass the time if you are bored to death 
 I found this book covering a very broad range of topics in IS and IT subjects. A good book for a beginer (suggestion: rename to "IS Management For Dummies"). A terrible book for experienced users  searching for specifics. I found the discussion of IS management practices  painfully boring and over simplified with too many definitions. It needs to  cut to the chase. There are far better selections in this price range 
 There were only two chapters in the book that kept my attention. The rest of the book I had to push myself through to read. I felt the characters were strange, yet predictable. This is not the first Oprah book I didn't care for, however it was part of a book club I belonged to, so I gave it my best shot. I felt it was boring 
 This is misleading...not even 5% of the Ruskin masterwork is printed in this book.  
 I read this book because I have an interest in prehistoric sites and wondered what a famous self help guru might have to say about them. I looked forward to a spiritual discussion of these ancient, enigmatic monuments. Unfortunately the book turned out to be more about Mr Peck and less about megaliths. If your idea of fun is reading a long list of complaints about food, hotels and the lack of refuse bins in train stations etc then this is the book for you. His views on Britain are a continual whine about how it is "not like home". When not complaining about breakfasts, the author indulges in long, self indulgent monologues about his family, beliefs, infidelities and smoking. Honest maybe but I ended up feeling very little sympathy for him. When we do get round to talking about prehistoric sites his "insights" are questionable to say the least. I can understand how someone can wax lyrical about a little known dolmen in a field, after all beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However his dismissal of the dramatic and beautiful Pentre Ifan left me speechless. If you want to visit prehistoric sites in Britain please don't use this book as a guide or you will end up missing some truly beautiful places. Just to set the record straight the reason that there weren't any bins in the station is because at the time of his visit, terrorists were planting bombs in them. If the author had stopped complaining for a few minutes he may have found this out for himself. 
 Every summer brought the drive in my in-laws' car from Stockton to Santa Cruz. I was not a California native,only marrying into a California family so I was not familiar with the state's history.I just remember California seeming so vivid and alive.  Joan Didion narrates her family's move west and the intertwined history of the state and her family. Not only do we learn of family, but of the changes in the society. California has always struck me as a restless  state, ever on the move, turning to the next idea or trend. Didion follows her family's history, the eventual erosion of the ties to the land and agriculture and the huge immigrant wave. There are the huge industrial closedowns and the urban sprawl and growth. This is a book for anyone who loves California, but not nearly as revealing about the author nor her roots.  
 I purchased this book specifically because of the "North Carolina" in the title.  However, except for six pages about N. C. frost dates, rain fall and hardiness zones, I've found nothing in this book that is specific to gardening in North Carolina (not to say that it isn't good, basic advice about southern gardening).  I feel cheated 
 Amazon picture shows an original Japanese-produced NP-40 with 3.7V and 710mAh (just like the one I got with my F810). What I got was a Fujifilm-branded Chinese-produced NP-40 with 3.6V and 750 mAh. YES, IT WORKS, but it's just obviously cheaper. Skepticism is a virtue 
 I had a 3 day detention to serve, 90 min's after each school day, so I went to the library originally looking for a book on engenering. I saw this instead, and decided to rent it out.  When I got in the car, I noticed the table of content's had several racial comment's in the front, but I ignored it. After reading a few CH. I couldnt beleive this book, but I kept reading it, cause it was entertaining how much of an idiot Chuck D is. He is the reason some white people have negative veiw's of black people. Because he play's the role of a loser who blaims everything on the same people that put him where he is now. Why not just bite the hand that feed's you? If you are in the black Panther's, are obsessed with Chuck D, or just straight up hate white people I would suggest this book. The real reason I hate this book is I despise anyone who makes racist comment's against anyone at any time, and against any race. I myself am white, and there was 3 race riot's where I grew up, I got stabbed in 5th grade by a black kid my age, and my father was murdered before I was born by a black man... So why don't I just write a book against " My oppressor's ". This book show's that Chuck D is truely not a smart man, just a racist fool, who is no more smart then Flavor Flav. He need's to go back to first grade, and watch more barney, so he can learn to love everyone. But I guess he is just going to get his, ironically like his song " Your gonna get your's ". I can not express in word's how much I hate this book, and I feel ashamed for every buying It takes a nation.. 
 My problem was that these books were missing chunks of pages!  We didn't notice it until book 4 of 6, but 80+ pages were gone!  Now, Amazon was great about replacing the set adn paying for me to return the messed-up set.  This is just a warning to check your boxed set when it gets in for missing chunks of pages!  Of course, the Harry Potter series is great, adn we love having them in paperback 
 This book is full of lies, written by people who have no idea what they are talking about. I would recomend that they actually visit this country before they speak about it 
 I was disappointed with my purchase.   The first two tapes in the series were fine, but when I inserted the 3rd tape into my machine the tape started feeding out the front of the machine.  I checked the tape and the wheels or sprockets they were wound on were loose and free floating inside the plastic casing.  I, then examined the other remaining cassettes and 4 of the 8 had the same problem.  I wonder if these products were seconds or something?  I would not order from this vendor again because it could have ruined my machine and because it is a hassle to have to return merchandise in today's busy work world.  
 Don't get me wrong Meatloaf fans.  I have nothing personal against you, your music, or the artist who performs it.  I'm sure Mr. Loaf is a fine, outstanding citizen that anybody would admire in person, but as for the style of music he performs?  Attrocious!  These bombastic, over the top, pseudo opera epics sound more like a Broadway musical than rock n roll.  The songs are boring and tell long winded stories with involved plots.  The production is over the top and bombastic.  Meatloaf took everything to the extreme and the result was one of the most pretentious albums ever made.  
 I have loved this series from the beginning - great characters, fun stories, thrills and romance.  Very light, quick reads that are great entertainment.  This story was awful.  There were two mysteries.  One was wrapped up so quickly it was very unrewarding, and the other was so convoluted I didn't even get it.    A comment was made that one person, when convicted, wouldn't be around to hurt anyone any more. But this person wasn't even the perp for the big mystery.  And the epilogue? WHO was that person?  And how did they figure it out?  Too many holes for an otherwise easy read.    Finally, the characterization was off.  The normal comraderie between the girls was missing.  I felt no love from the original three for Yuki, in spite of her storyline.  If there's a sixth story, I hope it brings back some of the magic from the earlier books.  I'm giving this book two stars only because these characters are like old friends.  If I had just picked up the series with this book, it would be a one.  Sorry James 
 I cannot give this volume a very positive review.  This is a very good book to read on the development of the company and on the internal workings of Goldman Sachs- which is one of the world's great investment banks.  The difficulty arises from  the author's strong bias toward the positive, which is reflected in the subtitle of the work. This bias penetrates the work in all aspects of the operation- culture, people, history, etc.   Yes, it is a strong company, but it has made its share of mistakes, most notably in the book in aligning itself with the "false tycoon" Robert Maxwell and his dealings. The various mistakes made along the way are polished over by the author or ignored entirely.  Again, I would raise my review from two stars to four with the caveat that the reader view the book as part history lesson and part unabashed advertisement while consuming its wisdom.

 I stopped reading after 150 pages. There are three interwoven tales. The first of a serial murderer who wanders around trying to evade a supernatural monster, and his half-crazy ex-wife who seems to get off on the prospect of being killed. The second of a high-tech pirate ship that wanders around, kills a few people, tries to find out something about a mysterious device. The third about two men who only seem to wander around aimlessly. And the prose, which initially felt interesting, seems to wander around aimlessly, too. A pity, since a nice SF world shines through 
 While I thought that Ms. Warner's points were accurate, she spends the entire book going over and over the same points until one is simply tired of hearing about the problem with no idea how to escape it. I agree that many of today's famalies are over-scheduled and spending way too much time at daily multiple activities rather than living. This book points out a problem but does nothing to suggest how to combat it.   One quote from the book I found offensive was on pg. 25, "I had no qualms about eliminating those activities I found needlessly boring or stupid-like the lap-sit story hour at the nearby American Library..." As a children's librarian I guess I took this harder than others would. I agree that many activities could and should be scaled back and or cut, but perhaps Ms. Warner fails to understand that story hour is an effort to teach parents how to share books at home with kids. Of all the things to cut it is my hope people will opt out of soccer for a 3 year old and take a trip to the library once in a while. 
 A. S. Byatt's work can be excellent. Her short stories are really marvelous, and "Possession" was a wonder - full of life and characters and plot. In the series that is capped by this novel, I continue to find "The Virgin in the Garden" an outstanding work and "Still Life" quite remarkable. However, "A Whistling Woman" is too large, it covers too many topics, too much history and too much science (done without any spirit) and too many stories. The period explored by the novel certainly encompassed all these things, but why did the novel try to do the same. Should not the novelist sift through and bring forth something that crystallizes the period, rather than load the reader with details and leave us wondering at the end why we plowed through such a "big" book only to find a clueless, pregnant Frederica. The work loses focus, flattens characters and in the end finishes rather lamely - dead characters either we hardly knew or from whom we expected more; live characters who have disappeared into clichs, and romances that even the author seems reluctant to accept. I have to admit, the energy of the 60s does seem to have ended in pregnant 70s girls in Laura Ashley dresses, but I do think that Byatt should have left this novel to sit for awhile, and come back to it after a little reflection, crafting a finer piece, which her readers deserve. Let's hope now that Byatt has the series behind her, she will be freed to write a more wonderful work 
 This coffee maker is not up to the usual Krups standard.  The latch to open the coffee filter doesn't always work.  Everything on this machine looks and feels cheap-plastic.  Also, why does Krups require you to purchase a new permanent filter with every purchase?  Older model filters never fit in the newer models.  If you fill the water even slightly over the 10 cup line (yes the instructions tell you not to) you WILL burn yourself when you take the pot out.  The hot coffee will run right over the top of the carafe and onto the handle.  I was always a loyal Krups customer, but will rethink my position on that when making my next appliance purchase 
 This is sad, dirty & depressing tale. Although Kate Christensen writes beautifully, I couldn't have cared less about this pathetic character.  It lacks wit and humor and the reviewers who said "it's laugh out loud" funny are the kind of people who laugh at car wrecks. Any cleverness or wit is lost in the dark tone that overrides the entire story.  Skip it 
 The Complete Idiot's Guide to Lost Civilizations is just that....a guide for complete idiots.  Don't get me wrong, I purchased this book looking for an easy to understand, concise guide to lost civilizations; I wanted something to read to get a basic understanding before tackling more scholarly works.  I needed a framework.  The format of this book seems wonderful at that.  Easy and fun to read, I would recommend this book if it were not for the gross factual errors.  I am not an expert in lost civilizations, but after reading a text on both Greece and Rome, I found Ryan's book to be riddled with errors in these two sections, my favorite being the name of the first Ceasar....whose name happens to be Julius.  Ryan says its Octavian...well, he's almost right.  He's the second, taking the reigns from his adopted father Julius. This fact is not up for contention or debate; it's simply a fact..as is the information he got wrong about Cleopatra, Claudius, Nero, the five good emperors....Linear B. Since my knowledge is only basic and only covering two sections, I can only wonder at the misinformation piled into the rest of the book. Today I use this book as a way to study the ancient civilizations I have read about--by looking for errors in this book.  If you are looking for a concise history of lost civilizations,and want to be confident in the accurateness of your newly found knowledge--look elsewhere 
 While the story is good and well done, the quality of the DVD itself was disappointing.  Certainly offered no sharpness as one expects of digital technology.  Also the scenes changed suddenly as though the whole thing was done from a Video tape of the production with the advertising cut out.  Not good to watch at all.  We were expecting the customary quality that one associates with DVD 
 I didn't get 20 pages into this book before I said ENOUGH ALREADY GET TO THE PART WITH THE WHALES.  Sheesh.  Maybe the ending is good.  Maybe Ishmael and the whale become lifelong friends and live happily ever after.  I do not know because Mr. Melville wont stop rambling on and get to the POINT.  There is a nice picture of a whale on the cover of my copy anyway so that rates this book as TWO STARS.  The rest is mostly junk.  Back to the drawing board 
 This CD on the Erato label has many great selections including the rare Konzertstuck for hour horns in orchestra.  However, the performers play with too much vibrato, particularly on the pieces from the classical era.  Even though the collection includes the incredible Konzertstuck, it is played most poorly, with a very obvious crack on the high E.  If you want an alternate recording of the Konzertstuck, there is a phenomenal one with Gerard Schwarz and the Seattle Symphony on the Delos label.  If it is the Mozart concerti you want, I suggest the classic Dennis Brain recordings.  If you really enjoy the sound of vibrato on a horn, then get this CD.  You will not find horns that play with more vibrato than these guys 
 Don't buy this camera really.  I had it for a month and was taking good care of it.  I was initially thrilled.  The LCD screen got damaged -- no I didn't drop it.  The treatment from customer service was so poor and disturbing that I was shocked. The customer service representative actually questioned my integrity and proceed to talk to me as if I were an idiot.  A $181 repair bill for a $300 camera is not feasible.  It was a great camera at first, but I demand better treatment and respect from the company.  Look for a better camera, look on the web for comments on their customer service and don't buy this camera.  I had read very negative things about Sony but didn't think they applied -- they really are true.  I don't like being called a liar by anyone especially when I am the customer.  The camera is a month old and it is now garbage.  While I understand policies are policies in terms of a warranty, I will not accept such poor treatment and customer service.  I teach photography and will tell my students the same thing -- if customer service and respect matter to you, then do not buy this camera.  
 As an active duty chaplain in the military I had a significant interest in chapter 9, Priests and Padres.  First, I was amazed at the number of references and her ability to read, organize, and synthesize them into a narrative.  These references, however, are derived from a significant number of ministers writings or sermons, which became the framework for her conclusions.  Furthermore, multiple references, representing several wars, are devoid of their cultural-historical context and woven into one sentence or paragraph leaving the reader to think the behavior, concept, or issue is timeless and characteristic of clergy.  I don't consider the chapter a valid historical analysis because of the limitations of the source material.  What the chapter does provide is a summary of her sources convictions and behaviors-which is not the whole story.  Since I considered her conclusions in chapter 9 highly subjective I did not read the rest of the book 
 I purchased one and it lasted about 3 months; light still worked but did not kill any bugs attracted to it.  Stinger replaced it under warranty-this time it lasted one month-same problem.  Stinger replaced it again under warranty and the third one lasted 1 1/2 months, again same problem.   Will not go to the trouble to get it replaced again-will buy a Flowtron which I had used 5 or 6 years ago and which lasted for 2-3 years.  
 I was totally disappointed.  I read the whole book and was still waiting for the information that would let me know that our pets are in spirit and wait for us in heaven. I felt that Mr. Kurz continually appologized through the whole book every time he mentioned a more spiritual way to look at this subject.  For example he brought up some Eastern philosophy, but appoloqized that he didn't really believe in it, and the idea that our animals can really talk to us through mental and emotional feelings.  And because he is a bible study teacher, he continually appologized to everyone that he would mention something that would not be directly explained in the bible.  It made me think he was not too confident in anything he wrote in the book to begin with.  There are many books available that are written by animal communicators, and other spiritual people that definitely give you more hope and understanding on this topic.  
 Wow. I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but somehow my negative review just disappeared from this page. Perhaps the book was not selling enough. What's up with that, Amazon? I really didn't like the book and the review didn't contain anything inappropriate. In an attempt to reconstruct the review...I thought that the book lacked an audience. There was not remotely enough detail for a regular reader of popular science books. The single chapter on entanglement in Brian Greene's "Fabric of the Cosmos" was much more enlightening than this entire book. I also don't see how a beginner would get anything out of this book. Too many things were just glossed over. Despite the dearth of detail about the main topic, the author saw fit to pad it with descriptions of Cantor's work, which is covered in many other books, including one of Mr. Clegg's. When referring to the uncountability of irrationals, he refers to them as "decimal fractions" and at one point, misleadingly, as simply "fractions", which are of course rational and countable. The book is a perfect example of the trend toward small, rapidly and inexpensively produced 250-page popular science books. Mr. Clegg is not a practicing scientist. He appears to be more of an entrepreneur and this shows in the quality of the book. I think my original review might have been pulled because I mentioned that I felt cheated because I bought the book on the 5-star recommendation of a particular UK popular science website, which appears to be an objective book review site. I found out that this site, which heavily pushes Mr. Clegg's books (he is always the featured author), appears to be controlled by him. He gives all of his books very high ratings of course. This seems incredibly deceptive to me. He has recently changed "featured author" to featured author/editor", though, perhaps in response to my original review. The web site is mentioned at the front of this book. So Amazon, in pulling the one bad review for this book (I've read about 100 popular science books in the past few years) left only the good reviews, including the first few 5-star reviews which are quite obviously planted by concerned parties. This seems deceptive also. Put your money into books that are a bit more substantial and took a bit more effort to write. BTW, the title is an unoriginal ripoff of Leon Lederman's wonderful "The God Particle". Mr. Clegg's book is a mediocre book about one of the most interesting (possibly the most interesting) phenomena in science. If this book had been written by Simon Singh, it would have been a winner 
 After watching the recent version of Jane Eyre presented by Masterpiece Theatre, I was hooked on everything Jane Eyre!  I immediately read the book and then purchased and watched this version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  After watching and immensely enjoying the Masterpiece Theatre version, this was just plain awful.  It is a multiple-episode TV version in which the acting and stage settings reminded me of a soap opera.  While I found it very truthful to the book, it lacked the wonderful acting, lush settings, beautiful music and cinematography of the Masterpiece Theatre version.  I watched it once and probably will never watch it again.  Invest in the Masterpiece Theatre version starring Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, you won't be sorry.  
 It's too bad that Clive Cussler changed collaborators on his "Oregon Files" series.  This was terrible!  I couldn't even finish it.  I read a lot in all different genres so I feel that I'm a little qualified to comment on a book I have read.  It dragged, some of the characters were changed and even though I know you have suspend disbelief, I couldn't keep my eyes open.  Golden Buddha and Sacred Stone were much better 
 The item you get is decorative at best.  Doesn't have any kind of a gong sound at all.  I suppose thats what it was met for but still...  The book it comes with is funny 
 If you enjoy a good, tightly plotted thriller -- read something else. This flabby, clunky and completely unbelievable story labors to its silly ending wheezing and gasping like an overweight commuter trying to catch the 8:45.  All of the characters are two dimensional and if you don't figure out the ending hundreds of pages before it arrives you are unconscious.       
 Stephen Hawking's Black Holes and Baby Universes and other Essays is a compilation of approximately a dozen essays and presentations made by Hawking from 1976 to 1992.  Though some of the essays deal with scientific issues (e.g. physics, cosmology, black holes) most of the book is autobiographical in nature discussing the author?s upbringing and struggle with ALCS.  Written in the aftermath of the popular A Brief history of the Universe, the current work is a rather blatant effort to exploit Hawking's popularity with minimum effort.  Although a short book (approx. 175 hardcover) there is much repetition amongst the essays.  Readers with even a passing knowledge of Hawking will find no new information in this book.  Overall, a disappointing book that has little to offer.  Only for the most dedicated Hawking aficionado 
 I was very excited about this unit when I ordered it, but the pixelation was very bad due to the variable bit rate (VBR) encoding, and the DivX recording feature didn't actually work most of the time.  (A blank screen or a green screen was the result.)  Unfortunately, given these problems, I returned the unit.  I think I'm going to look at an older ADS unit without the VBR feature to ensure quality, and then do any DivX transfers by software.  It seems that the fewer variables involved may make for a higher quality image.  Too bad...this one really had a lot of potential 
 I was very disappointed with this show. Having read the reviews I decided to buy the dvd, now I feel cheated. The jokes are weak, his inaccurate depiction of Africa and his off-the-mark African accent were more annoying than amusing. Jamie was crude, disgusting and even more disappointingly, not funny at all. He will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn't his best performance. He had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly. I do not recommend this dvd at all 
 You get a view into 60's white america. The only people of color in this book are a policeman, and a caricature. I don't have a problem with other Seuss books where they are set in fantasy land and the whole world is make believe. This is set in everyday life, and I think its best left on the bookshelf, it has nothing to offer my child who has and who lives in a world where folks have brown eyes and black hair, not to mention various shades of skin colour. The rhyming is also not entertaining enough to enjoy and makeup for this one-dimensional "white" depiction of the world 
 This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting 
 Let's see, I've owned these recordings on LP, cassette and at least 3 prior CD incarnations. I've dumped them all off in the past because I have never heard what so many others hear in these recordings. Where most hear demonstration-class recordings of a virtuosic band in a top-ranked interpretation, I hear a shallow, brittle and depth-less recording of a decent orchestra with less-than-sterling technical execution in a rather perfunctory interpretation by a fabled conductor.  Being so far off in my assessment when compared to received opinion, I've come to believe that there is something wrong with my ears. With that in mind, I picked up this recording/mastering for $5 at the Tower close-out yesterday, hoping to have my reaction to these recordings changed. Sorry to say I'm again gravely disappointed in these recordings on every level (as mentioned above).  If you really want to hear Richard Strauss in all his glory - both sound-wise and interpretively - than I suggest you turn to Karajan's non-digital DG recordings, Mehta's set with the LA Phil or Kempe's recordings on EMI (though I'm not fond of Kempe's Alpine Symphony).  I think I'm finally ready to give up on these over-rated recordings 
 As an astronomer working in a related field, I find this book to be extremely disappointing. While it contains much interesting science that is generally well presented, virually all of their main points rely very significantly on speculation well beyond what is well established science. Mankind's knowledge of processes such as the formation of Earth-like planets and especially the evolution of complex life forms is so poor that we can only observe what happened in our own system. Ward and Brownlee jump to the conclusion that complex life could only form in systems with histories very like out own, but in fact, they (as well as other scientists) really don't have any idea what is required for complex life to develop. Perhaps it would not sell so many books, but I would certainly rate the book more highly if the authors could be more honest about this 
 Porter's analysis of the health care system and its problems is right on yet his solutions could not be farther from the direction that the health care system must move to become a real system that serves all Americans.  There are so many flaws in the logic of the book and it is so impractical in its recommendations that I am not concerned that anyone will see it as a route to solving the ills of the US healthcare system.  Here are some of the main flaws. 1) Most people have very limited choice of providers - specifically the uninsured, people in rural areas, people in managed care plans, people whose employers offer only a limited selection of plans/doctors/hospital.  In order for "results" to drive increases in market share - one of Porter's main theses, people have to be able to choose where they will go for care.   2) Competition related to outcomes will slow down progress in medical care dramatically.  Hospitals and doctors, rather than rushing to share their newly discovered procedures with others - or share "best practices" for improving surgical outcomes will be incentivized to keep this "results" producing findings to themselves so they can publish better outcome statistics and attract more business. Is this what we want?  Don't we want physicians and institutions to openly share best practices to help everyone achieve better outcomes? 3) Porter believes that people should get care from the "best" specialists - even if this means travelling to another city or state for that care.  Ridiculous!  Once again this will increase the disparities in health outcomes between the rich and poor, the insured and the uninsured, people who have lots of medical knowledge and those who have little medical knowledge.  People better equipped, educationally or financially or through insurance coverage may travel to places to get better outcomes while the others get inferior care.  Is that what we want from our new health care system?  Porter's logic is seriously flawed.  It is the result of a profit-oriented mind trying to create solutions for a system that cannot be driven by profit but one which must be driven by concern for all Americans - a desire to achieve excellence wherever people go for care - and a need to raise the level of performance of all doctors and all health care institutions. Porter's solutions create an elitist model where care will improve for a very small number of people at the expense of the general population.  It is a non-solution to a complex problem.  If any proof is needed concerning how wrong Porter's model can be one must look at the data concerning the degree to which the poor and the uninsured go to hospitals doing low volumes of procedures and therefore, by implication, have worse outcomes.  These are the very places where the uninsured, people of color and others of limited means get a majority of their care in urban areas.  Just ask how Porter's solutions purport to help these underresourced institutions "compete" and as they loose resources to others, how they will maintain and improve the standard of services they now provide.    If you read this book, think about these issues and ask yourself if these are real solutions that serve all Americans.  I think you'll see what I mean 
 While the photography is stunning (by Kindra Clineff, whose name is misspelled on the cover), the text is wishy-washy and pointless. There is very little specific information on the places mentioned (history, architectural styles, etc) but rather vague inspiration for the home decorator. It's likely I'm the wrong audience for this book, but I came away from it feeling like I didn't learn anything about New England 
 This is an order I have been waiting to get since I order it on 1/23/07.  I ordered other items with this, I have received them all except this order of Pike Flannel full sheet set, forest green. I have been e-mail that they make take as long as the end of March or the 1st of April. They are already paid for and I would like to know if they are being sent soon. I'am an employee at the Chambersburg, Pa. Amazon.com I know we like to make are cumtomers # 1. Thank-You Lisa Barnhar 
 All the promos made me think that this would be a really great Sci-Fi story with beautiful babes all over the place.  Well, there WERE some beautiful babes but the anticipated provocative poses by sexy ladies, never materialized.  Has the art of "posing" been lost by modern girls?  Maybe all the good directors have retired or died!  What a pity...Why, I couldn't even muster a stiff upper lip as I played this DVD through to the end.   In spite of my being a certifiable "dirty old man". [:-)     
 The punishments, rules, and outrageous sermons get a little old in this book. I actually said outloud "ok, we get it, it's a religous cult!" Enough already. I think this book starts out pretty good but gets so dry and boring. And did the author really have to come up with the longest name ever for this churt - Fire and Brimstone and BLAH BLAH BLAH. And all the stuff about "If so and so sins, he shall pay $100, half to this dude and half to the Church of Fire and Brimstone blah blah" Ok, we get it. Geesh. I would just check this book out from the library instead of buying it. 
 Before I take this movie behind the woodshed for the sound thrashing it so richly deserves, I will tell you why people like it.  It's very pretty, the cinematography of post war Europe is lush and inviting, and the period recreation is well done.  It seems to shed light on important human themes of courage, perseverance, and hope in the face of cruelty and injustice.  It does do all this, in the same sense that Marvel comics do.    Lest you think that I am some knee-jerk, knuckle-dragging Neanderthal, let me quickly point out that I yield to no man in my devotion to what might be called "art house" fare.  I will never get back the hundreds of hours I have spent with the likes of Bernardo Bertolucci, Michelangelo Antonioni, Lina Wertmuller, Ingmar Bergman, and the Godfather of "What the heck was that all about?" - Federico Fellini.  I Am David most certainly targets the likes of me, liberal save the whales recycle now skateboarding is not a crime ban handguns club soda not seals intellectual dilettantes.  However, even the relentlessly tolerant must have limits.  They say character drives plot, which explains a lot.  David is a cipher, at best a symbol.  He has no character, which helps explain why the film has no plot.  [Those startling moments when it attempts to introduce plot points give one the feeling that somewhere a script writer has temporarily awoken from a coma, to which he quickly returns.]  Little David, our pint-sized Everyman figure, stumbles through the most ludicrous set of random encounters one might imagine, all designed to introduce him to the notion that humanity might not be irrevocably foul.  Saving a rich girl from death by fire is only the most preposterous.  Jim Caviezel, who disgraced his profession by agreeing to work with Mel Gibson in the widely viewed torture spectacle, Son Of Torah, is given nothing to do but grimace soulfully with a bar of soap in his hand.  Joan Plowright is alone in bringing acting skill to this picture; her performance looks radiant in comparison to the shabbiness around her.  If you're the type of person who bursts into tears as you stroll through the mall listening to Minnie Riperton singing, "Lovin' You," you'll probably find this film emotionally compelling 
  I thought that I would love this book because I am interested in JFK.  	 What I found was a lousy book that spent much of it detailing Kennedy's political career and leaves out or does not go into much detail about significant events that happened to him while in Political Office. Also much of the info can be found in numerous other books about JFK or the Kennedy Family with little new information.  I was also disappointed about his discussion about the assassination. After all this time and all the information out there the author still thinks that Oswald killed JFK.  If you are interested in JFK, this might not be the book for you 
 As someone who has a deep love and respect for nature, I found the book a severe disappointment.  Parts of the book are utterly beautiful, and her use of language is creative and provocative.  However, much of it comes across as the rantings of a hardened and arrogant cynic.  Clearly from the first pages, Griffiths has adopted the Wilds as her religion, and her posture toward it is nothing short of worship.  She abhors anything to do with the West or with contemporary culture and society, and adores the "noble savage", an attitude which in itself smacks of paternalism.  Her sneering dismissal of Christianity--which many of her readers may find acceptable--is laden with ignorance about the actual facts, and amusing (although not surprising) in comparison to her unquestioning veneration of Eastern and other indigenous spiritualities 
 I'm a huge Tom Berenger fan but I simply can't say anything good about this film.  The plot is horrible, the acting unconvincing (even Berenger), the dialouge laughable and the ending, well, sour to say the least.  The pits 
 Curious as to why Amazon would charge for this content when CBS offers it for free on the official Survivor Website.  Yeah, at the CBS site you have sit through 4 commercials, but it is worth it to not have to download any extra programs 
 I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy. I love THE AENEID by Virgil, THE ODYSSEY by Homer. I read both long versions of LES MISERABLES and THE HUNCHBACK OF NORTE DAME by Victor Hugo. I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.  But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters! Dickens did a fine job on THE CHRISTMAS CAROL. But I will NEVER read another of his books 
 This book was an enjoyable story, but it had many points that did not hold my attention. I also could not find much interest in the book due to the fact that it was a tedious story. Many points got boring and I would have trouble concentrating. This is just an average book. I would only reccomend it to a middle-school reader. 
 I ordered this magazine thru Amazon three months ago, and STILL haven't received a single issue.  I've emailed their subscription department to no avail.  They have my money, but i don't have a magazine 
 Now don't get me wrong: I'm all in favor of Bloom's now-unfashionable liberal-humanist method of interpretation arising, as it must, from balancing wide experience with close reading.  In fact, I'm in favor of any critical approach that illuminates, appreciates, elucidates, and speculates, as long as it's coherent and interesting to read. I agree with Bloom that contemporary criticism has become mostly an unreadable, hidebound, tendentious parody of itself written, primarily to earn tenure, written largely by embittered academics who are mad as hell that they have so little influence on the ways of the world.     Others may disagree.  Yet, for all Bloom's specialized knowledge and obvious passion for Shakespeare, his magnum opus poorly serves the purposes of good criticism.  Who is he writing for? Other critics, it would seem. To appreciate Bloom's book, unlike the work of, say, Harold Goddard, whose name Bloom invokes as a model, you have to know plenty about Shakespeare already. Thhis isn't a book for beginners.  You also need to overlook Bloom's tendency toward vagueness and lack of cohesiveness.  Granted, there's so much even one writer can say about Shakespeare that it's difficult to write tightly and concisely, but Bloom's commentaries do seem to ramble with insufficient emphases and rather hazy direction. I felt a less than agreeable mixture of tedium, annoyance, and uncertainty as I read Bloom's "Shakespeare."  It's hard to believe he's writing about the Western world's most read, most honored, most brilliant, most resourceful author.  The excitement that Bloom  felt as a youngster reading the plays and the poems for the first time just doesn't come through.  His initial enthusiasm has morphed into deep and abstract thought that only another literary critic will appreciate. And, of course, not all of them.  This would have been a great book if somebody else had written it.  Somebody like the now-derided but wonderfully readable A.C. Bradley, whose work on Shakespearean tragedy is still in print and still great after one hundred years.  (When Bradley wastes your time - an exaggeration, really - by speculating, for example, on how many children Lady Macbeth really had, he has the courtesy to do so in an appendix.) It seems symptomatic of their approaches that Bradley, also a liberal critic, was overwhelmed by how closely Shakespeare got his characters to resemble us.  For Bloom, it's vice versa. If you think that's an interesting idea (and it is), don't get your hopes too high: it gets submerged, like most of Bloom's interesting ideas, in the enclosing sea of rumination.     
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 After reading "The Kite Runner" - a deeply involving and heart wrenching story of friendship, loyalty and forgiveness amidst the backdrop of life in Afghanistan during the Russian war and the Taliban rule, I set out expecting more of the same from the Swallows of Kabul.  The latter was quite disapointing.    The Swallows of Kabul focusses on 4 main characters struggling to maintain their dignity and humanity amidst the violence, cruelty and desolation of their surroundings.  The dismal context of this story is properly set up.  Enough time is spent in illustrating the violence and suppression of human rights by the Taliban and the desperation of the Afghan people is clearly communicated. Unfortunately, the novel reads like a short story.  Proper character development is not established, so the reader ends up having little or no sympathy for its key characters who want for more redeeming traits.    The novel is successful in  painting a truly depressing picture of Afghanistan, making us thank our lucky stars for being far removed from such a place.  But if you're looking for an inspiring tale of how the human spirit triumphs over such dismal circumstances, then I wouldn't recommend this book for you.  I was glad to have turned the last page and put this book down 
 I love Billy Blanks Lower Body and Ultimate Bootcamp dvds.  I tried his Ab Bootcamp, thinking it would be great too, but what a letdown.  I'm not sure why so many other reviewers liked it so much...maybe it's just me.  His favorite move is standing and rotating the torso from side to side.  I felt it in the abs a little, but he keeps going back to it OVER AND OVER and it bothered my back. Also he makes some comment that your neck will stop hurting if you just suck it up and strengthen the neck muscles.  If you are pulling on your neck and using bad form that he teaches you, you can get hurt.  Most of the video is done standing up.  He focuses more on the obliques (sides) than the rectus abdominus (front).  At first I liked the move where you rotate your hip up and bring your elbow down, isolating the obliques.  But I got bored of it after 10 minutes of the same thing.  He does crunches standing up too.  You stand in this hunched over squatting position (which I'm sure is bad for the back), put your hands behind your head, and contract your abs, pulling your head down (pulling on the neck).  I thought this was a lot of work for the rest of the body but I didn't feel it in my abs at all.  I prefer to do crunches on the floor, which uses more resistance since you're lifting the upper body against gravity.  He does have some good floor moves in there at the end that I've never seen before.  It might be worth a rental to see those.  As usual, Billy shows his lack of stretching knowledge.  His stretching routine usually involves swinging the arms like in Tai Chi...which really doesn't stretch anything.  I found it weird that he does a quad stretch and a hamstring stretch at the end of an Ab workout.  Wouldn't you expect an ab stretch?  Or a back stretch?  This video is about 30 minutes.  It might seem short, but when you're targeting only 1 muscle group, that's a long time.  I thought my abs would be twice as sore compared to another dvd I have which is 15 mins, but the only thing that's sore is my back.  I guess I'll keep looking - I've heard good things about Gilad's Abs Workout 
 The book never arrived--Instead I was sent (3 months later) a small paperback entitled "Helping Children Accept Themseves and Others" from Better World Books.  Perhaps Adam Smith would agree that this is the market at work but in the future "Better World Books" will not be my market 
 You have to really be interested in the author's self importance to enjoy this book.  It grated on me on almost every page.  Despite its subject, I found it unflinchingly cold and also, extremely boring.  Maybe it was her point, but it's as though she's writing a academic text on grief and death ~ from quite a distance.  Frankly, I could not finish it as I decided life is too short to force myself to finish any book this difficult to get through.  The name dropping and "we were such a wonderful, powerful couple" gets so tedious I rolled my eyes more than a few times.  The medical detail and quotes from other sources on grief do not make it any more interesting, though I hoped it would.  I am surprised so many people liked this book.  I guess it boiled down to the fact that I did not find the author likeable and couldn't swallow the writing style; so had little interest in what she had to say 
 Lynn Grabhorn attempts to convince us that there is another Earth which she names Planet Two, that exists simultaneously with Earth 1, but in another higher vibrational state.                      This other Earth is much like ours, but also very different. That's about all I want to say about her "theory". Reading this  book was ponderous and infuriating! It's one detailed, but gigantic mess!! Most infuriating to me was her statement that certain animals that we eat on Earth 1 (I'm a Vegetarian) will still be consumed by humans on Earth 2, because these animals have collectively decided to serve man this way by allowing themselves to be mass-farmed, then cruelly suffer before being butchered and killed sometimes still alive, for mankind's consumption! Give me a break!! There are way too many other thoroughly insane statements, assumptions and conclusions that she draws in this bizarre book! Lynn should have stopped after she wrote her classic: "Excuse me, your Life is Waiting" which I wholeheartedly recommend. As for Planet Two? Avoid it like the plague 
 I don't even know where to start.   If she wasn't so (as we are constantly reminded) well-educated and well travelled I would assume that the author just didn't know how to be a gracious guest. Instead of relishing this rare hospitality (Amish families very rarely invite Englisch guests to stay with them) she repeatedly criticizes her first host family (the wife isn't fit enough, the food isn't healthy enough, her room isn't big enough.) Then when a second family allows her to stay with them she thinks that being their guest for two weeks means she has a right to belittle their plans to expand their homestead to included a much needed birthing center for the community. And to top it all off, when she gets home, she's too special to share her experiences with regular people, and now thinks the people who were previously her social peers are like "sharks."  This book is not worth your time. There are several excellent books that include far more insight into the lives of the Amish and far less over-intellectualized, self-centered, whining and condescension. See "Driving the Amish" by Jim Butterfield 
 Phantom of the Opera has been a huge part of my life over the years, I heard and saw many casts of the show, I bought the books, I watched the movies, you get my point. This recording does not however represent how the show actually sounds live or what this cast was capable of in London and on Bway. Since, I think, this was recorded before the show even premiered that explains the bloodless quality of the recording. It's pretty, yes, but I'm never gripped as I was by this cast when hearing & seeing live material. Crawford sounds whiny and way too fake for me here and Brightman's musgy diction and sloppy singing is a disgrace. Steve Barton is a wonderful Raoul but even he got dragged down by the sterility of this recording. I do NOT hate this cast, in my opinion the OLC and OBC are amazing but exactly WHY the show reduced me to tears is not captured on this recording. Compared to that I much prefer the OCR (Canadian cast), OSC (Swedish cast) and the film cast. None of which offers the sterile beauty of this recording but they are all pulsing with passion and gripping drama 
 Not what I expected for the price and the color shipped was wrong.  Even though I contacted the seller, have received no response 
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 This book really sucked! Save your money!  The I have tried to contact Mr. Herman about some of the problems I have encountered with the contact addresses he provided.  He has yet to respond, meanwhile, I have wasted valuable postage for addresses that are incorrect or not in existance.  One other note, many of the persons contacted were not accepting new talent, and hadn't been for quite sometime 
 I'm an agronomist and I read this trash-book, here in Brazil. This book , as a tipical pseudo-historic book, puts some real things.Even with some real things, all are used as a cover to frauds and bigoted anti-catholic absurds. A tipical anti-catholic absurd is the claim in this book, that Pius XII was a racist, using the "fact" that this Pope claimed that any "Black" american soldier in Rome, because Pius XII "thought" they were rapers. Nonsense.The real allied troop full of rapers and in Italy, wasn't a black american division.It was really an arabian troop serving the De Gaulle's "Free France".This trash-book "forgets" the fact and invent an anti-catholic fraud. In fact, Pius XII was an eugenics' foe. The opposite was true among famous protestants and jews, at that times. During the civil rights fights in USA, during 1950 decade, Pius XII showed that he was against eugenics/racism again. This trash book draws an absurd and never existed Pius XII. Who gave power to Hitler were eugenicists and communists. Pius XII ever was a Hitler's foe 
 I had no idea that Charlie Daniels was a ninja.  But, apparently he is.  He sits in on this diatribe with the good "doctor."  Doctor of what, they don't tell you.  But, if "Dr." is good enough for the legendary fiddle player, it's good enough for me.  Sign me up 
 The new "Christy" was ok. But the original cast with Kelly Martin and Tyn Daly will alway be Christy and Miss Alice. I just thought that the girl they got to play Christy was so bland and calm when the Character was actually a little more fiesty. But that wasn't even my main problem with it. My problem was that they had replaced all the character's which is fine, but if your going to do that. Then replace all that characters. Dr.Mcneil is played by that same actor that was in the telvision series. He had chemistry with Kelly Martin. You knew those two. They had no history with him and "NEW CHRISTY". It just didn't seem right to have him played by the same man and everyhting around him different. I might have enjoyed it more if they had gotten a different actor b/c then I wouldn't thought through the whole thing, NO THIS WRONG. We watched the series as him and Kelly battled and domewhat flirted and You were so upset when they left you hanging. But to add new people and then keep him. Just wasn't right.. 
 The shuttle bay door will fall off in no time.  The booster rockets will be next.  The ability to stand it up on the launch pad will last a few days at best.  And the robot arm is cheap garbage.  This is my experience with a 4 year old boy, but it applies to all ages 
 This DVD is advertised as close-captioned, but it is not.  I purchased it for a friend who is deaf and I am disappointed that she cannot enjoy it 
 This book is a mixture of interviews (that are quite interesting) and insight (that is too thinly explained and mostly concerns IT companies). The book IS of small size and easily portable, which seems to be the main promise, and it says it includes quick tips (it delivers, some), but also speedy solutions (doesn't deliver, because they don't exist, and most of the explanations and case studies are too short and superficial for anything to be learned from them) and cutting-edge ideas (for one business only). Suffices as a series of facts and listing of interesting company names, but not much help for a practitioner, and for a MBA degree a student would need many many many more books. 
 A useful book that provides a good summary comparing differing Accounting Standards and approaches between countries.  However, it is not worth the price.  It is supposedly written for later year undergraduate and masters accounting students.  It is more suitable for general second year accounting students.  Plus, as I am working with a multinational European bank in Japan, the book is, rapidly becoming, out of date.  There is none of the simply but incisive commentary which can be found in other books about the differences and outcomes of general accounting principals drawn from different countries 
 This is a good example of the typical self-delusion of creationism passing as serious thought.  All the book really proves in its pages is that if a person wishes something to be so badly enough, it will become so, but only in his or her own mind.  The stratigraphic "evidence" is selectively presented in a distortive, inaccurate fashion, so as to suit conclusions previously reached.  The serious reader on the subject is far better advised to read Kurten's "Not From the Apes", and not some drivel like this book 
 What a load of garbage.  Equating a camera with a gun and the act of photography with a violent crime, is so ridiculous it does not even deserve to be discussed.  She has no idea waht she is talking about 
 OK, Basquiat, at age 19- see the actual person. PERIOD(so wonderfully played by Wright  in movie "Basquiat")What a major trainwreck of film this is.Should have stayed where it was buried. Sorry, won't waste my time to list all the many, very many reasons, already wasted my money. 
 This book is so full of lies, half truths, misquotes, out of context quotes and manipulations that it would even make the devil blush. Actually, simple research will find many blatant lies in all of her books. She uses end notes in her books, but calls them footnotes. Endnotes are much harder to research as compared to footnotes and appear at the end of the book, not at the bottom of the page. I could list each lie, but the review would be pages long, especially when typing out the quotes she uses and the real quotes. Do your own research if you'd like, and I challenge Ann Coulter's fans to research her lies. But I digress, I think that most people who read her books, however, just want to reconfirm what they already believe and will not bother to research inaccuracies. Her most famous style of lying however, is using newspaper quotes out of context, or changing what the person said, or simply just making it up. A simple LexisNexis Search will reveal most of her lies. I found that more than 60% of this book was made up, twisted, or taken out of context, the other 40% was name-calling, insulting broad generalisations,and angry ranting which is, ironically, slander itself. Wow, what a great view of the Republican Right. If I were a Republican, I would NOT be proud to have her on my team. She is juevenile, brash, and most of all, a liar. I hope she fazes out of favor with the American public because she is toxic and an example of what is wrong in American Politics today, despite what side of the fence you sit on. I feel that lying to prove your point and name-calling is poisenous, egregious and morally bankrupt, no matter what political party you belong to. Do yourself a favor, and read a book by another author. If you do choose to read this, I challenge you to look further into what she writes. The lies begin in the first few pages.   
 I borrowed this book from the library, as I have been very hesitant to spend the money on Cat Who books lately.  This one has set the seal on it, though...I don't even want to read them any more.  Even Koko and Yum Yum have been made totally uninteresting.  This is a series which should have retired on a positive note because so many people enjoyed it.  Instead, the publisher has run it into the ground through sheer incompetence.  I hope there is some poor lowly soul at Putnam whose job it is to read customer feedback and pass it on to the fools in charge...maybe they will finally let this series rest in piece 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 So for the most part, people have been giving this book good reviews.  My personal opinion is that the book is terrible.  Part of the problem with books of this nature is that historians don't understand biology, and biologists don't understand history.  Kelly's major fault lies in his understanding of plague's biology.  He suggests that the Black Death may have been the reason for the increased frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion.  He cites an article from 1998.  I doubt he read the article nor anything about the topic further.  In the original journal article (Stephens, et al., [1998], Am. J. Hum. Gen., 62:1507-1515), the Swedes, at 14%, have the highest frequency of the deletion with the Chinese as the lowest.  The Black Death struck China too, so why do so few people have the deletion there?  This same problem plagues (pun very much intended) Scott & Duncan's work (Biology of Plagues, 2001; Return of the World's Greatest Serial Killer, 2005).  What Kelly fails to miss is the abundance of research that shows that Y. pestis doesn't interact with the chemokine receptors, which would have caused the elevation of frequency (the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion confers protection against AIDS).  This is just one of many faults in his presentation of Y. pestis as the causative agent of the Black Death.  He also plagarizes; see p. 25 of his work and p. 24 of Herlihy's The Black Death and the Transformation of the West 
 I haven't got this item because it is too expensive for what it gives. I have a Fujifilm E550 camera which cost is USD 250.00 by this date. This lens cost is USD 95.00 and it need a special adapter ring that cost extra USD 20.00. That means you will pay USD 365.00 for a 8x zoom camera. For that price or less you can get a +10x SLR like camera like the Fujifilm S5100 or S5200. 
 Some of the most dangerous ideas that are implicitly or explicitly advanced in this book include the following:  1.	Teaches that being created in the image of God endows all men with God-like power in their very nature and that seizing upon such powerful nature is the key to the Christian life.  In other words, Eldredge propagates the great lie that is subtly manifest in many of the world's religions, namely that people can be like God, which lie is first described in the Bible at Genesis 3:5.    2.	Ignores the doctrine of sanctification and all of its implications for the Christian including, among others, God's disciplining of His children, the sinful nature that remains in the Christian and the continued need for repentance, and the requirement that the Christian seek to test his own thoughts and the thoughts of those around him with the Word of God.  This has been called an error of "realized eschatology," and essentially plays perfectly into the deification of man and the worship of the creature.  3.	Teaches that the beginning of the Christian walk is when an individual admits that the sin in his life is caused by a wound that they have received from another.  This stands in stark contrast to the Word of God, which teaches that the Christian life begins with repentance, which is when a man admits that he is solely to blame for the sin in his life.  4.	Adds to and arguably supplants the doctrine of original sin with another universally applicable cause of sin, the "wound" or the "soul wound".  According to Eldredge, the "wound" is caused by the denial of a boy by others, most often the boy's father, in word or deed, of the boy's true powerful nature and the good, inborn desires that flow from such nature.    5.	Finally and worst of all, the book tends to liberate men from guilt for their own sin without one reference to the cross of Christ  
 Hardly any detail in the examples and missing too many important and common techniques 
 BAD EXPERIANCE!!!   Stay AWAY from this "Bad Faith" seller!!!  Dosent even reply to e-mails!!!   
 Those who feel that the movie seems anti-Bowie are correct, which also accounts for Bowie's withholding of any of his songs for use in the film.  Those who think the script is merely fiction with composite characters are sadly mistaken. The elaborate sets for the film are interesting, the music is good (excepting the obvious lack of Bowie), but almost everything else is awful. Velvet Goldmine's script is based on notorious scandal monger and slimeball Tony Zanetta's sophomoric and out of print "tell-all" book from his brief time working for MainMan, Bowie's first professional production company.  Zanetta's book, "Stardust: The David Bowie Story" is in the grand tradition of exploitative vendetta books written by former employees of succesful artists. It's a shame that the producers and director were able to use even a single Bowie song for the use as the film's title 
 I am very happy with my Meridian Color and the other mapsend products I have purchased, however, at first I couldnt get this product to work.  I had no problem getting this software to run with XP (even without the patch), however I couldnt view the basemap I had loaded onto my Magellan.  I tried to address this with the company.  It has been three days now and they have not even returned my emails.  Customer service for this product is nonexistant.  I joined the Yahoo message board and got a simple answer to my question in about four hours someone posted the answer.  Turns out I just had to go to the Menu -- Card Utilities and maunually select the basemap.  I did not know that basemaps dont change automaticaly like the detailed maps do.  I cannt say enough great things about my experience with my magellan meridian color though.  Navigating through Hungary like a pro, I didnt miss a single turn.  I would never recommend any of their products to someone who isnt willing or doesnt have the aptitude to learn about it.  The Magellan Meridian series is in my opinion the finest product on the market for what it does, portability it provides and is 100 percent upgradable with new software and new maps.  Get you head out of your a__ Thales.  You have some great products, but you are blowing your customer support base with non existant customer support.  I recommend anyone with a question about softward or the GPS join the yahoo groups and post the question there.  Dont waste your time with customer support. 
 I take yoga in a gym.  The class starts as the aerobics session ends.  I bought these socks to help keep my feet warm during class.   Using the socks my big toes were uncomfortably separated from the rest of my foot.  I expected more elastic.  They made my foot cramp during the class.  Because I had worn them once I could not return them.  Now I do not know what to do with them.  I should throw them out but I spent money on them 
 I love a dark comedy more than the next person, and laugh at things that I probably really shouldn't.  So I thought this movie, hyped as a very dark comedy, would be right up my alley.  Sadly, apart from a few moments here and there, "Very Bad Things" simply fails as a comedy.  And it fails as a drama, because every single character is unlikeable and unsympathetic.  That's too bad, because the actors are fantastic and do their best with the material given to them.  I fault the script, which has problems at best, and the direction and editing, which give the movie a strangely languid character at inopportune times.  You could do worse, but this is strictly a rental at best.  
 What do you get? Well, a lawsuit for plagiarism, but that isn't what I'm going to talk about here.  The Island started pretty well. Production design was great. The story was intriguing. Very nice job of introducing questionable elements into the 'perfect society'. I thought Michael Bay was going to surprise me. The product placement was irritating and cheesy, but I could live with it. While the writing was pretty corny, it was still nice to see Michael Bay trying something a little different for him. Something smarter. But once our heroes escape, the movie nosedives. It felt like two completely different movies were tacked together.  As I said, I was enjoying the beginning. The survivors of an unspecified "contamination" dwell within a sterile, self-contained city. Their happiness and well being is paramount to those in charge. They are watched over and coddled. They have no real concerns. They live a life of leisure while holding out hope that they will be the next lottery winner, which promises them a one-way trip to The Island, the last uncontaminated place on Earth.   Once you discover The Truth, the rest of the movie degrades to non-stop car and foot chases. Explosions, shattered glass and twisted metal and lots of running and yelling fill out the last hour and a half or so.  I'm all for action movies. Loved Die Hard and many Schwarzenegger movies. It's that the over-the-top action seemed so out of place with this particular story. It seems to me that if I was the head of a company and its' future was up in the air because some damaging information was stolen, I wouldn't think that the best solution would be to send a heavily armed militia through crowded downtown Los Angeles to retrieve it. For the story that was being told, some Hitchcock style suspense would have worked much better.  Like I said, the start was promising. Then the movie switched gears. After about an hour I was just wishing the movie would end already. I've read that this is Michael Bay's best movie yet. That may be, but it sure doesn't say much for him as a director.  I've just found out that this movie was plagiarized from 'The Clonus Horror'. That one got the MST3K treatment, but I'm betting that I'll still enjoy it more than this movie 
 I found this book disappointing. Its pages drag on and on but never deal with the topic. It addresses why, but not the how. I was looking for the how 
 Dr. Andrew Fielding, a quantum physicist, is killed, although it's made to look like he died of natural causes. David Tennant, MD, assumes he's next. They are two of the six men in the inner circle of the scientific team funded by National Security Agency working on Project Trinity.  Trinity is a massive, secret (big surprise!) government-funded effort to build a supercomputer dedicated to artificial intelligence - a computer that thinks. David is on the team to keep the ethics in line, as he is a Professor of Ethics at the University of Virginia Medical School. He has been seeing a psychiatrist, Rachel Weiss, the past few months because of his narcolepsy, the side effect he encountered after undergoing his `superscan' into the Trinity computer. All six of the inner circle had been scanned and each had a different side effect. Thus, his crusade to find the cause of everyone's neurological symptoms.  David figures out who killed Dr. Fielding, so he and Rachel have to make a run for it. The story details their narrow escapes, David's realization of who is betraying him, and how he overcomes these difficulties. Who do you trust is really a big question. Trinity `goes live' and causes chaos and confusion around the world. David and Rachel play a big part in getting Trinity working for good, not evil.  This was a tad too sci-fi for my taste and too long, partly because of the detailed descriptions of David's hallucinations (where he sometimes sees himself as Jesus).  If you're a computer nut and like technical subjects, you'll like this book 
 Simply put, this book is a tedious, crashing bore.  It might do as an example of how NOT to write a book, but there is really no redeeming value otherwise.      The greatest problem with the work is the "nested" narratives, as one reviewer refers to them, that comprise the book.  First, a shipwrecked ex-monk begins to tell Melmoth's descendent his (long, tedious, uninteresting) story. Then, fleeing from the Spanish Inquisition and hiding in an underground series of caverns, he begins to translate a book. The narrative then shifts to said book, where we begin the "Tale of The Indians". In the middle (more or less) of this tale the narrative shifts once again to Melmoth The Wanderer himself who tells the story of "The Guzman Family" and "The lovers' tale". Finally, the "Tale of the Indians" reaches its conclusion after these drawn-out interruptions. Subsequently-you guessed it-the narrative shifts again (it's not clear at this point if it's back to the book (which is never mentioned again) or to the narrative of the ex-monk.  Then, we have a sort of anticlimactic conclusion. The great problem in all these narratives is that the authorial voice NEVER CHANGES, not one scintilla. It's still Marturin telling the tale, without even an attempt to alter the style or voice of the telling to the series of changing raconteurs.       Marturin supposedly started this work as an extension of a sermon he preached. I think that is the only way to understand it or appreciate it, (if you're given to such things) as an anti-Catholic, anti-free-thinking screed against all who aren't devout (non-Catholic) Christians.  If you truly believe in the Lake of Fire and the damnation of souls for pursuing knowledge.- Instead of seated on a prayer stool, where one obviously ought to be-this is the book for you.-Heretics need not apply---Otherwise, for the sane reader, a colossal waste of time and attention.    Let me aver here (and commend to same sane reader) that the truly great and classic novel of this sort is James Hogg's Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner: A truly eerie account of religious obsession, with profound and haunting psychological/spiritual insight, that will leave even the most modern reader chilled and thoughtful 
 Yeah, like most everyone else I got a set with a defective disk--Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, one of my favorites. Contacted Universal, told I would hear back within a week, and receive a replacement disk--that was two days after this set was released. Still haven't heard a thing, still waiting for my "replacement disk." Just should have returned the set to Amazon and got it over with. I doubt I will purchase the next set. Well, Universal and NBC have merged, so you get lousy DVDs, Katie Couric, and The Left..er WEST Wing from the same source 
 The rhythms in this music are so monotonous, songs go on and on and on, with no direction, as if the songwriter didn't know how to end the song.  Very disappointed in this because an intelligent person recommended this album and I expected much much better.     Just a bunch of over-drugged and over-sexed punks, no role models here!    I don't recomend you buy this one.   
 "Our Kind," Kate Walbert's novel-in-stories about the psychological malaise afflicting women who became adults in the 1950s and who are now confronting life in their 60s, never achieves its intriguing premise.  Walbert's individual stories lack coherence; her prose tends to be overwritten, precious or overly obscure; her characters rarely invite sympathy or compassion, much less understanding.  Though Walbert intends "Our Kind" to provide insight into the genuine existential dilemmas aging women experience, the novel is really little more than a litany of sorror that poor little rich girls  --  now women  -- encounter.  Each character, whether she be physically disabled, ditzy, an artist, a widow, cancer-stricken, jaded or booze-addled, has been "led down a primrose lane, then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond."  Forsaking intellectual aspirations and career possibilities contemporary women now presume as birthrights, these erudite, Smith-educated, polished (like prized apples) and repressed (orgasm-starved) characters chose or had chosen for them a life of taking "dictation from war heroes in grey suits."  Their college curriculum consisted of the "3 G's:  Grace, Grooming and Grammar.  Some of us dropped out before Grace."  They did everthing their men asked them to:  be homemakers, silent hostesses, acquiescent sexual partners and mothers.  Yet, somewhere, by middle age, the wheels had fallen off.  The women of "Our Kind" keen with pain and betrayal.  Their collective voices form a chorus of sorrow and lament, not the presupposed aria of joy, contentment and fulfillment they had envisioned hearing.  "Our Kind" is a filled with an ineluctable sadness and no small amount of unresolved bitterness.  The women, budding with excitement in their 20s, now have gone to seed.  And what a disparate assortment of seeds...hair greying, unspoken anger bubbling over, regrets denouncing false hopes.  Their loneliness slaps them daily across their reconstructed faces.  Each character, because of Walbert's preculiar, ill-chosen style, never fully articulates her angst.  Yet, we can imagine them in their earlier lives, seated at their elegantly-arranged dinner tables, designing and executing parties to further their husands' careers, painfully aware that genuine conversations (like those savored with their professors in the Seven Sister Colleges) will never involve them.  Their very lives are in perpetual deferment.  All the elements for significant story telling are here.  Walbert's bon-mots, sprinkled at the end of each chapter ("our hearts worn down by the slow drumming of blood," "we are...a school of fish too old to spawn but desperate to swim back upstream"), indicate a writer with great talent.  Yet, "Our Kind" disappoints.  Its structure, lack of narrative drive and choice of affluent, suburban, east-coast women (far removed from most American women's experiences) doom to the novel to be as satisfying as a furtive tryst with a hired pool boy 
 This will be short and not so sweet. I was disappointed in this book for one reason, it read like a text book, and a very boring text book at that. I don't mean any disrespect because I know this work took hundreds of hours, and the information was very interesting, but like I said it was boring and I had to struggle through just to finish i 
 "BURY MY HEART AT WOUNDED KNEE" was assigned as my 9th grade Honors U.S. History II summer reading assignment.  My class was told that it would help to lead us into this chapter in our history class.  The first day of school, the teacher asked us how the book was coming along and found out firsthand just how open a class we are.  We all hated it.  It was terrible!  Every chapter tells a different tribe's story, but it was all the same.  This book was so repetitive.  There is a fight, there is a treaty, the whites break the treaty, there is another fight, and the Indians endure a terrible massacre.  I was saddened to read about the poor Indians, but it got a little old after the first 5 times or so.  Many of the people in my class are having so much trouble getting through the book, that they are either skimming through the book and risking the bad grade, or are buying the summary of each chapter off of a website.  The review on the front of the book reads, "...Impossible to put down."  I found this true because after around 20 pages of reading this book, I would fall asleep with the book in my hand.  If you are planning to read this book, please understand how repetitive it is and rethink your decision 
 Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, and others in the Pre-Trib circle, such as Ed Hindson, Tommy Ice, Chuck Missler, etc., continue to put forth the same deceptions that Hal Lindsey popularized decades ago.  The notion of a pre-tribulation rapture is foreign to scripture, it is foreign to the teachings of the early Church, and it is grooming the Church for destruction through ignorance and lack of preparation for what is really coming.  These men are novices and not prophecy "experts" or "scholars" by any stretch of the imagination; they are those who tickle the ears of gullible Christians.  Why continue to be deceived?  Tim Cohen, in his excellent book, The AntiChrist and a Cup of Tea, provides biblically sound and testable evidence to show that the coming AntiChrist is known NOW.  Not only that, the same author (Tim Cohen) has now put out the strongest presentation on the whole issue of the rapture EVER offered to the saints of God in Christ: The REAL Rapture.  If you really want to know the truth about the timing of the coming rapture, then you need to hear Tim Cohen's The REAL Rapture (based on a volume in his forthcoming "Messiah, History, and the Tribulation Period" series (see Prophecy House's web site for details on these items) 
 I read this book because it says it was a best seller, and the author is supposed to be one of the best at suspense.  With those expectations I was disappointed.  The author relies on gimmicks - like ultra short chapters to make it seem like you're reading faster.  Each chapter is 1 or 2 pages with at least one blank page between, so what looks like a 400 page books is really only a 250 page short novel.  One chapter is literally a cliff-hanger.  The plot's sort of a rehash of H.G. Wells' Island Of Dr. Moreau, borrowing a bit from X-Men comic books.  The mutants are all children who can fly, and they're severely persecuted by their keepers, so perhaps what makes the book appealing to other readers is the suspense derived from the endangered children angle, another cheap gimmick.    The villains are all one-dimensional stereotypes, blindly abandoning all their principles and humanity to profit off the children.  I could point out numerous flaws in style as well - but that's not the point; you could find flaws in better books too.  The point is the book is overrated for hack writing of less quality than many old pulp magazines I've read.  Even the love scenes are corny and seem like one of those cheap romance novels ("My arms were high and tight around his neck.  He pulled me against him and I felt him, all of him, against my thigh . . ."). The author also doesn't seem to understand the geography & terrain of the area he's writing about (for example, a small Sony TV won't receive Denver channels in Gunnison National Forrest, certainly not well enough to recognize faces in long shots as the author describes), and has some weird ideas of horror ("Chain link fence and concertina wire and guard dogs in the middle of the woods were scary enough, but to see the words "U.S. Government" attached to "Trespassers Will Be Shot" made me ill.").  Much more like this is topped off with a liberal dose of hypocrisy:  "The arrogance and amorality of the scientists working here affronted everything I believed in.  I wanted to find one of 'them' and strangle the person with my bare hands."   This is the last time I'll buy a book because it says "best seller."  If you want to read a well-written sci-fi suspense novel in which the protagonist is a child prodigy, I recommend The Fourth R by George O. Smith (ISBN 1557429332 - Also known as The Brain Machine, ISBN 0824014308) 
 First of all this book is a great failure, from the point of view of who the author is. It is a shame that Crone was forced by Columbia University Press to write this kind of general survey. The book only repeats what has been know for more than 50 or 60 years. Scholars such as Laoust have already given us a much better account of these issues. In fact, one feels that this is almost a translation of Laoust's book. Importantly, there is no political theorizing in this work, only description. This is really nothing but a basic and not so practical textbook that pretends to be scholarship. I hope Crone will use in a more scholarly way her position at the School of Advanced Studies. This is not the kind of book one expects from her 
 I love this turban. It enables me to dry my hair without wearing a huge towel on my head. It's lightweight and extremely absorbant. I have been using one for more than 5 years. I'll never go back to usung a regular towel for my hair 
 The ebook version contains maps, figures and pictures which are unreadable 
 Buyer Beware!  This book, titled, "Stealing Love: Confessions of a Dognapper" doesn't begin to even MENTION the author's dognapping until page 237 (in a book that is 267 pages long), and those events are just a minor part of what the book is really about -- the author's unfortunate and unhappy childhood.    I purchased this book in an airport bookstore and then struggled through it on a 6-hour flight, wondering when the dognapping was going to start?  Thank goodness Amazon has reduced the selling price significantly -- this book is not worth the $23.00 list price 
 When I first wrote a review for this movie I will confess that I was angry that it did not have any demons or evil monsters from hell, but upon further review I must take back my previous opinion, and say that though Doom the movie does not carry the spirit of doom into it it is still a pretty good movie. I believe that if the movie had been more original then I would have liked it (except for the first person part of the movie wich is why the rating is not higher aside from not being original). Overall as much as I hate to admit it this is a pretty good movie and worth watching (yes this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth) so go ahead and watch it it is by no standard the best video game based movie ever but decent overall.                                SORRY ABOUT MY FIRST REVIEW 
 so bad that i will just say this,read the book night shift and find out what this movie should of and could of been!!! skip this mess! 
 I love the original comic strip by Eric Orner. It is sexy, funny, fizzy and cool.  I don' know if the movie tries too hard or not hard enough but most of it falls flat.  I am a big fan of Dan Letterle and he is the best and only reason to watch the movie.  Everything he says and does rings true.  And he is way sexy too 
 In book two of the Kathy Reichs series involving Temperance Brennan, Tempe finds herself with dead bodies on two continents.  Upon examination, she begins to find unusual similarities that link these deaths.  But how can the victims be so far apart and yet somehow be related?  What evil force is at work here and who can stop it?  And how is a nun's missing niece tied to the destruction?  To top it all off, her eccentric sister from Texas has gone missing in Canada in her quest to "find herself."  Tempe must deal with whether some evil has touched her sister or whether this is just another installment of her sister's flaky personality.  The murders in this book follow Tempe from Montreal to the Carolinas in too far fetched a pattern.  Wherever this woman travels, bodies pop up that no one but her can possibly deal with.  As an anthropologist it is logical that she would find herself dealing with skeletal remains, but it is completely unbelievable to find that as she travels between her two homes that the bodies keep piling up and no one else is available to conduct the investigation.  Again Tempe is a heroine that is difficult to like.  When asked to assist with the deaths she whines internally about how she had other plans and really doesn't want to be bothered.  When she finally relents, she has trouble associating the clues that she sees.  There are terrible lines illustrating this such as "that kindled something...in my memory cells, but when I tried to bring it up the spark went out."  Another: "The mental itch was back.  What was it?  Why couldn't I bring it to the surface?"  Yet 100 pages later she is magically pulling it all together and making extrodinary leaps and bounds toward solving the crimes of the century.  This is my second attempt at Kathy Reichs.  I already own the next two books in the series, so I will read them eventually, but it seems as though this set of novels is a huge disappointment with ridiculous plots and an unlikable heroine 
 I enjoyed "Temple" but this book was just awful.  Reilly's books are full of amazing, improbable but fun action scenes.  You spend a few hours suspending common sense but having a good time.  In this book however there were two elements that were just so bad that they ruined the rest of the adventure.  1) The career Marine captain has a romance with an NCO who reports to him.    and 2)There was a bear family that played a key role in the story - mama bear, baby bear and papa bear.  Right.  The only place you will fine a papa bear in a bear family is in Goldylocks.  Read "Temple" instead 
 Although I am a huge fan of Jo Beverly, this was a disappointment. It is very hard to identify Damaris' finer qualities and start to care about her, so one wonders why Fitz would care. Also, although certainly anyone who reads romance novels cannot be a prude, it does seem a little strange--dare I say forward?--the way Damaris throws herself at Fitz and starts kissing him hotly every time they are alone. Ashart and Genova also seem to take over the book quite a bit. And yet one more quibble--Damaris' family situation turns out to be so bizarre that it just beggars belief (although the Trayce family mystery is quite fun). All in all, not one of Beverly's best 
 So for the most part, people have been giving this book good reviews.  My personal opinion is that the book is terrible.  Part of the problem with books of this nature is that historians don't understand biology, and biologists don't understand history.  Kelly's major fault lies in his understanding of plague's biology.  He suggests that the Black Death may have been the reason for the increased frequency of the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion.  He cites an article from 1998.  I doubt he read the article nor anything about the topic further.  In the original journal article (Stephens, et al., [1998], Am. J. Hum. Gen., 62:1507-1515), the Swedes, at 14%, have the highest frequency of the deletion with the Chinese as the lowest.  The Black Death struck China too, so why do so few people have the deletion there?  This same problem plagues (pun very much intended) Scott & Duncan's work (Biology of Plagues, 2001; Return of the World's Greatest Serial Killer, 2005).  What Kelly fails to miss is the abundance of research that shows that Y. pestis doesn't interact with the chemokine receptors, which would have caused the elevation of frequency (the CCR5-delta32 allele deletion confers protection against AIDS).  This is just one of many faults in his presentation of Y. pestis as the causative agent of the Black Death.  He also plagarizes; see p. 25 of his work and p. 24 of Herlihy's The Black Death and the Transformation of the West 
 While I'm not the type who notes inaccuracies very well, it was the story that bothered me most. Nevermind that many writers these days have serious problems with prose.   I had a very hard time trying to convince myself that a forensic pathologist could be rambling endlessly about "evil". All this with hardly any conscience over having an affair with Benton and sullying his marriage.   Furthermore, Patricia Cornwell pulls out the old trick of "men versus Scarpetta" again. While it was vaguely interesting in the first book or so, this constant reminder is tiring.   Finally, the "conspiracy" part has been beaten to death. It doesn't mean you can't use it though but Patricia employs it to poor effect.   I felt that Cruel and Unusual and The Body Farm were the better books out of this series. I think she has finally worn out her characters and they would've been better laid to rest. 
 I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and  daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it 
 Tropic of Cancer by Henry Miller. Not recommended.  In his 1960 introduction to Tropic of Cancer, Karl Shapiro said, "I call Henry Miller the greatest living author because I think he is," ". . . as a spiritual example he stands among the great men of our age," and ". . . he [Orwell] predicts that Miller will set the pace and attitude for the novelist of the future. This has not happened yet, but I agree that it must." Shapiro does not support any of these points in his essay, and nothing about Tropic of Cancer supports them, either.  Tropic of Cancer consists of 318 pages recounting Miller's experience as an American expatriate in Paris and expounding his personal philosophy, often in ways that are rambling and painfully nonsensical. Miller's stories about his friends are tedious, pointless, and catty; like Miller, they seem to have been talentless hacks whose belief in their own artistic abilities makes them artists and writers, as though believing is being. Miller writes, "A year ago, six months ago, I thought I was an artist. I no longer think about it, I am"--which is the type of arrogant pretentiousness he mocks in virtually all of his acquaintances.  When they are not creating, or talking about philosophy or creating, Miller and his circle seem to spend nearly every moment picking up women (and disease). They rarely use a neutral term such as "woman" when there are so many obscene, demeaning words with which to objectify the gender. The women that Miller and friends find are invariably portrayed as stupid, drunken, irrational, loose, sly, deceptive, and good primarily for one function, which Miller turns into a squalid, cold, joyless act. In spite of all the vice and the "living," no one seems to be having fun, and some characters, notably Fillmore, find themselves nearly trapped into the bourgeoisie life.  Miller expresses contempt for the machine, the industrial age, and money--although he schemes to keep 2,800 francs from Fillmore's mistress and revels in having so much in his pocket. Often hungry, Miller obsesses about food and relies on his friends to support him. When he describes his Indian friend Kepi as ". . . a scrounger, a sort of human tick who fastens himself to the hide of even the poorest compatriot," he could be talking about himself as he bitterly complains about those of his friends who are stingy with money, accommodations, food, and wine.  Miller's logic about the working world is facile; he writes, "If you want bread, you've got to get in harness, get in lockstep." On the surface, this is true, but it never seems to occur to him that, if you want bread, someone must cultivate, raise, and harvest the wheat and produce the other components; someone must transform these components into bread; and someone must deliver it to the shops and cafes. In other words, if most people weren't in "lock step," Miller could choose to starve or set himself to produce bread, joining the world in harness. He makes his choice clear, then whines about it. He may despise those who support him, whether they are friends or workers, but that is perhaps because he, a misanthrope who finds fault with everyone but himself, needs the very people he denigrates (including "the grocer, the baker, the shoemaker, the butcher, etc.--all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers"), a reliance which he resents. He hates the machine and the machine mind, but offers no alternatives.  Seemingly incapable of sincere feeling, Miller finds human emotion amusing. When a friend says, "A boy can break your heart . . . He's so damned beautiful! And so cruel!" Miller writes, "We had to laugh at this. It sounded preposterous. But Collins was in earnest." When an acquaintance to whom he owes money dies, he writes, "At any rate, he was killed in an automobile accident shortly after my arrival, a circumstance which left me twenty-three francs to the good."  Shapiro claims that Miller is a poet, but his attempts at poetic and philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense. Speaking of buildings and statues, Miller says, " . . . they must be saturated with my anguish," the kind of bad metaphor in which he frequently indulges. He describes artists such as himself as the "inhuman ones." "I am inhuman! I say it with a mad, hallucinated grin, and I will keep on saying it though it rain crocodiles. Behind my words are all those grinning, leering, skulking skulls, some dead and grinning a long time, some grinning as if they had lockjaw, some grinning with the grimace of a grin, the foretaste and aftermath of what is always going on." Whenever these attempts at poetic philosophy appeared, rambling on for pages, I found myself yearning for a return to his insipid stories about prostitutes, disease, friends, and hunger.  Tropic of Cancer is perhaps the worst book I have ever read (and I did promise myself that I would read Tropic of Capricorn). Shapiro says, "There are not many of these emancipated beings left in our world [emancipated from what? --DLS], these clowns and clairvoyants, celebrants of the soul and of the flesh and of the still-remaining promise of America." If Miller, with his whining, his criticism, his holier-than-everyone attitude, his "art," his two-dimensional view of people, and his obsession with excrement, is the "greatest" of these souls, may I never meet the least.  Note: If there were a 0 stars option, Tropic of Cancer would have earned it 
 Schaeffer's work, Escape From Reason, leaves much to be desired in the way of 'penetrating' thought. Quite honestly, he doesn't leave room for thought of any kind.  This book reads like the Christian version of "Final Exit," reeking of the nihilistic determinism of death, though in the first half of the book, he blames everybody and everything for the "theological shift," he claims, that has occurred. Countless times, (I gave up trying to count them all), he parlays that knowledge is by revelation ONLY, that reason is the cause for all of man's problems and difficulties; a conclusion which is patently false, because as the Bible states, sin is the cause of all of man's problems.  He engages in a fallacial logical argument, where he negates at predicate twice to call it identity. For instance, instead of A is A as identity... He says that A is NOT Non-A. The statement A-> ~(~A) is false when using quantitative reasoning, something to which Schaeffer objects.  As a Christian, I was outright offended by the statement he makes, that unless you have the content of the meaning of the name of Christ that the people of the Reformation had, then Christ's name is meaningless, or so says Schaeffer. I also found that many questions I had while reading this were not answered, and some altogether avoided:   If knowledge (wisdom, intelligence) is only gained by revelation, and only the select few are entitled to that revelation, should the rest of us remain ignorant? Schaeffer would say yes.   If reason is so bad for man, why is anti-reason not the answer either?   He goes through the line, Nature is bad, the principle of mechanics is bad, humanism is bad, freedom is bad, which would lead to the conclusion that intelligence is bad.   He asks the question, "How can unity exist when differences in thinking exist," to which I initially and facetiously replied "Marriage."  In his analysis of the Renaissance, he faults Thomas Aquinas for what he believes is the introduction of "humanism" into the doctrines of the church. Then he faults Leonardo da Vinci for Neo-platonist tendencies in Leo's works. "Curse those inventions of Leo's mind," Schaeffer seems to say. The list could go on and on, but it occurs to me that the only theophilologer to which Schaeffer completely defends is Immanuel Kant, whose whole premise was that reason should be completely abandoned for man to survive, and then so what if he doesn't.   So what Schaeffer really believes is that we should abdicate our minds, that things like this review have to be knowledge anomalies; that Christians are designed to be dumb and solfidious, (Justification by Faith Alone). Even when he clings to the existentialism of Karl Barth, Jean-Paul Sartre, (and Camus), he is forced to admit that his theory needs help from humanism, or else mankind has no redeeming value to himself or to God, (determinism, or in Christian circles, nihilistic pre-destination). It reminded me of the song, "Gloom, Despair, and Agony on Me."  Perhaps he should have read James 2:18, "I have faith and you have works; show me your faith, and I will show you my faith by my works."  Unfortunately for Schaeffer, works would require that man know how to do things, a concept called intelligence and learning.   This is ultimately a terrible book, offering no new thoughts or solutions, (how could he? the solutions have to be THOUGHT out.) to the continuing predicament in Christianity 
 Dont purchase episode 5 of season 2, it's 7 minutes long and you dont get any of the Charlie Murphy Prince story.  WTF!!!  Can someone fix this and refund or offer the entire episode for re-download!!! 
 Paint doesnt load or expel easily...waste of money and time...my daughter is happier with a bucket of plain water and a brus 
 i love easy reading mysteries....this book and author has all the potential but disappointed me with "blue" words, and sex scenes that really didn't need to be put in..i was very sad that it was in the story line...i won't buy the series...too bad i loved the idea of the character's skill in aromatherap 
 Dancing in the hype. This book is all fluff - there is not any real truth to grasp. Don't waste your money - or the quick click on amazon will be a regret. And will you really take the time to send it back 
 Not all that useful, really.  Message is "buy mutual funds!".  In general, since the vast majority of mutual funds underperform the market, just buy index funds would be the best advice.  Most of the text is entirely useless to someone who might want to trade individual stocks.  Passages suggest that if a company seems undervalued you might want to have lunch with the CEO to go over the financials and confirm your valuation.  Oh, thanks Peter, what great advice... ("Mr. Gates, your 11 o'clock is here to discuss purchasing 15 shares") 
 If you want to converse about argument, debate, shared insight, sophistry, truth, beauty, and the American way, etc., don't bother with this dreck. Just read any Platonic dialogue 
 Why????  Why must sequals always be so bad, especially when you get to something like a #4 in a series.  There is nothing good about Bloodsport 4 except the couple of fights.  The acting is so bad that its hard to enjoy this.  High school students could act this one out much better.  What's with Daniel Bernhardt?  He's not playing Alex Cardo anymore but a cop named John Keller.  Apparently, Keller's character calls for bad acting because Bernhardt sure provides it.  He did so much better as Alex in Bloodsport's 2 & 3.  But in Bloodsport 4, everyone else still can't act 1/2 as good as Bernhardt in the movie.  Yep, its that bad.    Ok, so the acting stinks.  The story does too.  There is no in depth to this movie at all, no surprise, no twists, nothing.  The only thing that gets 2 stars for this movie is the fights.  There are several, actually pretty decent.  Compared to the first 3 Bloodsports, the kumite is dissapointing.  After 30 minutes of fights in the first Bloodsports, filled with lots of fighters with tons of techniques and styles, Bloodsport 4's kumite is a let down.  To be honest, its not even a real kumite.  Compared to some movies, they are good fights, don't get me wrong, but again compared to the first 3 Bloodsport movies, its a let down.  The villain is one of the only cool character in the movie, played by Stefanos Miltsakakis (who also appeared as a fighter in Best of The Best 2 and in a few Van Damme movies).  The other decent guy is a semi-villain fighter, played by David Rowe (an extremely cut fighter).  Keller and Schrek (Miltsakakis) get the final fight in the kumite,which lasts for only a few moments.  The fights is all this is honestly good for.  I'll still watch Bloodsport 4...when I get tired of watching the 100 other martial arts movies I own 
 I purchased this item for my son's birthday.  Not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it.  Also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly.  After a couple of  days we were able to accomplish only one 2 min. successful flight.    On the second day, after 15 mins of recharging the battery, the battery case and wires melted.  Have contacted company for a refund.  
 This book is written from the standpoint of a Philidelpia coroner's office intern, who obviously has never been exposed to cable television.  While it was a fast read and interesting, it was very basic in the level of forensics it described.  If you have watched any forensic television in the past, this is not the book for you.  I hope that in the future, Mr. Temple would go a bit deeper, including not well known forensics to teach the reader a few things.  There were interesting side plots about the acting deputy coroners in the office and some of the office politics, but all in all I felt disappointed to spend so much on a very short book that offered no new insights 
 Someone's trying to kill Soap star Mary Lisa Beverly, and how I wish they'd succeeded. This book doesn't do either the mystery or romanance genres justice, and thread throughout is a lame shooting report from the set of the soap whose title forms the title of the book. Does anybody care that Mary Lisa's character in the soap meets her long-believed dead father? What does this have to do with the death plot? And what's a small town cop from Oregon doing stepping into an investigation in California? The book explains Mary Lisa's father and a rejected lover both asked him to, but Jack Wolf's got his own murder to sleuth, so what's he doing in Oregon, other than making eyes at our heroine. Much of the book centers on flirting between the Oregon sheriff and Mary Lisa, stuff that has little to do with the plot and indeed detracts from it, and the book is in serious need of an editor. At one place, Mary Lisa refers to the "Sheik of Aran." Argh!  This is one to skip. Generally a good writer, Catherine Coulter must have pulled this one out of the rejected pile. It should be thrown back 
 I am currently reading this book and came on here because I spotted several errors in the text and wanted to see if anyone else had noticed this.  I totally agree with a previous review that says the numerous errors will make you question everything.  It is an interesting read, but it is just unforgiveable that even obvious things like plot points in films, casting, etc. are wrong.  I noticed a few and let them go, thinking that I must be the one that was wrong.  As it went on I thought wait a minute and started checking things out only to find that, in fact, they were wrong!  Bad enough that the writer is irresponsible, but wasn't there a fact checker around?!  As the other poster stated, when facts that are obvious and easily checked are wrong, it kind of ruins the readers experience and does have you wonder what else might be false. Inexcuseable 
 I really wanted to read this book.  I've read a lot about the Nazi persecution of Jews, as well as their persecution of Russians, Slavs, homosexuals, anarchists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and so on.  But I hadn't read much about their persecution of the Roma, or Gypsies, and I wanted to learn about it. But the book is extraordinarily dry.  The author did not bring the events to life at all. It's pretty hard to make a subject as inherently dramatic as the systematic persecution of an entire people not very interesting, but the author succeeded.  What's worse, really, was that as other reviewers suggested, there was a powerful theme of underplaying the importance of what happened to the Roma. I was very disturbed by this. I give the book two stars instead of one because I did learn a few things. But I will be looking for another book on the subject, because I didn't learn enough 
 I ordered this table based on the reviews I read and boy I will never do that again.  This table is such poor quality and is NOT worth the money.  I am so disappointed in it that I shoved it in a corner where no one can see it and put a plant on it. It is not a sturdy table so if you are looking for something that holds up this is not one to buy.  I would say this table is worth $20 and no more........... 
 I was prepared to like this book, especially after the rave reviews found here on Amazon, and Audible. But I found that Haunted Ground: A novel, quickly lost my interest. Why, you may ask? Because the author has too many characters and she head-hops between them constantly. Each section is narrated by a new character, and frankly I lost interest. I prefer books with one, possibly two voices but not a half dozen. This is particularly disconcerting in audio format. Plus, I found the drippy American character with the tortured past and murdered sister a bit trite and maudlin.   Feh, overall, 2 stars. If she had stuck to a single or maybe dual perspective it might've captured my interest 
  I find it fascinating how often members of both sides of the evolution-creation argument accuse each other of some kind of questionable practice - whilst doing exactly the same thing themselves.  The credibility of this book can be gauged right from the start of the first chapter - by the arguments presented by an evolutionist who is pulling exactly the kind of stunts that evolutionists most hate (and quite reasonably so) when such actions are being carried out by creationists.  First the author uses a passage from the work of Henry Morris as though it faithfully represented the views of ALL those who prefer a creationist explanation of the origins of mankind.  Secondly the author fails to distinguish between "fundamentalist", "creationist" and "literalist", drawing the assumption, for example, that all fundamentalists are literalists as far as interpreting the contents of the Bible is concerned. This is categorically NOT true - as illustrated all the way back in 1925 when William Jennings Bryan (a renowned fundamentalist but NOT a literalist) explained, in the course of the trial of John Scopes, that he believed in the literal truth of the Bible, but ONLY insofar as it was meant to be taken literally.  Next the author makes an unjustified leap - from saying that evolutionism (from a creationist viewpoint) "may be because of the Devil" (page 1) to the extremist claim that "scientific creationism" is seen by its adherents as "a battle between Good and Evil" and that "either you are for God, or on the side of the Devil" (page 2).  So, in the space of just about one full page of text, the author selected to "open the batting" has indulged in the three cardinal sins so often ascribed to creationists:   - Quote mining  - Misuse of technical terms  - Building straw men as a basis for repudiating the case made by the people you are criticising.  Please note, I am not for one moment denying that "some" creationists may be in complete agreement with Dr. Morris' views; "some" creationists definitely do indulge in quote mining; "some" creationists do misuse (deliberately or through ignorance) technical terms and definitions relating to evolution; and "some" creationists definitely do base their arguments on "straw men" because they are so much easier to demolish than confronting the "facts".  But NOT all of them. Contrary to the implication made by this author, and throughout most of the book, creationists are a diverse lot and definitely not a neatly self-contained, homogenous group which can be written off with a few supercilious side swipes. Nor is it true that ONLY "scientific creationists" (or any other religion-oriented groups/individuals) have criticisms of the supposedly "scientific" evidence used to support evolutionist claims.  (See, for example, "Shattering the Myths of Darwinism", by Richard Milton, a science journalist and evolutionist with NO religious affiliations.)  In a nutshell, "Scientists Confronting Creationism" is preaching strictly to the "converted" whilst adding little or nothing to a genuinely informed and useful debate.  
 Do not under any circumstances read this book. I love Catherine Coulter and think her books are wonderful but was sadly disapointed with the Valentine Legacy. The caracters are boring, there is absolutly no romance and no sparks between James and Jesse and it makes for a very long and boring book 
 Admittedly, my interest in Maile Meloy initially came entirely from my enjoyment of her younger brother Colin Meloy's band, the Decemberists.  Meloy's debut short story collection is extremely promising in a lot of key areas: her stories have a strong sense of place, and she's got both a good ear for dialogue and a strong handle on narrative pacing.  Things actually happen in these stories, in other words, something that can't always be said about similar short story collections.  However, it seems that Colin inherited all of the family's sense of humor genes, as Maile's stories are almost relentlessly bleak and often downright depressing.  A wider variety of emotional shadings would go a long way towards enhancing this collection 
 My roommate gave me this book and I thought it would be a good read during the winter break (I am a college student).  Halfway through chapter 2 (pg 18) I decided to stop reading the book. The book can be summarized by saying that we human make decisions based on feeling and not logic. This book explains why is that. But it doesn't teach you how to become more logical 
 This was required reading for my British Literature class. It's the only novel in the class that I struggled with and only struggled from boredom. It is entirely possible that I just do not understand the genius that is Forster, but I did not enjoy this novel. A lover of Forster or Modernist writing might enjoy it more. It must be a classic for a reason. 
 The 1997 Sounds True cassette tape version is so much better than this watered-down, tired-sounding CD and book. After using the taped version, which has four longish guided meditations and is so inspiring and helpful, the very brief guidance for the meditations on the CD version gives the impression that the author became bored or burnt out with teaching. I will continue to use the the cassette tapes and will throw out the more recent CD and book. 
 Thanks to all of you for the input!  I was interested in this product as a x-mas present for my parents...great price and liked the fact that it was 5.8ghz... however, because of your reveiws I will be going elsewhere.  Thanks again! 
 I bought this book thinking that the "secrets" therein would enlighten me as to things we might be missing in our planning for retirement.  The other reviewers on this site made it sound like the book would have advice on little-known health care deals, finding a good place to live, etc.  Instead, it is filled with common sense tips, such as "enjoy sex" and "learn to forgive."  Gee, thanks.  This might be a good book if you're retired and bored, but don't buy this looking for much more. 
 I heard about this book and unfortunately bought it before I could read the reviews here. I didn't know a book could be boring and over-the-top at the same time. Her descriptions of the punishments are so ludicrous and repetitive, that I found myself skipping them over. Beauty seems to have no personality or thought processes and the end is utterly confusing. All that said, I want to find out what happens in the next book! I just don't want to spend money on it! Hopefully I can find it in the library, although I doubt it 
 This book was suspenseful at first, but soon became a "video game". Every corner turned was a new problem or a "monster". The book soon devolved into a trip down Christian Land. In the end, I feel like I was beat over the head with a Watch Tower 
 I was so excited to try this "amazing-hyped" shampoo,I bought the kit from QVC.All I can say is what a disaster.My hair which is coarse,it instantly turned to straw. No lather,horrible tangles,the conditioner did not help at all (left it on for 10-15 min).I also contacted Jonathan Procduct,Inc(4) times and left messages for them to please call me to discuss the problem with their product. NO RESPONSE! All Hype-No Action! Don't waste your money. $60 is alot to pay for itchy dry hair.If you look in beauty supply stores there are other brands that are sulfate-free also, such as Mastey(Code Red 
 Incredibly dull "hard SF" novel reads more like a soap opera set in the nail-bitingly-intense world of academia. Skip it 
 The fellow who coined the phrase "secular humanism" is not about to embrace the full nature of the internet.  It would naturally be anathema to him, just as he prized Blake but damned Wordsworth.  Roszak is the most Aristotelian of extreme-romance writers.  I wish he would take up another hobby 
 sales rank says it al 
 I got this CD for my mom and after listening to it she asked me to take it back to the store, because she said there is no way it could be her favorite singer Engelbert. She was very disapointed. So I am stocked with this because the store would not take it back. Does anyone want it for free? 
 I picked up this book because I've read two other books by Anne Tyler that I greatly enjoyed, but I was disappointed by this one.  Maybe it was written before she really hit her stride as a writer.  While entertaining,  the book seemed somewhat empty.  I didn't find the characters' actions very  believable, and the "surprise" ending did not follow from  anything earlier in the book (as all really good surprise endings should).   The virtue of this book is that it can be quickly read in one evening.  I  do recommend Tyler's books "A Patchwork Planet" and "Earthly  Posessions.&quot 
 I am fascinated with this machine.   It has incredible detail although it lacks a little lattitude and details are lost as soon as there are some shadows.  The battery so far usually lasts me the whole day when I go touring.   If I take care to shut the display down as soon as I dont need it anymore I find that when I am on a cruise ship or visiting another country I can take all the movies I usually want - - and recharge when I get back to my room at night.   The only problem is playback on a TV or PC.   The bundled software made by ULEAD is not user friendly and, whereas the previous Xacti I had played back images and video clips in the order I had taken, this one separates  them and plays back either clips or images.   Before I played back through my Panasonic Hard Disk DVD recorder and recorded a DVD directly.   Now I have to go into my PC and do a whole lot of editing and so far the "Movie FActory" program keeps crashing.  I imagine somebody will eventually suggest a better software program, or I will learn to use Ulead, but for the time being the pictures and clips Ihave taken have very good detail, and the machine has operated flawlessly. 
 While I adore YA novels about queer kids, this one left me a little underwhelmed.  I was just never convinced that Lissa and Kate were real people --- the character development was nil.  I also didn't believe that they actually felt something for one another --- it was kind of like a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, where all of the ingredients for a romantic comedy are there, but there's just no chemistry; it's not convincing.  For a really good read, rely on the old classic Annie On My Mind --- a book which I still practically keep under my pillow, and which convinced my mom (!) that maybe, maybe this lesbian thing was OK 
 The oral history approach by Ambrose & Co offers certainly has its attraction. And if this book would have consisted of personal accounts of D-Day veterans only, I think it would have made a valuable, insightful, and memorable account of this landmark battle.   Unfortunately, the author did not leave it at that but felt the need to present his own, highly biased and overly patriottic views on the various aspects of the battle. The message that is spelled out again and again, in capitals, is that only the American troops and their commanders showed excellence in planning and carrying out the battle. Their allies, in particular the British, receive considerably less credit or even scorn. For example, the book ridicules the supposed British craze for "gadgets", such as their mini-submarines and special tanks, which they nonetheless used very effectively on D-day.   But what really annoys me is the personal "battle" that Ambrose seems to be fighting with the long-beaten German foe: all the decisions they took on D-day were wrong in his opinion, they responded way too late or not at all, they failed to foresee the invasion, their command structure was inadequate, their navy did not intercept the fleet "which nobody could understand", etc. etc. The truth is that by june 1944 the Germans simply did not have the resources to fight an agressive and intelligent counter-battle on the Western front anymore. I find it disappointing, a little cheap and certainly inappropriate for a scholarly historian to keep on criticizing the past performance of an enemy with the comforts of hindsight and imaginary resources. (Even more so as the included number of German combattants' accounts in this book is less than a handful.)   By the end of this book, I was thoroughly fed up with the hollow rhetorics and "easy" truths like "The Wehrmacht's many mistakes [on D-day] were exceeded by those of the Luftwaffe, which was quite simply just not there" (ch 32). Perhaps this style is what it takes to write a bestseller, but "D Day: June 6, 1944" fails as a military history book. 
 Nelly eats so much of his own poo its disgustin 
 I was excited to locate a book that targeted exactly what I was trying to achieve.  Medical Billing Marketing.  Not just marketing, but Marketing for my business.  So I ordered it, even paid the extra $10 to get it here STAT!    Once I got it it appeared to be an owners manual of some sort...but "dont judge a book by its cover"  Once I opened it, I began to read, many of the Only 33 pages on marketing. The information was redundant, and spent telling you how a doctoers office works???  Than not to follow up with prospects????  Than to just walk in drop a card, and hope that someone remebers its around if they are ever in the market?????  That was the worst sales/marketing advice I have ever been given!  Finally hitting home the newest concept of Electronic billing, which is not new in my neck of the woods.  So also outdated!    The next 10 or so pages are a glossery of very basic terms we should all be aclimated with.    The final pages are them trying to sell you more informative products..  In short, go to your local bookstore and find the book, "Making Friends with Big Bird and the Sesame Street Gang"  It will be more informative, and you can also share it wioth the kids!      
 The labels are fine and dandy, but the software that comes with them is horrid. Not only did the calibration page not print, but there is no way to pre-size an image to a desired resolution (so I can enhance the enlarged image). Also, what did print ended up looking grainy. In the end, I had to appropriately resize and print my own images, adding white borders to the left and top edges to get it to center on the label 
 Laptop Mag can be best described negatively: it's not a really serious computer magazine.  It's more or less like Consumer Guide, which is basically paid advertising.  This means you can't really trust the article here because you don't know if they are not written by unbiased writers.  In the end, I feel this is a waste of money.  Besides, you can get all the info for free on the web, from CNET or ZDNET, anyway 
 This 1009-paged law school casebook is more like an anthology, wherein the collected works overlap with redundant content.  Having read the book twice now, cover-to-cover, it has become clear that the authors are more concerned about proving themselves to the legal community than writing a student-oriented casebook.  Contributing to the repetitiveness seems to be the authors' knack for turning simple concepts into entire chapter sections all the while managing to continue a self-important attitude.  Indeed, the arrogance is displayed throughout.  An often repeated phrase is "one of the authors of this case book..."  Meanwhile, the authors add full law review articles that contribute little to the subject matter.  Fortunately, the authors do give credit where credit is due by citing in bold the authors of those articles-themselves.  All of this and more makes for a poor read.  Suffice to say, the authors on this book know little about the meaning of being concise.  Readers are fortunate that they did manage to cut 361 pages from their prior edition.  One author recently stated that the next edition will be a full 400 pages shorter, which gives one an idea of the present, unnecessary content.  This casebook series is simply in too desperate need of an objective editor to be educational.  I strongly recommend that professors, students, and casual readers alike look to other sources of information, such as the equally-priced University Casebook Series 
 I watched the movie hoping it was one of those good 'no guns, no car crash' movies from both Farrell and Hayek; but turned out to be a bad choice. The story is extremely fictional (says a Mexican woman living in the United States) and I know the time period was different, but no woman gets over or forgives such strong racist insults from an Italian man who wants to be white. The characters were not integral throughout the movie, and please.. no one has ever died from too much smoking marijuana; and Mexicans do other drugs as well. Bad stereotypes, bad performances, bad actors. Some pretty images, but at a very high price 
 "Saints, Saviors, and Sinners" is another meek attempt by ESPN/Disney to use their brand name in an effort to coerce the buyer into purchasing something, simply because the ESPN name is on it.  I found the book to be lacking in content, and uninteresting overall.  I received the book as a Christmas gift in 2003, and have read about six pages in it.  Certainly not worth the $40.00 cover price.  If you want a decent book profiling sportsmen, pick up one of Sports Illustrated's year-end books. 
 I just watched (actually by fast forwarding) "The Legend 2" and another Jet Li starrer called "Red Dragon" (not to be confused with the Hannibal/Anthony Hopkins movie of the same name) and I implore you to not waste a second of your precious time or a dime of your money on this so called martial arts crap, chinese style. First and foremost dubbing of any of these movies takes out the authentic flavor out of the original making the comedy, villiany, romance and any other kind of human emotion sound, look and feel pathetically lame. That's the big and only difference between these 'B'grade action movies from Honkong and a slicker production like "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" (slicker only, read my review of CTHD for details on that fiasco). This is no serious martial art and the comedy like those innumerable chinese martial art movies, SUCKS. I can only give some credit for the flexible acrobatics. If you wish to watch sensible Jet Li action check out his Holywood movies. 
  There are just too many errors ,of interpretation,omission and commission,in this book to justify purchasing it.In this review we will concentrate on Rima's(R)handling of the work of J M Keynes.On p.84,R's claim that the Physiocratic concept of hoarding is "surprisingly suggestive" of J M Keynes's idea has no supporting evidence to back it up.On p.133,R claims that Malthus had developed a principle of effective demand,a la Keynes.What Malthus expressed was an uneasy feeling and/or intuition that Ricardo's deductive,analytical system of market self adjustment to a global optimum was overlooking(or assuming away)the possibility of insufficient aggregate spending.Nowhere does Malthus ever systematically present a theoretical counter to Ricardo.What Malthus does is express some reservations in an exchange of postal letters with Ricardo.In chapter 20 of R's book, she attempts to deal with Keynes's theory of effective demand and Keynes's discussion of involuntary unemployment which follows directly from his theory.Keynes worked out the mathematical details in his chapter 20,titled "The Employment Function".R should have simply reprinted that chapter in her book,replacing her chapter 20 with Keynes's chapter 20.R's Figure 20.1,discussed on pages451-454,directly contradicts Keynes's analysis 
 People buy this book thinking that they will get great advice about how to become a bookie.  What kind of advice you get? None, unless you consider advice not to take the phone calls at your home, or how to fill a piece of paper with the information. It seems that this guy have not heard of spredsheets.   Anyway, the worst of all, is that he tells you basically that you should not worry because people only take favorites and you will make tons of money because underdogs are not taken into account by the bettor.  I agree that in certain sports  like football there is a bias towards favorites, but if you take the data the underdog cover about 52% (or the favorite 48% ATS). This guy talks like 90% of the people bets on the favorite. But even if that it is the case, if the remaining 10% are wiseguys with a huge bankroll your days as a bookie will be counted.  By the way, unless you lived outside the US, his advice not only could make lose money but you could end up in jail!  Do not waste your money on this 
 My kids and I have much enjoyed this recording, but the narration is often too quiet and sounds a bit muffled.  Moreover, the narrator speaks with a British accent, making comprehension a bit trickier for little ones.  In general, I have missed the sound quality obtained in digital recordings, so I'm now shopping for a better recording of this wonderful piece of music 
 After reading this book I am still confused about the author's intent.  On the book cover's back flap he states, "Above all, The Other Man is a testament to the enduring power of love and a story about painful choices we make with our all-too-human hearts."  I must agree with the part about painful choices because he made some painful ones when he agreed to be the other man.  Why would he try to compete with John Kennedy Jr.?    I don't agree with him stating that this book is a testament of love.  If so, why did he paint Carolyn Bessette Kennedy so negatively?  This book trashes her image, character and morals.  Michael Bergin tells of lustful sex, drugs, infidelity, lies and a possible abortion.  Yes, it is his personal story of a season in his life and he has a right to tell it, but don't mislead the readers.  Despite my feeling mislead and still questioning his intent, overall the book was well put together.  The book contains many full page photos, some of which validate that he did in fact know Carolyn and did some modeling.  If you are a true fan of Carolyn and/or John Kennedy Jr. this book is not for you.  If you are one to have a curious nature about the lives of the above mentioned people then you will enjoy this book 
 Started reading it and put it down three times, just couldn't hold my interest 
 I ordered this same cartridge in June and paid $13.68. It was a good price and I was happy with the product. When I went to reorder today, it was $18.40. It went up almost $5.00 for the same cartridge in 3 months. I think I'll check out my local office supply store instead. They still sell it for about $14.50 
 It's a good idea to find out what financiers like George Soros are thinking because it may give some hints of what is in our future.  His book, "The Crisis of Global Capitalism" was rushed into print "at breakneck speed." That should give a hint about Soros' power and influence.   Soros, once a Hungarian Jewish refugee, is now a big shot.  When he isn't masterminding international financial scams or working toward world government, he makes public appearances, testifies before Congress, and writes books.  The stimulus for the book was the global financial crisis that began in Thailand in July 1997. The crisis steamrolled through the economies of many nations, collapsing the Russian banking system before the recovery began.  Malaysia shut down its financial markets to foreigners, pointing to Soros as the source of the problem.  After that close brush with global economic meltdown, perhaps Soros is trying to convince us that we should create a mechanism to clean up after his meddling.  Soros' "remedy" is international supervision over the national authorities.  World government.  How much world government is enough? "You cannot have a common market without a common currency. You cannot have a common currency without a common fiscal policy, including some kind of centralized tax collection."  And of course he says we need the International Criminal Court.  Still not enough world government for you?    "A society without social values cannot survive and a global society needs universal values to hold it together." In case you missed it, we are talking about a global religion.  Maybe world government is like sex--you can't be a little bit pregnant, and you can't have a little bit of global government.  Soros clouds the issue with a lot of talk about "open societies," although world government would be anything but that.  Soros touts democracy and open societies, but he obviously favors bureaucratic secrecy over an open society. Soros favors some type of powerful paternalistic oligarchy that falls somewhat short of actual totalitarianism-or better yet, makes people think that it stops short of totalitarianism.  This book is loaded with contradictions.  Soros' definition of an open society diametrically opposes his desired stable society.  Soros calls Communism a cure worse than the disease, yet he maintains that we must put common interest ahead of self-interest.  He says that the US can't go it alone, yet somehow the US can save the world.    Soros is too dishonest to admit that pumping capital from advanced nations to the third world will lower US living standards, although he predicts that the US will have to dismantle the social safety net to become more competitive.  Soros decries the profit motive as the basis of human behavior, but what other motive is there for international capital flight and destroying national sovereignty?    What does internationalism deliver?  If you look at the US in the age of internationalism, then the answer is war, low wages, unemployment, and loss of self-reliance.  The fact is, free movement of capital is a relatively recent phenomenon. At the end of the Second World War, economies were largely national in character. Since 1980, the balance has swung so far in favor of financial capital that multinational corporations and international financial markets have supplanted national sovereignty. The ability of a nation to provide for the welfare of its citizens has been impaired by the ability of capital to escape paying taxation and decent wages by moving elsewhere.  Regarding the 1977 financial crisis that sparked this book, the international financial system itself constituted the main ingredient in the meltdown process.  The big difference with China was that its currency is not convertible; otherwise it's economy would have been exposed to the "wrecking ball," as Soros puts it.  The countries that kept their financial markets closed weathered the storm better than those that were open.  India was less affected than the Southeast Asian countries; China was better insulated than Korea. 
 I was quite disappointed to find this "book"--pamphlet-sized, large fonts spreading out over sixty plus pages, roughly a paragraph per page--living up to its title. It is really no more than a glorified lecture from an established philosopher who, it would seem, has become big enough to pull a con job on his readers. In the end, Frankfurt takes all this time to reach the conclusion that BS is different from lying, in my opinion hardly worth the paper it's printed on. All in all, an inconsequential and not very entertaining analytical exercise by an emeritus academic with too much time on his hands. If you want to read a work that lives up to being called "entertaining" and "enlightening" you could try "From Lowbrow to Nobrow" (2006).     
 I'm puking my guts out and all she has to say is avoid smells and try different foods.  The only thing that has done for me is now I puke up different foods.  First of all, the title makes you think that you can get rid of your morning sickness, which is totally false.  I didn't find anything in the book that helped me.  Also, it left some of my key questions unanswered such as: Are there things other than diet that can help?  At what point should I call my doctor?  How long is this living hell going to last?  And lastly, a few additional words of comfort would have been appreciated, rather than the chapter on all the women who spent 9 months hospitalized for this, and this is written as a success story because they were able to cope with it.  Come on.. 
 I think someone forgot to tell Molotov that Rap-Metal/Rock-Rap was Dead. Had potential, but the simple riffage and annoying rapping killed it for me 
 I was forced to buy and read this book for an American History class and I KNOW some may say that I am biased because I was required to read this book, but I must say, it is absolutly horrible. As a journalism major I found this book very hard to read. Every chapter talks about the same thing.  The delegates can't decide on anything, everything is based on property and nothing is resolved. (well, until the end, obviously) Perhaps that is how the real constitutional convention happened, but i don't need to read the same thing over and over for 200 pages. Often, the author side tracks on little tid bits of personal information about the delegates that seem totally unrealted to the story at the time. Unless you are a seventy year old man, I don't think you will find this book interesting at all 
 I heard an interview with Dr. Kushner on NPR today.  He explained how the comfort in the 23rd Psalm lies in the realization that, for example, God is not on the side of the terrorists, or the hurricanes; he is on our side.  Why define the world as divided so in the first place?  Terrorists are people too.  Nature is people too.  Until we accept the fact that God is in all of us, we will continue to place things in "good" and "evil" bins and only strengthen the hatred and suffering in the world.  Our comfort and relief from Psalm 23 will only revitalize us to more intensely resist those things that we (WE, not God or some divine law of the universe) label as evil.  I rate the book 2 stars instead of 1 because it is clear the author means well and has a heart of gold, full of compassion.  Unfortunately his wonderful intentions are sorely misguided. 
 I purchased this book hoping to expand on what I already know about Enoch, a biblical character I both admire and am intrigued by.  Instead I found it to be extremely repetitive and propogandistic.  The author was more concerned with making racial claims than with providing an interesting and fulfilling portrait of a great profit.  Unless you are the type who is obsessed with the color of biblical characters I do not recommend this book 
 This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks.  This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one.  A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel.  As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference.  [... 
 In my opinion, this is one of the worst things Reba has ever done.  Most of the songs are the typical pop flavored stuff that country music has become these days.  Its too bad and its an irony too because back in the 1980s she revitalized the traditionalist movement along with George Strait and Ricky Skaggs.  Why did she change??  To record stuff like this???  Awful 
 What a beautiful, godly message of self-respect for young women.  The analogy of two identical apples entrusted to two sisters to be kept for the rightful owner should have encouraged girls to resist sex before marriage and guard themselves for the wonderful man that God has for them. Instead it smacks of nighttime drama - sort of like an episode of "Dynasty."    One apple was overexposed, handled and caused to rot due to a careless bite taken by a man for whom the apple was not intended and did not belong.  The other apple was wisely hidden and protected so it stayed fresh and lovely.  With a stunning lack of sensitivity, the sister who is blonde, beautiful, fun-loving, and cheerful, must also be the self-centered, vain fool who lacks good judgement and integrity.  It follows that her apple rots.  As totally expected, the plain sister must have dark hair, be serious by nature and favored by her parents. She has the misfortune of being overlooked and undervalued.  But, stereotypically, her shining character makes up for her lack of beauty and vivaciousness.  Although she lacks charm and confidence, her care of the apple wins her the marriage proposal of the handsome, manly and discerning prince.    She is chosen - not for being attractive in her own right, but for her sterling character.  The blonde, pretty, but unworthy sister flees the scene in tears.  Although full of remorse for her mistakes, she is out of luck.  She is only mentioned again for having the ability to overcome her jealousy of her sister's good fortune.  Why is it necessary to equate beauty with badness and uglyness with goodness?  Why did they have to be sisters?  The contrast only makes God look unjust to both and unforgiving of the "loser."  Why will my daugters never read this book?  You guessed it.  Their looks and personality mirror the sisters in this fairytale.  Does that make one foolish and other wise?  Of course not.  I am tired of the same old yarn about the pretty blonde only being valued for her looks, (because it stands to reason that she stinks inside).  I am even more sickened by the assumption that the "plain" girl is destined to live in the shadow of her sister, fighting despair and hopelessness because her only value is her good heart.    Isn't beauty in the eye of the beholder, anyway?  Why confirm the Hollywood perversion of beauty?  It is detrimental to the self-esteem of both girls.  I will find another way to honor the attributes of my daughters without comparing them to one another.  This story, in effect, illustrates that they are both, for differing reasons, inferior to each other.  In addition they are each, at least partly, undesirable to their future husbands. (Neither one is the whole package - pursued for having godly character and God-given sex appeal.)  I love all of Lisa's novels.  Needless to say, I am furious that I wasted my hopes and money on this one.  This storybook won't even be donated to the library.  I have already slipped into the trash.  Suzann

 Like everything in the world, this coffee maker is lawyer approved. In other words it does not get hot enough to cause any harm. Unfortunately one minute after poring it is not hot enough to be considered a good cup of coffee.   Every day I have to warm my coffee up in the microwave. 
 The authors attempted to show how scholarly they are by using very hard to understand language.  I would have appreciated language that was easier to understand to help me deduce their perspectiv 
 Riding the wave of Anti-Afrocentrism, two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr wrote the book The Disuniting of America. An expert on American Presidencies, Schlesinger Jr promotes the idea of America as an integrationist melting-pot rather than a multiculturalist disaster waiting to happen. Because "Canadians have never developed a strong sense of what it means to be a Canadian"  they are not privy to what Americans have enjoyed in e Pluribus Unum. Schlesinger acknowledges that racism is a shameful act and that "white Americans have been racist in [their] laws, in [their] institutions... customs, conditioned reflexes, in [their] souls."  But while these unfair conditions still exist, Schlesinger argues that assimilation and integration are the way forward, citing Ghandi and Martin Luther King, Jr. in an attempt to allow the American sentiment to prevail over all others. Compounding the problems of political correctness, the search for children's self-esteem, individual community development, ethnic separatism and the teaching of history as "filiopietistic commemoration" several internal factors working together in the United States for making this issue a large one are highlighted. The constant ethnocentrism in cultural politics, in Schlesinger's opinion, speaks negatively to educational practises, thereby causing a neo-segregationist cause furthered by Afrocentrism's insistence that there is a specific "Africanity" (to coin Molefi Asante), Afrocentricity and cosmological sensibility that makes blacks fundamentally different from whites. Afrocentrism's insistence that the person of colour is a feeling being whereas the person of non-colour is a reasoning being is, in Schlesinger's opinion, ludicrous. For example, the thespians' world has been dramatically, continuously corrupted by questions of race. Would Shakespeare have wanted Denzel Washington to play his Richard III as he did in New York before he broke into more popular films? Is it more disturbing that Mr. Washington has perfect posture (Richard III was written by Shakespeare to be a deformed-looking creature, a victim of "lookism" if you will) or that Denzel Washington, as he describes himself, is a "bird" (a black person)?  "We have a different way of responding to the world," he said. "We have different ideas about religion, different manners of social intercourse. We have different ideas about style, about language. We have different aesthetics... The job [to be the director of a film about black people] requires someone who shares the specifics of the culture of Black Americans... Let's make a rule. Blacks don't direct Italian films. Italians don't direct Jewish films. Jews don't direct black American films."  This quote by the brilliant black playwright August Wilson, insisting on a black director for the film of his play Fences more specifically troubling to Schlesinger: "By the Wilson rule, only Norweigans would be permitted to direct Ibsen, only Danes to play Hamlet." This is of course simplifying the argument, and attributing something wholly unrelated to Afrocentrism to Afrocentrism. The notion that the skin colour or general appearance or sexual orientation of the actor should be somewhat similar to his character so as to convince, appease and comfort the audience is not a new one created and espoused solely by proponents of Afrocentrism. Placing Afrocentrism more directly in his eye-view than D'Souza, Schlesinger is threatened by anything that attacks traditions of the USA as an integrationist melting-pot, especially where it makes race-relations all the more uncomfortable.  Be that as it may, Schlesinger's readings and analyses are narrow. He trivialises the entire 1996 Oakland, California Ebonics scandal just as D'Souza trivialised the University of Michigan race-relations scandal of 1991: black people were acting up and asked for too much to compensate for their deep-rooted sense of paranoia. He also discusses this paranoia as an overarching "susceptibility". He asks: "Considering what we now know about the plots against black Americans conducted by J. Edgar Hoover and executed by his FBI, who can blame blacks for being forever suspicious of white intentions?"  Still, he trivialises several members of the black community's insistence that the presence and general use of hard drugs in the ghettos of the United States is the doing of the government, describing it as "a more extreme version of the persecution complex... [present in] a society of jostling and competing groups."   The first response to this is an obvious one. A gram of liquid or powdered cocaine, more expensive and more often available in richer, whiter communities can cost a drug dealer two years in jail according to the law, whereas a gram of solid rock-cocaine, the exact same substance in a different form, cheaper more often available in poorer, blacker communities can send a drug dealer to jail for ten years on charges of possession with intent. So for the exact same crime, your average white drug dealer goes to jail for about half a college career whereas your average black drug dealer goes to jail for about an entire secondary school career. The second response to this comment is not as obvious but more rooted in an historical problem. When J. Edgar Hoover as stated before plotted and planned against black groups in the 1960's, and when from 1932 to 1972 the US Public Health Service conducted an experiment on 399 black men in the late stages of syphilis in what is now commonly known as the Tuskegee Experiment, all protocol, both scientific and political, had been thrown out in the name of racism. In 1990, a New York Times-WCBS-TV survey found that 10 percent of African-Americans believed that the U.S. government created AIDS as a plot to exterminate blacks, and another 19 percent could not rule out the possibility that this might be true. As outrageous and unreasonable as this may sound, at one time the Tuskegee experiment must have seemed equally farfetched. Who could imagine the government, all the way up to the Surgeon General of the United States, deliberately allowing a group of its citizens to die from a terrible disease for the sake of an ill-conceived experiment? In light of this and many other shameful episodes in our history, African Americans' widespread mistrust of the government and white society in general should not be a surprise to anyone, nor should it be trivialised by the likes of Schlesinger. As previously stated Schlesinger's readings and analyses are narrow and often unthinking, blaming Afrocentrism for such common things as the phenomenon of black paranoia, which threaten academic values of accuracy and objectivity when played out on paper. 
 I love this band and have all the rest of their cds 
 If you've read Tozer books, this interesting sub categorization approach by subject among books is, a great revisit of Tozer's studied theology. The editing and sequencing is however quite flawed in a divisive way.   Tozer's books systematically reveal his redemption logic for `reasoning, then faith and conversion' vice what he observed as an Evangelical-based logic of  `conversion, then reasoning, then  faith'.  This difference between Tozer and his Evangelical contemporaries seems more a footnote in the higher plane of Tozer books.  In this short highlights text, there is revealed a very aggressive anti-"Evangelical" Tozer not so readily apparent in his books, or adequately defined in this edited text.  Is it a time and place issue so recent that even our puny memories can't recall a seemingly  enormous theological fault line that Tozer battles with Evangelicals?  That the evangelical's of the 40's and 50's that this edited Tozer lambasts in bringing to faith were encouraging conversion first  rather than through Pauline-like reasoning seems mote in relationship to the overall Tozer intellectual  strength. This edited text risks reopening old wounds, or worse,  alienating around the term "Evangelicals". For those interested in reading these reviews, there seems to be too few of us to risk alienating over so narrow a point as amplified in this editing. 
 I read Flags of Our Fathers and enjoyed it more than Flyboys.  Bradley has a writing style that is difficult at times as has personal biases come through very clearly.  As one other reviewer has written, I found it very odd that he often referred to MG Curtis LeMay as "Curtis."  As someone writing about military history, Bradley should have more respect for the uniform and should not call a two star general by his first name like he is talking about one of his golfing buddies.  This was very distracting.  I also found the first couple of chapters of his history lesson very tedious and unfocused - so much so that I nearly quit reading the book.  The latter chapters pick up the pace and are insightful.  Bradley also devotes too much time attempting to demonize the American firebombing tactics.  Thankfully Bradley's bias and negativity toward the Navy and Army is not as pronounced in Flyboys as in FOOF.  This bias is especially odd considering his father was a Navy Corpsman.  
 Misleading title, I was attempting to locate the entire games not just the highlights. 
 I enjoyed Dick's short stories and was expecting the same quality from those in this book, i.e. an engaging plot and interesting characters. Scenes play out tediously with characters and their mind chatter ceaselessly flowing (to a point where it becomes annoying) with bits and pieces of information and occasional dialogue that tries to move whatever plot there is along. There were numerous characters none of which were very interesting or that one could attach affection to. It got to a point three quarters of the way in that I said to myself "Who really cares what happens?" It's really a person's preference whether this type of fiction is page turning or not, as some have said, for me it was not. This was hard labor to get through and it's books like these that make me wonder whether reading a novel is worthwhile, because I for one dislike wasting time with nonsense. Fortunately it's a forgettable piece that I'll probably have no recollection of reading a year from now, thank goodness for that.  From now on I'll be more careful with what I buy that's written by Philip K. Dick. 
 i doubt that i could persuade any die hard grateful dead folks from shying away from this. the grateful dead were fine in their day, but don't tread on deep waters of the NC/TN/KY/VA/WV bluegrass. excellent movement of the fingers on this CD and if yer into fast fingers, well fine. but like fast movement of the fingers does not make the blues; fast movement of the fingers does not make bluegrass.  it comes with the territority. a valiant effort. but stick with the potheads who don't know music from whatever 
 The book is entertaining, however if you wish to read this from a scholarly point of view and you have spent ANY time studying the ancient world to any degree...you will be appauled to find that the author of this book simply added his own interpretations to events, biblical texts, and blatantly stretched (pun so intended) the truth on so much.  I'd had enough from a research point of view when this guy not onlt spelt the names of gods wrong, but hyped only childish popular perspectives that no closer resemble ancient Sumerian belief than does the golden arches as a phallic symbol.  If you take away any claim of being a historical reference, this book is good.  It's a tongue and cheek look on the penis and that is about all it does.  Totally not serious, but a giggle to be had here and there.  Some of which is at the author's expense 
 I did not find this book helpful for someone who has been medically diagnosed as having true thyroid disease. It is old news.  Perhaps can be helpful to someone who suspects they my have a thyroid condition who is just beginning the journey into thyroid disease 
 Wow. I was shocked. Legitimate statements of liberal Christianity include ones like, 'Transubstantiation is mistaken', 'The Vatican does not have a direct pipeline to God', 'Homosexuality is not a sin', 'Condoms and birth control are morally defensible', NOT 'Jesus never performed miracles', 'The trinity does not exist', 'Jesus is not the Son of God.' It is disingenuous for Spong to assert he is a Christian when he disavows ALL the major tenets of the religion - virgin birth, miracles, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension, the trinity, and the deity of Jesus. He believes less in a religion per se and more in a code of ethical conduct like, say, Confucianism, and the "patronizing nonsense" (a la C.S. Lewis) that Jesus was simply a great moral teacher. He even says on page 229, "...a religionless Christianity must be born." Religionless Christianty?! That's a contradiction in terms. Mr. Spong sounds like an ethicist, not a religionist. He also owes Saint Paul an apology for rumor-mongering when the man has long been absent and not around to defend himself.  I do admit though, I liked a lot his discourse on the plight of women and mens' subconscious fear of them. I also liked his observations on homosexuality. What he had to say about Judas was also interesting (but misleading as it is based solely on his own suppositions, not evidence). The section on anti-semitism was informative but that whole subject has always struck me as odd to begin with, i.e., that a Christian could hate or resent a Jew. Very odd.  I'm sure we've all noticed that bible-interpetation discussions are on the same road as capital punishment, birth control, gun control, and abortion: I'm Right and You're Wrong Avenue. Especially with bible interpretation, words and phraseology are open to diverse translations, and theologians themselves disagree.  Oh, and here's my two cents on the Council of Nicea. Of course the Christian theologians had to discuss Christian doctrine and record it for posterity. Of course Christianity had to be, dare I say, 'corporatized' in a way. How can the Word spread without an efficient distribution channel? The remarkable thing is that it did not happen much sooner. You see now, though, how it is very easy for anyone with an advanced intellect (such as Spong) to take the very (true) words I have just said in this paragraph and make it sound convincingly like, "You see!..he admits it..corporatized!..distribution channels!..surely there was wheeling and dealing...these people were not serious...blah blah blah."  I offer one piece of advice. However, I admit I base this advice on my belief that: 1) An all-loving God exists, 2) the gospels are historically accurate, 3) Jesus is the incarnated Son of God and 4) the bible is divinely inspired. Whenever a bible passage irks you, enrages you, or just generally creates any type of irritation in you, remember that YOU are the one thinking about it. And you're not God.    
 I'd never heard of Rebecca Campbell before, but the cover of The Marriage Diaries (as well as the name itself) attracted me to pick it up in the store.  The synopsis on the back cover had me in as well as the first few chapters, I might even go as far to say the first hundred pages. Campbell had me sucked in. I laughed a lot at Sean's wit and related to him more than the very self-centered Celeste. She was very disappointing. Towards the beginning though, I felt for her because Sean seemed disinterested in her, but then suddenly after she surprised the *%#@ out of me, I despised her. I felt like I was betrayed by her. As I read on, Sean confused me to no end. His randomness, his lack of self esteem...I could go on and on. I hated both of these characters way before I reached the end. I don't like reading books where the characters are so shallow and self-absorbed. Sometimes, I wondered if Sean and Celeste were really a married couple.   It's been a long time since I've bought a book that I had to skim through. I hated Sean's metaphors. I mean, one or two metaphors are fine, but three, four...? Boring!!! Overall, I was quickly sucked in and then sucked back out just as quickly. I couldn't wait to be rid of it. 
 I bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching TV...  I wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive.  What it boils down to is that this is a "foot hook" tied to a bar with a nylon strap.  The nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly.  The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down.  I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room.  Negative on both accounts.  You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.    Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down 
 First part of the book, pretty much tell you to skip some material while you are reading, because the fewer words you read, the less time you will spend, the faster you will be. THIS IS TOALLY nonsense. the author even told u to read one line and skip the next, and read the third line. THIS IS ridiculous. Second part told you to use finger, index card, pen....etc to help reading.....that is kinda useless. The third part teachs you how to read magazine, textbook, newspaper...etc. Still the author told you just read the one you are interesting in (even a grade 6 will know that).  SO DON"T BUY IT. I feel so bad wasting my time reading it... 
 Not good for babies...this book has bland colors, boring background and the sarcasm doesn't really fit in a kid's book 
 This was a required text for my accounting class. Let's just say, if you're not familiar with accounting, or not fond of it, this text will make you hate it even more! Be careful because I somehow received the loose leaf edition of it and had to place it in my own binder.. 
 I thought this book was very archaic, the information had no real research to back it up.  It was silly

 I keep thinking I'll like these books and find them useful, and sometimes I do, but this wasn't one of those times.  This will just take up shelf space for a time and then will move on to the library book sale.    So, it you're thinking of buying this book, consider another book and you may not be as disappointed as I was. 
 Basically, anyone who can do a Google search can find the information contained in this book for free.  Most can be found at www.bop.gov and what isn't there can be obtained for free at www.fedcure.org 
 I bought this audio CD set at the Borders store, without the opportunity to preview the narration. Had I been able to do so, I probably never would have purchased it, let alone paid full bookstore price for it. But I needed an audiobook for my long drive the next day, so I relented.   Lesson learned.  The audio quality is very insonsistent, at at times very poor, having been transcribed from the original audiotape recording.   While the author is obviously greatly informed on the historical and geopolitical details of the Middle East, it does read very much like a history text. With the amount of detail presented, and the wide scope of coverage from one end of Europe reaching into the former Soviet states and beyond, one immediately feels the need for visual aids (maps, timelines, etc.) as guidance.   The reader's narration is monotononous, with a very constant cadence which dulls the senses. Each sentence sounds the same as the last. This has the unfortunate effect of rendering each piece of information presented as no more significant than any other, and so all of the events seem to be lost to obscurity. After a while, the narration becomes little more than background noise. No information is retained by the listener 
 My brother bought this cookbook for me 2-3 years ago for Christmas and I have yet to crack it open. You can go online to the foodnetwork website and get all her recipes for free (but why would you???) after seeing some of her more recent episodes, I am ready to toss the book in the trash without even taking a glimpse of the inside. Her recipes scare me and I wouldn't feed half of what she makes to my dog. Don't waste the money. If you think you wanna try her recipes, print them free from the web first before you go investing money in her empire. 
 Incongruos selection of works, grouped between two badly designed covers, with the obvious intention of just selling it to people with no other interest in architecture than to have a book to place in their living  rooms.  Zellner's writing is of poor style and denotes lack of knowledge  and research 
 I wanted the home antenna system so I could bring my SkyFi2 receiver out of my vehicle and listen to it in the house too. I set up the antenna in a south facing window as per the instructions but soon discovered that this was unnecessary as the high gain antenna picked up the signal right through the roof with no visible or audible degradation of the signal.  Now it sits unobtrusively on top of my stereo cabinet obviating the need to route the lead wire through the house to the window. Great!  Good-bye commercial radio with all your annoying commercials and mindless, yapping, moronic DJs 
 All of the writing & criticism of Martin Amis has as much credibility as his screenplay for the film  Saturn 3 with Farrah Fawcett, Kirk Douglas and Harvey Keitel. If you really must know what the moments gossip is in  Manhattan restaurants, skip Amis's laborious attempts at writing and skim  through the tabloid Talk to which he contributes. Though personally I think  the glossy photos of Gwinneth Paltrow are better. Amis adds to the humidity  in the title of his own book 
 I bought this book before a trip to Costa Rica, based on the "Lonely Planet" name alone.  Lonely Planet usually publishes the best travel books, but not in this case.  We found that the directions to many of the establishments were incorrect, as were the descriptions.  Some of the locals even pointed out parts of the book that were blatantly incorrect, such as certain restaurants or bars that were in a different part of town than stated in the book. This particular book could have used a better fact-checker.  I will not be taking it with me on my next trip to Costa Rica 
 I read the back cover of this book and immediately knew most of what would happen.  As soon as I met the character who would turn out to be the driver, I knew the rest of the story.  It was extremely easy to figure out and quite disappointing.  The story's decent.  The text flows nicely, and the suspension of disbelief is strong, but where did Nick's originality go?  Where's the sweet and innocent charm of The Notebook, A Walk to Remember, and Nights in Rodanthe?  It seems like he's run out of steam, or didn't care too much about this one.  A decent book to read, but don't expect anything spectacular as you would with his earlier work 
 I like to use the Amazon reviews when purchasing books, especially alert for dissenting perceptions about higly rated items, which usually disuades me from a selection.  So I offer this review that seriously questions the popularity of this work - I found it smug, self-serving and self-indulgent, written by a person with little or no empathy, especially for the people he castigates. For example, his portrayal of the family therapist seems implausible and reaches for effect and panders to the  "shrink" bashers of the world. This "play for effect" tone throughout the book was very distasteful to me 
 I think Afghan Whigs is the worst band of all times after Cheap Trick.Someone said to me that this album was the best by them,did he drink some bottles of tequila before 
 The South is where it is at right now, whether you like it or not.  Despite the ongoing East Coast and West Coast domination of the 80s and 90s, 2000 and beyond was all about the hip-hop scene below the Mason-Dixon line.  Sure there were a lot of rap artists making noise before 2000 like Outkast, Goodie Mob, Geto Boys, UGK, and the No Limit and Cash Money camps.  But the new millenium has seen the explosion of the Dirty South, leaving everybody else scratching their heads.  There have even been comparisons of the South's evolution with the rise of the West Coast in the early 90s.  And even though a lot of artists have quality material coming from the South (Paul Wall, Bun B, David Banner, Outkast, Trick Daddy, Slim Thug), there are still a number of acts that simply don't make the grade.  Dem Franchize Boyz are a perfect example of this with their album On Top Of Our Game.  Sure, it helps to have an utter genius like Jermaine Dupri to put your album out during the best possible opportunity in rap history.  Nevertheless, it all comes down to the quality of work and the marketing of that product.  They even had a hit song like "I Think They Like Me (remix)" featuring JD, Da Brat, and Bow Wow debuted months ago (which by the way sounds much like their previous hit "In My White Tee.")  But that's the problem right there....it was months before their album was even released.   Oh, and the song appearing on Young Fly and Flashy months prior didn't help either. The new single "Lean Wit It, Rock Wit It" does very little, but unfortunately it's one of the better songs on the album!  There are a few decent cuts like "My Music" featuring Bun B and maybe "Stop Callin' Me."  But besides those cuts and the hidden remix of  "In My White Tee", there isn't much else that you can even deem listenable!  "Ridin' Rims" will only appeal to those who have a fascination with spinners and the pimped-out rides.   Three Six Mafia fans will enjoy the group's vocals on "Don't Play With Me," but again you already have to be a fan of their music to appreciate that song.  "Bricks 4 The High" featuring Jim Jones, "You Know What It Is," "Give Props" and "Stop Callin' Me" all just sound uninteresting. "Freaky As She Wanna Be" is purely a stripper slow jam.  "Suckas Come And Try Me" uses the exact same melody from 'White Tee' yet again!  The last track "They Don't Like That" pretty much foreshadows the feelings most will have about this album.  Listening to On Top Of Our Game by Dem Franchize Boyz is bad enough.  Purchasing this 'franchise' for yourself is simply a bad investment 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 THE FOUNTAINHEAD has been described by one of its many followers - yes, followers, not readers, for the book is essentially unreadable -- as a "passionate defense of individualism [that] presents an exalted view of man's creative potential."   This is a fair description, although it points unintentionally to the book's main flaw:  it is not a novel, but a tract posing as a novel.      Traditional progressive novels tend to be suspicious of the exalted, especially of those who occupy exalted positions based on birth or social class. In the case of Ms. Rand, the exalted are those rare individuals who, like herself, must be allowed to work their will upon the world because they believe themselves exalted.  A circular argument at best, a bad faith argument in truth, this tacit nod to the slow ascent of the common man and woman since the Enlightenment spares Ms. Rand from plumping for monarchy which, even by today's repellent neo-conservatives standards, is universally seen to be repellent.  Because her main character, Howard Roark, architect extraordinaire, is an argument and not recognizably a person, he not surprisingly suffers from a lack of inner-animation.  Sensitive readers will chafe against the underlying and predictable framework that ultimately treats characters as props for Ms. Rand's objectivist philosophy, an anti-progressive stew of prejudices posing as a critique of the welfare state and its "leveling effects."    Here's the problem with her "philosophy:"  for every Howard Roark it raises up as Hero, it writes off millions of people as unworthy of our interest, our sympathy and our compassion. Unkindness is not a philosophy most find acceptable.  With THE FOUNTAINHEAD, Rand attempted to make it so and has managed to fool many.  Because she has, she is therefore lauded by her conservative followers because her apologia absolves them of any responsibility for the fate of their fellow men and women.     Regrettably, this book and her other tendentious work, ATLAS SHRUGGED, have found their way into the backpacks of idealistic college students.  One suspects that many, because their relative youth causes them to see themselves as unique individuals, are seduced by the notion that they, too, are slated for Heroic status.  I have nothing against people having heroes; young people especially should have them.  But Howard Roark is no hero.  He's a stick figure that represents a hero.  I suspect too, that because of their general unreadability, students think the books are "deep."   In retrospect, it seems true that those people whom I knew in college who didn't finish this tract-posing-as-a-novel were people who tended to be relatively reasonable in their social and political views.  Those who did finish it, on the other hand, tended to be immoderate and dogmatic.   Judging by some of the reviews posted here,  this probably remains true today. 
  Mr. Cahills book offers an interesting and controversial take on history. He is an excellent and compelling writer, but his differentiation between pre and post diaspora Israelites when discussing the Celts in several of his books is not always clear.   It was only the post-Babylonian diaspora Southern Kingdom Israelites who came to be known as Jews, around 500 BC.   It was the post-Assyrian diaspora (721 BC) of the larger ten-tribed Northern Kingdom Israelites who became what we today call the Celts. It is they who are both the Island Celts who populated Ireland, Scotland, Wales, etc., and their cousins, the Continental Celts who sacked the Roman Empire under many Celtic tribal names and who make up most of northwest Europe today.    The author could perhaps clarify this part of his presentations on European history by reviewing losttribes.net or any other modern Celtic site based on contemporary archeology.  
 I'm taking a college course and this book really bites. Reading it just leaves me in a daze. He goes on and on about how this method won't work and that method won't work which completely covers up what we need to learn. I'm getting 98.18% in the class on term 8 of 10, but it's not due to this book. Unfortuneatley I'm stuck with the book because it's what the school uses. Find another one 
 I should have listened to Yael's review... dead on.  Nothing special about this book.  I'll be donating it to the library 
 Professor Ellis is a very intelligent man, but he plays fast and loose with the facts, and sometimes he uses his gift for writing prose in ways that mislead the reader especially in, American Sphinx.  Ellis has obviously covered all of the ground with regard to what is known about Jefferson--but he doesn't objectively present all of the factual scholarship existing about our 3rd President.   If you want to know more of the detail of what was all involved with Sally Hemings, you MUST read Douglass Adair's essay "The Jefferson Scandals."  This essay is found in the book: Fame of the Founding Fathers: Essays by Douglass Adair.  Published by W.W. Norton.  Sally Hemings was the daughter of Jefferson's father-in-law; and Sally's lover was not T.J. but T.J.'s nephew (his sister's son).  That's why Jefferson never talked about the "scandal" because his close family relatives were involved; however, not the way Prof. Ellis says.  The unfortunate fact is that Prof. Ellis mentions Douglass Adair in American Sphinx, but he never mentions Adair's research (which Ellis cannot reasonably be ignorant of) on the alleged Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson liason.  It's obvious from American Sphinx that Ellis has read Adair's essays.  Prof. Ellis must know that the best evidence exonerates Thomas Jefferson, but he never tells us about that. The well publicized DNA test does NOT prove TJ was the father of any of Hemings' children.  TJ never fathered any children with Hemings and Ellis knows it. Prof. Ellis is intellectually dishonest on this point, and on many other points of Jefferson's life.  Too bad because he would otherwise have written a tour-de-force.  Instead it's a tour-de-FRAUD 
 Sorry Ms. Cornwell but this is not one of your better efforts. In fact, it reads like a first novel - too much insipid dialogue. Little more to say. I give it 2 because I finished it - barely 
 What i mean by the title of my review is yes this movie is going to be funny its Monty Python! but there is also some parts where it just really gets out of hand in my mind. If you are new to Monty Python I would get the quest for the holy grail before this one. Also the Monty Python's Flying Circus is great too. It comes in a 16 DVD set so it will give you a lot of their old stuff. I really did not enjoy certain parts. But there is a few good moments.  
 I mean seriously guys, is it really worth forking over to those greedy peeps at Sony over 40 dollars just for a silly memory card. There is an easier way to do it ya know. For your psp, if the game is really important to you and you can't save it. Just press up on the power switch real quick the screen will go off..it will go on hold and next time you wanna play it again.. just push it back up..and hopefully if you did it right you'll have the game right back in the place you left it..hey it saved me 50 dollars..and it can do the same thing for yo 
 I like John Grisham, but I think his more recent novels have been lacking in the storyline department.  THE LAST JUROR is a typical example.    This book is a fairly decent coming-of-age novel about a young journalist growing up in a deep southern town in Mississippi.  Unfortunately, there is not much of a plot that holds the events of THE LAST JUROR together.  Instead, we get a rather rambling, slow-moving narrative that takes place over a ten-year period, with a generous dollop of Grisham's political views on Vietnam, Wal-Mart, religion, and a couple of other hot-button issues.  THE LAST JUROR is not a suspense novel or a thriller (despite being marketed as one).  The plot described on the dust jacket of this novel doesn't really get started until maybe the last 80 pages or so.  The whole revenge plot feels tacked on and phony.  The ending is anti-climactic, to say the least.  I think Grisham is an entertaining writer, and his description of life in a small Southern town in the 1970s is actually very interesting in spots.  There are some scenes in this novel that are quite charming and enjoyable.  But, in the end, it doesn't add up to a good suspense novel, and that's what I thought I paid money for.  If you're looking for a good thiller, my advice is to try Grisham's earlier work, or the books of Greg Isles instead 
 I couldn't get past the first 150 pages of it.  I just found myself lossing to much interest in the story to the point where I didn't care what happened to the characters or Krynn.  You could skip this trilogy and completely understand what's going on on Krynn during the War of Souls.  Rabes style of writing just isnt for me I guess.  The first book of the series was good, but not really this one in my opinion.  If you have nothing better to read, then pick this up, other than that I dont think it's worth it 
 If you're looking for writing that is as clever or as witty as Dean Koontz's, take one pace back away from this book. If you're expecting storyytelling on par with John Grisham, take another step back. If you're hoping for a story loaded with interesting tidbits and facts on par with Dan Brown, take another step back.   This book was unoriginal, boring, predictable, and very cliche. Don't waste your time or your money like I did. 
 Apparently when this film was released at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival it incited a riot and while making his escape Jodorowsky's limousine was pelted by rocks. When the film was released in Mexico City it incited a riot there as well and almost led to Jodorowsky's deportation. I strongly agree that they should have deported him because I believe that this is possibly the worst film that I have ever seen. I mean it definitely ranks up there with such sludge as Valerie Breiman's Going Overboard and Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic. However while these two films are nothing more than a low budget comedy and a cheesy science fiction film, Fando y Lis is full of enough art house pretensions that it could choke a horse. Now, please do not get me wrong, I mainly watch foreign films and prefer well done American independent films more than the flashy, vacuous films released by Hollywood, but, in my humble opinion, Fando y Lis has nothing to offer a film audience.  Taking place in a post-apocalyptic land, the lovers Fando and his semi-paraplegic lover Lis, she can stand but she cannot walk, are on a quest to find the city of Tar, the only city that has not fallen. During their travels they come across quite a number of oddballs, including a group dressed out in tuxedos and evening dresses enjoying a jazz trio amongst the burnt out husks of ancient cars, three old women playing cards with peaches used for money and to the winner the amours of a chunky fellow sitting in his tighty whities, amongst others. As Fando makes his way through the devastated landscape his affection for Lis changes dramatically from syrupy sweet to almost sadistic and he abandons her quite a few times throughout the film. This pretty much sums up the "plot" of this film. While David Lynch's Eraserhead and Tsukamoto Shinya's Tetsuo the Ironman also lacked a cohesive plot overall themes could be read into them. This film on the other hand is an utter disaster.  Maybe I am being unfair and maybe I should give this film another chance before I rank it with the two bombs listed above, but there are so many good films available and I do not want to lose a hour and a half of my life watching this film that is at the bottom of filmic value, but at the height of pretentiousness.  
 I was really excited about this book before I opened it.  I was very disappointed to see that it really only covers larger houses which already have space available.  All the pictures show rooms with high to very high ceilings, entrance ways, and alot of open space.  Unfortunately, I think, that the average house is much smaller, with less room to work with & lower ceilings, not every place has utility rooms, verandas or entrance ways to utilize.  Even the bathrooms were larger than most I've seen.  Also, many houses do not even have very much extra wall space due to small room dimensions, windows, doorways & possibly a fireplace.  Try to work around that - that's what I was expecting to see, I guess, more variety in the types of homes.  If you do get this book, be prepared to renovate 
 Anachronistic fruiting structures and their traditional, but unfortunately extinct, dispersers makes for a fascinating scientific/natural history topic. Unfortunately, it was Ms. Barlow who tackled this one and in the first 13 pages has made more references to 'ghosts' and 'haunted groves' than my scientific stomach can retain. To be fair, the first chapter is entitled 'Ghost Stories' - what should I have expected?! If I'd read the Table of Contents and skimmed its content, I probably would have recognized the work for what it seems to be - a knock-off parasite of the scholarly paper-back book genre. Who the hell are the Perseus Book Group anyway -- certainly not Harvard Press! 
 First of all, I have to say Alice Adams is (was, alas) one of my favorite writers. Of short stories. Not novels. I was thrilled to have won a short story competition to be in one of her workshops. To me, almost all of her stories are perfect. I can read them over and over. Her novels, however, are a different story. Rich Rewards has its rewards and there is something intriguing about Second Chances. But all the others left me disappointed.  A disaster.  Which is how I saw "After the War" from page one. Ridiculous characters. A mess. I would rather that my memories of Alice Adams did not include this awful work 
 I picked up this book because I was interested in future life progressions.  As one fairly conversant with the doctrines of reincarnation and recognizing this book was written over 20 years ago, my concerns are as fresh as they would have been when the book was first available:  (1) a total lack of objectivity. Dr. Goldberg has his own spiritual beliefs about reincarnation and things surrounding reincarnation, and he teaches and preaches from that viewpoint. Unfortunately, he fails to make it clear that he is teaching his personal dogma. (2)He is quick to condemn.  I was particularly struck by his blanket condemnation of all witchcraft, all covens, and by extension, all magical practices.  This bespeaks ignorance of the subject and comes from a fairly narrow view, much as if I were to give a blanket condemnation of Christianity.  Personally, I believe Christianity to be far more dangerous, but I recognize that this is opinion, and don't preach it as fact.  (3) Overall, I found his research and techniques very disorganized.  To me, this is rather sad for an accomplished hypnotist, because it diminishes his effectiveness.  Both in his writing and reporting, and in his interviews, I felt he  could greatly improve both interview and writing style by having a better idea of where he is going and the cues given by subjects.      Personally, Dr. Goldberg is not a practitioner I would select to help me with regression or progression, based on my experience with this book. There are other authors dealing with the subject.  I would direct the interested reader to a more solid author, such as Brian Weiss. 
 This is a little far fetched but bare with, a London born Actress transplants herself to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap...and then writes about a London born Actress being transplanted  to Los Angeles, after landing on a Soap. Got it? Personally this psuedo semiautobiographical novel about Hughes life (or lack there of) is testament that some actors should remain just that! The cynical nature in which her character sees Los Angles and the people surrounding her is way too close to accurate for this to be classified as true "fiction" and the parallels between her main "villain" Meredith Contini and a certain fabulous legendary New York Based All My Children icon is so blatant it borders on insulting. Her work on General Hospital was good, Her work on All My Children was tolerable, at best, but her work as a writer makes me ashamed to admit Finola Hughes is a fellow Brit. 
 When I read Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World, I was so dazzled by his prose that I found myself stopping again and again to reread and admire his sentences. In The Hours, he combined the same stylistic virtuosity (paragraph after paragraph imitating Virginia Woolf's style, for example) with a novelistic structure that took three separate narratives set in different times and slowly wound them together to devastating effect. Specimen Days also presents three linked narratives, but everything that we admired about Cunningham's earlier books is missing here. The prose is utterly pedestrian, the plotting ranges from the unlikely to the preposterous, and the links between the three narratives are disappointingly mechanical and superficial.  The three narratives of Specimen Days are set in New York in different eras--the late nineteenth century, the present, and some time a century or so from now. To be fair, there's a thematic connection between them: in each case, one character sacrifices everything for the good of another character whom he or she knows only superficially. But the sad difference between Specimen Days and The Hours is this: in The Hours the three narratives merge to create something larger than each one is by itself, but in Specimen Days the three stories, presented sequentially, fail to illuminate--or even to relate to--one another. Instead, they're connected merely by a quirk (in each, there's a character who recites lines from Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass), a prop (a white porcelain bowl), and the characters' similar names. One thinks longingly of the subtly with which Cunningham evolved the stories in The Hours and wonders what went wrong here.  Each of the stories in Specimen Days is more improbable than the last. The most successful is the first, about a boy who gives up everything to save another character from a disaster he only imagines and ends up saving her from an actual unimagined real disaster. (Since this story is the one most worth reading, I won't give away more of the plot.)  In the second story, a police hotline operator/psychologist unaccountably walks away from her career and her boyfriend to go on the lam with a child bomber whom the police are seeking and who, she thinks, will eventually kill her anyway. Sure. The third story is set in a United States that has been visited by a new species (think large versions of the Geico gecko, but without the engaging British accent) and that has been largely laid waste by some kind of unspecified nuclear or ecological disaster. The story has to do with a lizard character who helps a near-human android get from New York to Denver so that the android can contact his creator. The android suffers from an inability to experience human emotions, but through a turn of events when they reach Denver, he discovers that he can experience beauty and compassion like a full human being after all. "It seems I did a better job with you than I'd realized," says the android maker approvingly. That's right: think Star Trek's Mr. Data meets the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz. How amazing, how disappointing, that such derivative dreck is coming from the pen of Michael Cunningham.   
 Not a single practical suggestion. Nothing but hippie platitudes advocating eco-socialism. A retread pseudophilosophy makes it even more boring. A complete waste of time 
 but a polemic. my apologies for abusing the democratic voting/reviewing process. my lame excuse it that down below mitchell's own editor gives this book 5 stars, and somebody had to counterbalance that. mitchell hasn't just translated/written on the gita, but the german poet rilke, the gospel according to jesus, and the tao te ching (his one book i read, and disliked) etc. reading the reviews of his books you'll see that accessibility it touted by numerous people, but many (seemingly serious and well read) others claim that his loose interpretations miss the mark. you decide for yourself, but as for me, i'm looking forward to his coming releases "dabbling in the qu'ran", "sticking my toe in the Holy See", and the grand finale "Unencumbered by Humility - The Religion of Mitchell: How you too can be smarter than everybody else", available at the great introductory price of just $498. Enjoy 
 NOT A SOILD EP AT ALL. I REMBER WHEN IT HIT I WONDERED WHAT HAPPENED.  BUT WHEN "BLACK MAFFIA" LIFE HIT I KNEW ATL WAS ALIVE AND WELL.  IF YOU ARE A TRUE ATL FAN PURCHASE THIS CD " FOR THE FUNK OF IT.&quot 
 This book is downright hilarious.  Santorum is so ignorant, it's outrageous.  If you want a good laugh, borrow it, don't buy it.  Rick's stupidity has finally done him in though.  Say goodbye Ricky 
 If you read anything substantial with regard to John Lennon. You realize he didnt care particularly for intellectuals that had the need to impress people by attempting to show everyone how intelligent they are. Unfortunately that seems to be the case with the Mr. Tim Riley, the author of this Book. I too am a huge fan of the Beatles and  know every song they ever wrote. I have listened  intently to all the songs that John and Paul  wrote as Beatles. Not only for the purpose of analyseing there style which I truly loved, but more for the pure musical enjoyment and the happines that they brought to me and the rest of the world at such a special time in History. I am also a musician for over 40 years....... But the pontification of Mr. Riley, to speak with such subjective and self proclaimed knowledge of the thoughts of each of the boys from Liverpool, as though he knew exactly what was going through each of their respective minds with every note they played and every drum beat that came from Ringo's Ludwigs and his use of adjectives describeing John's Pain in particular phrases of individual songs on certain recordings was beyond preposterous. He made Howard Cosewll sound like a Humble Pubescent. Notwithstanding this dramatic turn off style of writing, there is no doubt that he has considerable knowledge of music in a technical sence and  the book is informative with regard to dates and times songs were written and recorded. But there are so many more objective  books with that information and that dont require you to suffer the self inflated pomposity of such a musical intellectual.  Try  The Beatles  Day by Day (etc:)by Craig Cross or even Beatlesongs by William Dowlding...  
 Unfortunatley, Ms. Ornstein's book is not based on actual research, but rather on pre-established suppositions. The gender climate of a school is best evaluated by looking at two factors - student grades and disciplinary actions.  If male students have lower grades than female students, and/or if more male students are disciplined than female students, then it is clear that the school is anti-boy and is simply not trying to teach male students.  Fortunatley, parents are waking up to this fact, and there have been several lawsuits (most notably in Wisconsin) challenging public schools gender bias against male students.  The so called "gender-fair" class menitoned in this book wasn't - since not as many male as female students received "A's".    This book also does not evaluate issues outside of school.  For example, the best measure of the status of a demographic group is to look at mortality rate.  The fact that male students in all demographic groups have a higher mortality rate than female students is not discussed.  This is particularly important since a major contributing factor to this trend is the fact that adolescent males have a higher suicide rate than adolescent females.  Orenstein also does not discuss this gender gap in arrest rate.  Again, the "health" of a demographic group in school is easy to evaluate - simply look at grades and discipline.  
 Good treatice on stating the obvious but light on meaningful detail and depth into particulars 
 Yes, the plot is interesting.  Yes, the characters are (somewhat) believable.  But it is very apparent that Mr. Weber has a bonus clause on his contract for the number of adverbs he can use.  How many different ways can you depict mannerisms and emotions while speaking?  Just ask Mr. Weber.  I tried (in vain) to find a portion of dialogue that did not have the characters words embellished with so many trite expressions to the point of total distraction from the storyline.  Too bad, it could have been a great book. Also, what's with the ending?  Did he come to a point where he had a limit on his page count and had to condense 10 chapters of conclusion into one Epilogue 
 "As an African American gay man, Gomes is interested in re-viewing the biblical passages on sexuality and race" Without even picking up this book, you can see where it is going. The Bible clearly speaks out against the homosexual lifestyle? Strike those passages. The Bible is God's word and ought to read as such, not reinterpreted to make us feel better about our sin. By the way, being named one of the best seven preachers by TIME magazine is like being named one of the best seven Republicans by MoveOn.org, it doesn't hold much authority. Read a decent translation of the Bible for yourself and see what God has to say to you 
 This was bad enough for me to write my first review on Amazon. Quite simply, I ran out of digits to count economic fallacies. The author clearly was scavenging for data to prove his point. 
 Although I enjoyed that the book seemed genuinely honest, it didn't mask the fact that the author was an arrogant and ultimately unsuitable wanna-be spy. Her prose was riddled with fake self-deprecation that was meant to cover up a smug attitude. It was no wonder she didn't get very far in her clandestine career. In fact, she exposes the agency's transgressions more by way of her own mistakes -- one wonders whether her supervisors would advise taking a friend along for a meeting with an agent, which the author does at one point in the book. It's also seemed pretty silly that she couldn't come up with better cover for herself that wouldn't leave random people at a party wondering about her "spooky-sounding government job." Since Moran seems to be relatively intelligent, one can only assume that she WANTED people to suspect her of being a spy, just to feel cool. Would you want someone like that actually being in the business of protecting this country? It's hard to believe that any of her friends/family were too terribly surprised when she finally DID "blow her cover."  Read the book for an insider's view, but don't be fooled into thinking it was too bad this author left her CIA career. 
    I found the first 50 pages or so to be intriguing, after that it became a grind to endure. Mr. Gardner makes very indirect references to the impact of the media on the vignettes that he recounts, yet seemingly asserts that the individuals involved acted in a vacuum.    The author credits Bill Clinton with single handedly coming up with "mend it, don't end it" for welfare, yet does not explain how the Republican congress of 94 had any part in this course of action.      Darwin is treated as an infallible truth, yet Mr. Gardner does not address the lack of transitional forms, the various "truths" that are allowed to exist, like the stages of the human embryo [fish, primate with tail] and the lack of any new species.     The author does have some interesting ideas, yet the simplistic characterization of the people or ideas that he analyzes [see the part on George Bush] fails to allow us, the readers, to form a realistic idea of the forces acting on them.     So how do I change minds 
 Frankly, I was extremely disappointed with this book.  I originally bought it for a Data Structures class and soon found that it was never of any use.  The book is extremely hard to follow and, at times, fails to include enough information.  Such as Big-O notation.  I count a total of 5 pages that show no useful examples but constantly talk about Big-Oh (notice the "h") while providing no solutions to finding the bounds 
 My initital impressions of 'American Gods' were nearly uniformly positive.  Although I had not read any reviews previous, I was aware of the level of hype and praise for this novel.  But like a doomed traveler in Fred Pohl's 'Gateway', the book never achieved "turn-a-round".  The central storyline is further and further pushed off, and often seems to occur on the sidelines.  Gaiman's prose is engaging and easy to slip into, but I felt empty in the end, without significant payoff or a true sense of journey.  Those wishing to delve into urban fantasy may be better served by Tim Powers.  "Last Call" in particular serves as an excellent counterpoint to "Gods 
 Gosh, maybe I shouldn't review this book, but then - any book that I bring home that is so difficult to follow that I just couldn't finish it probably deserves one star. While the subject matter was of great interest to me, the writing style was not a comfortable read. I was constantly trying to remember who was who, what time period it had just jumped to and then jumped to again and, worst of all, the flow of the words was simply missing. Hard to pinpoint the problem, but by Page 42 I was so confused and frustrated, not entertained, and wondering why I was working so hard to read it when I had a stack of other promising new works waiting. (Now I'm readin 'A Long Way Down' by Nick Hornby and was mesmerized from the first page. A perfect example of a well-structured story that just glides from page to thought-provoking page. My full review to be posted shortly. 
 I like Susana Palazuelos, I enjoyed her meal at Izote in Mexico City...and have used her recipes, but I have no idea what she was doing for this book.  In my opinion, this was done when her vision was still quite immature.  My main complaint about her recipes is that they are completely Creole Revisionist... in other words they are done from a very Spanish / Euro perspective... the Herb, Chile & Spice combinations have been extremely simplified & you really do not get to understand & appreciate the true genius of Mexican Cuisine.  Its like a Spaniard revised all the recipes.  Truly dissappointing.... it should be embarrassing to here that Rick Bayless's books are a bit closer than this one 
 What can I say about Eva Peron that hasn't already been said? Her unparalleled power & beauty have become legendary and so has her bad reputation. Was she really as ruthless as her notoriety leads us to believe? It depends on who you ask and what you read.   John Barnes biography has been translated to several languages and it has been re-issued several times but this is not an accurate biography of the enigmatic and now mythic Eva Peron. There are too many inaccuracies that just fuel the myths and Barnes' account reads more like a tabloid. It's a watered-down, less hateful version of Mary Main's "The Woman with the Whip". Both biographies are very similar in tone. The main difference between the two is that John Barnes does give Eva Peron credit for some of her accomplishments especially with her foundation. Main, on the other hand does not and she cites greed, hatred and megalomania as the reasons behind all of Eva's achievements. Main also accuses Evita of being personally responsible for the atrocities committed by the state police during the first Peronist period knowing full well that there isn't the slightest shred of evidence. She even states so in her book ("There is no proof"). John Barnes doesn't and for this I give him credit.  One of my complaints with the newer versions of John Barnes' biography is that the epilogue is omitted. Those who are interested in purchasing this book are better off getting their hands on a good used copy of the original instead. The epilogue is interesting because despite the author's negative portrayal of Eva Peron, it clearly demonstrates that when all is said and done, the administrations that followed Peron and Evita were far worse. Even by the opposition's point of view. Barnes does a side by side comparison between Videla's chaotic Argentina of the 70's to Peron's less destructive and more popular form of government. He states that Peron may have had some of his enemies imprisoned but "they all came out alive". That is not the case with later Argentine administrations where thousands were systematically locked up, tortured and killed. Even children and the elderly were not safe.  Having read countless biographies of Eva Peron in both Spanish and English, both pro and anti-Peronist, I can frankly state I know alot about Eva Peron including all of the myths surrounding her persona. In my opinion, the best biography of Eva Peron in the English language is Nicholas Fraser & Maryssa Navarro's informative and well researched book. Like Barnes book, it has been re-issued several times under several titles, the most current being "Evita: The Real Life of Eva Peron". JM Taylor's "Eva Peron: The Myths of a Woman" is also helpful and well documented and Robert Crassweller's "Peron and the Enigmas of Argentina" is well researched, well-written and is one of the best Peron biographies available anywhere. There is a huge difference between the woman portrayed in the books I mentioned above and the heinous character depicted here. The Eva Peron that John Barnes presents to us was an extraordinary woman but incredibly ruthless, vain and unpleasant. It's the exact same Eva Peron portrayed in the erroneous musical that bears her name. Like many other anti-Evita biographers before and after, Barnes is clearly fascinated by Eva Duarte despite the harsh character flaws he sees in her. Mary Main, Tim Rice, George Bruce, WA Harbinson, all have written scandalous and in some instances down-right malicious books about the woman and display her as an ambitious monster who squashed anyone that got in her way but for some reason, they did not hate her, at least not to the extent you'd expect. Why is that? Was it because she was a woman? Was it because she was so young and beautiful? The director of the stage play, Harold Prince stated that in his opinion Eva Peron was a "villian" corrupted by power but something about her drew him to her and he cited her gender as one of the reasons. Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber stated that Evita was "extremely attractive" and possessed qualities that were admirable despite being the most "unsympathetic" character he has ever written music for. For those like Prince and Webber, who consider Eva to be an amoral, murderous dictator it's hard to believe that they would feel any kind of sympathy towards her but like Barnes, they do. Eva's youth, gender, glamour and charisma have a lot to do with it but in Eva Peron's case it's something more. There is something about her that intrigues even those who despise her and that is rare. One should also keep in mind that if Evita has become "immortal", her detractors are as much to blame for this as her admirer's. John Barnes' book tries hard to condemn her but in the end, it loves her to pieces.  "Evita First Lady: A Biography of Eva Peron" is an entertaining read but it's too flawed, too historically inaccurate to be considered a good biography. Maryssa Navarro, Nicholas Fraser, JM Taylor, A Dujovne Ortiz, Robert Crassweller and a countless others have done better. Give their books a try before committing your time to this unless you are more interested in reading a more sensationalized and imprecise narrative of Eva Duarte de Peron's life story 
 While offering useful guides and interventions for assisting Indigenous communities to comprehend and disrupt the distructive systems of colonization, and the importance of understanding, in general terms, the impacts of colonization on our daily lived lives and social interactions among one another--Indigenous to Indigenous-- this text, although stating it covers "North America," conspicuously makes invisible, and completely erases Mexico, as well a significant portion of the Southwest and the South.  There existed and exist to this day dramatically different U.S. policies towards Indigenous peoples in non-reservation spaces, and these Indigenous North Americans are off the radar screen of these authors.  It is understandable that reservation and reserve-based Indigenes, whose official Federal identities were established through relocations, displacements, sexualized violence and genocidal policies of mass destruction from the 18th through the 19th century, are urgently concerned about de-tribalization, dispossession, de-enrollment, and false representation in enrollments.  These are important concerns for the sustainability of all of our Indigenous traditions, languages, religions, natural resources, health, education, social equity, and political autonomy in the face of increasing threats against Indigenous sovereignty and lifeways, hemispherically, through the strengthening of globalization, NAFTA, and militarization. At a time when questions of solidarity among ALL North American Indigenous peoples is seriously at risk and in question, this particular form of intervention falls short.  This text is problematic on numerous levels.  First, it limits the definition of 'Indigenous' in 'North America' to Canada and the U.S.  This approach is hegemonic due to the privileging of the Indigenes primarily colonized by either Anglo-Saxon and/or French colonizers and militarisms, and limits the range of Indigeneity to those who are now enrolled and/or reservation-based, thus misleading readers that Indigeneity begins and ends at the borders of interned spaces of the Anglo settlement socieity. For reasons not explained, nor regarded by the authors as relevant, or necessary to their analysis of colonization and decolonization in 'North America'(note: the Index does not even provide a reference to Mexico, nor the Spanish colonization in North America)the authors disregard the much longer experiences of colonization by the Indigenes of the areas of the U.S. below the 34th parallel, who dominantly experienced a FIRST wave of Spanish colonization, and a SECOND wave of Anglo settler society colonization, and who were 'de-tribalized' and dispossessed, indentured, and racialized during the violent purges of both the Spanish project, as well as the Confederate States of America (CSA) invasion.  Please remember that in and just after 1861, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona seceded with the CSA at the 34th parallel, officially.  Also recall, that the slave-holding five 'civilized tribes' of "Indian Territory," in Oklahoma, also seceded with the CSA in 1861, and thereby sanctioned the dispossesion and de-tribalization of MIGRATORY and horse-culture Indigenous full-blood and mixed blood (mestizo/metis) peoples in the 'Southwest'-borderlands in order to make expansion of slavery policies and lifestyles into areas of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona. All along the Mexico-U.S. border, today, therefore, are millions of dispossed Indigenous people, who have strong religious, language, medicine, ancestral, matrilineal, political ties to the land--on the Mexico AND the U.S. side.  Recall, the U.S. invasion and theft of what is now problematically termed the 'Southwest', sliced a contestable militarized wall through tribal communities from Brownsville to San Diego.  These are what we may term 'transnational' and 'diasporic' Indigenous communities, who by the violent social, political and economic policies of genocide practiced by not only in the configurations of the Spanish, and Anglo colonization projects, but also practiced by Indigenous peoples of North America in "Indian Territory," have had their 'official' identities robbed from them.  Yet, their identities and their Indigenous ways of life endure today.   Today, it is vitally important for scholars--both Indigenous (from North America, Central America, South America, Pacific Islander, and from all the continents of Earth) and non-Indigenous doing anti-globlazation and anti-capitalism research and community-based education to challenge and refuse this particular approach to 'Indigenous' studies in the transnational field, especially those who are wanting to understand and to theorize the complex processes of Indigeneity, beyond borders, beyond nationalisms, beyond hegemonic and Anglo-colonized/dominated privileged spaces in the Global North which tend to (perhaps without conscious intention, yet show a considerable lack of critical inclination) replicate and perpetuate colonizer ideologies of racism, sexism, classism, racialization, stereotyping, division, hierarchy and patriarchy.  Interventions?  The visual on this cover is incredibly problematic.  From the get-go this symbology, this sign and what it signifies is exclusion and separatism.  With the term "Indigenous" merged with it (which traditionally goes against many Indigenous cultures ways of approaching problems and solution-making)the viewer can be confused about meaning.  Immediate questions that arise: who is the audience?  how can the visuals better communicate for the authors WHY exclusion and walls are necessary for their project? Unfortunately, the symbolism makes the authors appear to be sanctioning the separate sphere, socially and politically, of 'North America' (ONLY Canada and U.S.) 'Natives' (only if the individual is enrolled, therefore delegitimizing the trauma, violence, crisis, isolation of the non-enrolled's histories), apart from all the REST of Indigenous people of North America.  This raises many flags of English-only privilege, xenophobia, fear, hatred...  Is it worth it?  Given the rigid boundaries, and unconvincing explanations provided for them, in this text, throughout, it would help interested researchers to know a bit more, in the introduction, about the causes, reasons, explanations for taking the separatist position which marginalizes and makes 'un-normal' and 'un-natural' Indigenous people who are tribal and have land bases which are unrecognized by either the U.S., Canada and Mexico corporate-capitalist policies.  As well, it would be good for the authors to acknowledge the existence of those who they make invisible in this text.  Given the name power of the authors this is another text (of too many, sadly) generated in the U.S. academy that powerfully influence the uncritical non-Indigenous as well as the Indigenous readers who would take this as the 'bible.'  This position of separatism needs to be articulated upfront and theorized for the readership.  The title should clearly and acurrately reflect who is 'disallowed' from reading this text.  For example, define "Indigenous" in the subtitle boldly and outright! Maybe: Native Americans from the U.S. and Canada who are enrolled through the blood-quantum policy."  Then, everyone knows the agenda, upfront, and can make a decision about the usefulness and application to national, hemispheric, international, transnational, borderland, and global Indigenous issues.    Perhaps, the authors should re-think their position of control over the term "Indigenous."  It does not belong exclusively to Canadian and U.S. enrolled Indigenes.  Nor does it belong exclusively to this hemisphere, and is highly contestable as it is used in this text.  As a teacher in higher education, and an Indigenous woman, I'm not sure how and if I could use this text due to the numerous challenges and oversights it presents, as my research is primarily focused on North American Indigenous women's social movements specific to the Mexico-U.S. borderlands. I certainly COULD NOT use it in a borderlands university context where the identities of most of my students are transnational Indigenous peoples, and where their lives are impacted on a daily basis by the very problems that these authors uncritically underserve: Yaqui, T'ohono O'odham, Jumano Apache and Lipan Apache, etc.  It would certainly cause a riot and justifiable outrage due to the rigid, exclusionary and offensive positions taken.  I sincerely hope that these authors take these words, offered in collegiality and serious concern for North American Indigenous peoples whose histories, lives and human rights  their text most painfully excludes and holds separate as unequal.   
 I bought the Girls of Techno, Orig DVD, and I liked it.  Then I went to buy Girls of Techno Rave, adn Girls of Techno Hot Nights.  I was sorely disappointed, because both all 3 of them are same, with different covers.  I am planning to contact the Consumer Protection in Seattle and inform them of potential fraud by this company.  Great video, but to take advantage of customers is unbelievable!!  [... 
 John Goodall illustrates beautiful wordless books, and this is no exception (so I've given this two stars, instead of one). But unlike some of his other books our family has "read" (such as Paddy Goes Traveling), this does not have a very interesting plot. In a nutshell, two mice visit an abandoned castle, are locked inside and face a few perils -- each one easily handled by the male mouse, a knight -- before safely returning home. The characters are flat; the knight is brave, the lady timid. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but many traditional tales are far more interesting. Skip this one, especially if you have a daughter 
 This is yet another book in a long line of books from either the far right or the far left that do nothing but try to divide the country.  There is no issue that is black and white, there are more sides to issues than just the right or left.    This book may be for you if you are a mindless sheep who is to lazy to think for yourself.  And this is only my opinion.  Judge it for yourself.  
 I was really excited about getting this book, but realized why no one else had written about the trivia of Walt Disney World. I feel that the author put a lot of hard work into the book, but the info is not worth reading.. this is said by a disney fanatic who owns over 100 disney related books. This book is not worth spending the mone 
 The subject of this book is quite interesting and the knowledgable authors add many insights into the field of Mergers and Aquisitions.  However, the book is poorly written and designed.  Simply opening the book will show colorless pages and bland figures that perfectly reflect the tone and content within.  There is also a surprising number of spelling mistakes and grammatical errors (something I should not expect if I'm paying over $100 for a book).  
 It's beyond me how Mr. Schaeffer continues to find funding for his self-indulgent films.  He seems to think he's the Woody Allen for the new millennium, but nothing could be further from the truth.  Having seen two of his previous efforts, I should have known better than to give "Wirey" a try.  But I'm a forgiving soul, and I watched it.  Assuming that Mr. Schaeffer's repeated use of himself as a leading man reflects an autobiographical bent to his work, he's a misogynistic, selfish jerk who seems to think that everyone else should be interested in his inability to find romantic happiness.  Note to Eric:  Just because you know you're a jerk, that doesn't make it okay to be a jerk.  A line from "Search and Destroy" also comes to mind: "Just because it happened to you, doesn't make it interesting."  Avoid this film like the plague 
 "My edition of Demanding the Impossible was published in 1992 by HarperCollins Publishers. On p.561, Marshall writes that:    David Friedman sees such agencies as both brokers of mini- social contracts and producers of 'laws' which conform to the market demand for rules to regulate commerce. Each person would be free to subscribe to a protective association of his choice, since 'Protection from coercion is an economic good.' Apart from adumbrating The Machinery of Freedom (1973), Friedman has popularized Hayek's defense of capitalism as the best antidote to the serfdom of collectivism in books with such self-explanatory titles as Capitalism and Freedom (1962) and Free to Choose (1979).  The true author of Capitalism and Freedom and Free to Choose is of course Milton Friedman, David Friedman's non-anarchist father. Milton Friedman is not mentioned in the two preceding pages of the chapter; and in any case "Friedman" clearly is meant to refer to David Friedman. (Nor is Milton Friedman in the index or bibliography of the book, although at least Milton Friedman's books are omitted from the bibliography rather than attributed to David Friedman's authorship a second time.)   This error is so egregious that the reader can only conclude that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books that he has never even seen the cover of, much less read. Whether Marshall corrected it in a subsequent edition, or whether the error was simply corrected by the transcriber of the widely available Internet exerpt , I do not know. But even if the correction was Marshall's, for this kind of error to have made it into a published book speaks volumes.   On the same page, Marshall writes that:   The writings of Ayn Rand, a refugee from the Soviet Union, best represent the intellectual background to the new right-wing libertarianism in the United States. In her The Virtue of Selfishness: A New Concept of Egoism (1964), she attempted a philosophical defence of egoism while in her novels she portrayed a superior individual fighting the forces of collectivism, particularly in the form of the State. Her superior individual, driven by a Nietzschean will to power, appears in the guise of a capitalist entrepreneur who is presented as the source of all wealth and the creator of all progress. Rand claimed that she had a direct knowledge of objective reality, and her 'Objectivist' movement had a considerable vogue in the sixties. Like most anarcho-capitalists, she is convinced of the truth of her own views, which to others appear mere dogma.  And in my edition, the paragraph immediately ends. The next paragraph begins, "Amongst anarcho-capitalist apologists, the economist Murray Rothbard is probably the most aware of the anarchist tradition."   Again, this outrageous error has been corrected in the Internet excerpt of Demanding the Impossible. But it provides additional proof that Peter Marshall presumes to write about books and authors that he has never read. Ayn Rand's attack on anarcho-capitalism (in "The Nature of Government," one essay in her The Virtue of Selfishness) is so clear that Marshall could only make this error by failing to have even read the author whose views he is describing.   These are only two of Marshall's numerous factual errors which demonstrate a shocking lack of basic standards of scholarship. After all, a book is not a Usenet posting; one is supposed to spend months or years in study, fact-checking, re-writing, and so on.   Some similar errors appear in Ulrike Heider's Anarchism: Left, Right and Green. Once again, there are errors so gross that the only possible explanation is that Heider presumes to write about books she has never read.   A few examples of her poor scholarship:    "Menger is considered the founder of the Austrian School of Economics, which continued to refine its theory of monetary value until the middle of the 20th century. The most prominent descendent of this school of thought is is monetarist Milton Friedman, the economic authority for such politicians as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, and others." Anarchism: Left, Right, and Green, p.100.  Milton Friedman is not and never has had any affiliation with the Austrian School. In fact, he is the most famous member of the rival Chicago School, which even a minimal study of the differences between free-market economists would have revealed.   "If it weren't for their obsession with work and their misanthropic outlook, one might mistake Rand's heroes for left-wing bohemians. They are always Anglo-Saxon Americans." ibid, p.105  Francisco d'Anconia, one of the four major heroic characters in Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged is of South American nationality.   "Roark's rival, the mediocre architect Peter Keaton..."ibid  The character's name is in fact Peter Keating. While the error is trivial, it does indicate that Heider sees no need to get the basic facts straight when she discusses a book. The Fountainhead is divided into four sections, each named for one major character; "Peter Keating" is the title of the first section. It would be very hard to miss, unless you never read the book (or wrote from memory years afterwards).   Reversing her previous confusion about the Austrian vs. the Chicago schools of economics, Heider appears to attribute monetarist policy prescriptions to Rothbard: "The monetarist road out of such misery must lead through a depression, the 'painful but necessary process by which the free market rids itself of the excesses and errors of the boom.' [quotation Rothbard's] Rothbard recommends that the government do the exact opposite of what the Keynesians suggest: it should simply abandon its policy of inflation by giving the free market reign and by reinstating the gold standard." ibid, p.131.  Again, Rothbard spent the better part of his academic career attacking monetarism and the Chicago school of economics with which monetarism is associated.  I have been informed by admirers of Murray Bookchin that Heider's work contains similar gross errors about eco-anarchism. Since this is not my field of expertise, I do not presume to point them out, but it would not surprise me.   It is one thing to violently disagree with an author, and to express one's disagreement in a book. It is another matter entirely to get basic facts wrong; so wrong, in fact, that it casts doubt on whether the author read the books he or she presumes to write about. "  
 I doubt very much that Thackeray set out to write a masterpiece.  If that was his intention, he failed dismally.  Vanity Fair was first published as a serialized story, a 19th Century precursor to our soap operas.  And it reads like one.  It drags like six months' worth of "The Bold and the Beautiful".  The characters are more often anti-heroes than not.  When Thackeray writes "honest" characters one is left with more than a vague suspicion that he does not respect them.  This novel will not contribute to the moral upliftment of humanity. Thackeray did not intend it to.   In an effort to save myself from a lynching by "true believers" I will highlight some of the laudable features of the novel.  It is at times funny.  Thackeray understood bad people and draws persuasive, sympathetic sketches of their characters.  He certainly understood the mind set of the mercenary.  Many, many of his characters are mercenaries.  In fact, I formed the view that Thackeray believed that human nature is such that there must be at least one mercenary in every household.  He must have been a very sad man, or a very corrupt one.  What drew me to the novel was my admittedly morbid curiosity about nineteenth Century attitudes about race.  The subject is dealt with only in passing but the casual manner in which both the narrator and the characters cast racial slurs is fascinating.  The novel was written and set during the height of the movement for the abolition of slavery in the British Empire.  Thackeray was no high minded liberal.   Humans born with generous helpings of melanin and/or hair that curls were lesser beings; no amount of generosity of character or material wealth could remedy that.  If you are looking for innovative literary techniques or uplifting messages do not read this novel.  Read it if you like "Days of our lives".  
 This being the first book I read by Danielle Steel I expected more than what I got since I love the moive verisons of her book. The start gives it hope but near the end you can sense the direction that the book is taking and I like alittle unpredicatable stuff 
 That's what this book should have been titled. Erica Jong is, indeed, an incredible writer, but not here. Not even close. Her willingness to have two female characters candidly discuss the merits of dildos does not automatically qualify her as a feminist writer. I seriously doubt that Sappho, wherever she may now be, finds it entertaining or edifying to know that Erica Jong thought so little of her as to portray her as a dildo fan. If "Sex and the City" were still spewing out new episodes, perhaps Ms. Jong would have eventually suggested an episode featuring Sappho as a dildo salesperson and Carrie Bradshaw as her devoted dildo-loving customer.  Feminism is not about having to use "scary" words like dildo and (...)to prove how much of a woman you are. It's about knowing that you are enough of a woman to not have to prove your feminism to anyone...ever 
 This game was originally released for 10 dollars. Almost everything about it is pulled straight from Diablo and is not quite as good. Though this game has a few things about it that are interesting, and can be enjoyable to some people, I would just skip this game and go for Diablo 2 
 I have not read this book.  But I clicked on the link for information about the author, and was taken to his publisher's website.  It was filled with Mr. Capt's books, and many others on (pro) Identity movement, British Israelism, the superiority of the white race, disbelief in a literal hell, etc.  I am caucasion, and I strongly disagree with these cult beliefs, so I would not consider reading books by Mr. Capt other than to see what a twisted version of a topic from the Bible said.  Evangelicals--beware!  Make sure you know what you are getting 
 Insane. That anyone would ascribe to these ideas...let alone actually trying to apply them. I've listened to the tapes, read the books, became more incensed as I went along. Yes, there are differences between the sexes, but this guy doesn't come close to getting it right, and if you're a man following his advice, then you can write off having a long-term with an intelligent woman. This fool creates "escapes" and excuses for sheer bad behaviour of some men, claiming that it's innate to the male gender,  and would suggest that their women forgive them for it! Sure, forgive them....but expect them to grow up at some point! I support equal respect for men from women, and vice versa. If I catch you flirting with other women, and expecting carnal favors rather than gently soliciting them, then supporting your bad behaviour with this garbage book, I'll shove MISTER, (not Doctor)Gray's book where the sun don't shine. For those looking for a better appraisal than mine, please google The Rebuttal From Uranus, they really capture the truth 
 What is the exact need of academics to write their autobiographies? Case in Point: Hazel Barnes. An academic who was the first to provide a faithful translation of Sartre, she also wrote an excellent little study, An Existentialist Ethics. If she had left it at that, she might have been left with a nice little intellectual legecy, albeit, a mostly anomymous one as her books go out of print and more precise translations of Sartre become available. But she has to write her autobiography, and if there ever was a useless tome, this is surely it. Though well written, the reader will quickly come to the conclusion that there is nothing really to write about, nothing that couldn't have been captured in a magazine article for the New Yorker or the American Scholar, that is. I found it a surprise that she was, indeed, an existentialst, for she is surely among the most repressed people on the face of the earth. Not the stuff of existential heroism and certainly not the stuff to charge a person $20.00 or so dollars to read 
 The book deals with the conflicts between the moon people who are destined to die as the moon becomes airless, and the space people who are immortal and plan to go on to another star when the fuel project for which the moon was built is completed.  We are used to conflicts between groups of people, but in this case the moon people are the children of the space people.  Can you imagine raising a child to do your work and then to be abandoned to die? I could not suspend my disbelief that far 
 This is a very odd scanner. You can only program frequencies as you hear them. You cannot program frequencies using the keyboard. This scanner is virtually useless to most people. It is not a trunking scanner and you can't program favorite channels except via a very convoluted method. I own one that someone gave to me. It sits scanning marine channels. Not much use otherwise 
     This was my first reading of anything by Franzen.I picked this book up at the same time as I got "Corrections".I decided to read this book first to get a feel for his work,but must admit was very disappointed.   I found that trying to get anything out of these essays was like looking for a white dove in a snowstorm.Obviously,he believes he has what it takes to be a good novelist.Maybe he is well versed in the techniques of writing,but he doesnt seem to know what he wants to say to the reader.His essays seem to be an attempt at observation,but he can't seem to pull his thoughts together and present a conclusion to the reader.   His concern about the literary novel going the way of the vinyl disc or the rotary phone,reminds me that it is the message not the medium that is important.   Maybe he has found his calling as a teacher of literary mechanics and should just leave the writing of novels to the gifted who know what they want to say and have the fire in their belly to pursue that path.   In his last essay ,it appears he drifts somewhere between being liberal or socialist minded;and maybe that is the problem.He is not happy with the way things are,doesn't know what would satisfy him and can't suggest any solution.Maybe he should start searching out some people who are positive,satisfied and successful.   Oh well,I guess I'll still give "Corrections" a try.Let's hope I like it better than this one 
 Too much detailed information left out. Nothing but mumbo jumbo. Be careful 
 I just find it deeply ironic that there seems to be such an effort to accomodate a Jew who has become Buddhist and insists that this is not a violation of her "Yiddishkeit", and the opposition to Jews who choose to believe in Jesus and yet remain Jewish 
 This was an excellent book except for one glaring exception and that is the author sprinkled verses of scripture throughout the book.  I found her bible thumbing quite jarring and inappropriate and I plan to return the book despite its rich content.  Perhaps Mrs. Smith should have warned her readers by properly titling the book something like "When Your Christian Hormones Go Haywire" or "Solutions for Christian Women over 40" 
 The literature of September 11 is never attacked.  When a book speaks of September 11 (or of terrorism in general), it is more or less guaranteed immunity from criticism; it will almost inescapably be greeted with sympathy.  Jonathan Safran Foer's EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE banks on such sympathy, on such reverence.  The narrative, which concerns a nine-year-old boy named Oskar Schell in search of a key that would unlock / unshell the enigma of his dead father (a narrative stolen, in its basic outline, from Guenther Grass's DIE BLECHTROMMEL), could have been written entirely without its scattered references to the terrorist interventions.  Nor is this trauma the only one presented in the novel: the others include Hiroshima / Nagasaki, the Staten Island Ferry crash, and the Dresden bombings.  Each disaster is generalized to the point at which what is addressed is not a traumatizing event in its specificity, but historical "trauma" itself and the overcoming of trauma through bereavement-inspired creation.  Oskar, the insufferable brat, attempts to complete the work of mourning for his father, Thomas Schell, Jr., a victim of September 11, by compiling an almanac of self-inflicted wounds, the collage of images and letters which is the book we are "reading"---an almanac which, most likely, is written sometime in the indefinite future (Thomas Shell, Sr.'s manuscript of 4/12/78 is heavily edited (pp. 208-216).  Who has done the editing?  Almost certainly an older version of his grandson Oskar).  If the term, "reading" even applies.  Whenever a "pregnant" image is described, Foer literally re-presents it in the form of a pictorial image.  When a flock of birds rises into the sky, it is not enough that we read of these birds---we must see them as well.  Words may not be left in their invisibility; we are presented with supplementary photographs, illustrations, since mere verbality is not enough.  (Indeed, the entire novel oozes with misologos --- the mistrust or hatred of language --- in terms of both its content and its form.)  Photographs, yes, and also a superabundance of blank pages and nearly blank pages.  Space is not used in the manner it is in the works of Edmond Jabes, for instance.  Typography does not substitute for a well-wrought sentence.  Foer abrogates himself of all responsibilities --- most specifically, the responsibility to write well.  Why bother when the pyrotechnics of typography are at his disposal?  As far as the writing is concerned, it is composed of nothing other than mind-numbingly, soul-deadeningly repetitive phrases ("heavy boots," "raison d'etre," etc.) and Sunday school platitudes: "Sometimes one simply wants to disappear" (184); "There's nothing wrong with not understanding yourself" (184); "Everything that's born has to die, which means our lives are like skyscrapers" (245); "How can you say I love you to someone you love?...  It's always necessary" (314).  Whenever the author writes something that he finds "beautiful" and "true" (165), he congratulates himself on his brilliance and tells us that that thing is "beautiful" and "true."  The entire book reeks of such unearned profundity.  We also learn that most dust is made up of human detritus---a very deep truth indeed, one that Foer also communicates in his essay, "Emptiness" (originally published in PLAYBOY) with all of the sanctimoniousness and self-righteousness of the faux naif who serves as the center of the novel, a Sunday school lecture in which we learn that famous musicians (Ringo Star) and scientists (Stephen Hawking) are unthreateningly approachable: everything is familiarized.  Perhaps it is wrong to criticize Foer for including so many blank pages in EXTREMELY LOUD AND INCREDIBLY CLOSE, since the entire book is a vacuum: null space into which readers may project their own meanings.

 As many have stated before me the book starts off with great promise for people who like historical fiction, however midway it turns into a romance novel.  I give it 3 stars for holding my attention.  A good beach read that can get you thinking (a little) about a time past.  The one star is a mistake and I cannot seem to change it.   3 ***  stars 
 While the first publishing of Irrational Exuberance in early 2000 was indeed timely and prescient, that was a long time ago in the financial markets. Shiller now trots out the same arguments in 2005 about the housing market, adding some notes to the preface and a new 2nd introductory chapter about home prices. This is disappointing because all it says is there is a lack of consistent long term price data on houses, so we end up with detailed data about U.S. cities. Location matters in real estate, not so much for stock prices, but that doesn't seem to make much difference to Shiller. Yes, home prices have been relatively less "exuberant" in Cleveland, but how vibrant is Cleveland in the global economy? There are other commentaries I've seen which go in much greater depth about the housing market. I'll buy the argument that prices have increased, but I won't accept Shiller's innuendo that home prices are the same type of market as stock prices. There's not much meat here for real estate analysis, so if you get this book, it's just another historical analysis of things like the tulip mania and other bubbles. I should write a book like that, since there is so much material available to package, and I've seen several books that flog the "insights" for all they are worth.  This includes Holland, as any good book on bubbles must, through a paragraph about homes on the Herengracht canal in Amsterdam. The validity of this metric is that the buildings haven't changed much on the outside in almost 400 years. The real (inflation adjusted) price gain works out to 0.2% per year. Cool, in the long run real estate prices just beat inflation. Does that translate into a prediction of imminent collapse in global housing prices? I'm not sure you can connect those dots. In the long run, prices will equalize somehow. Shiller doesn't add anything to the discussion of how that equilibrium will be achieved 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 This was the first technical book that I have bought somewhere other than Amazon in a while, and it reminded me why I tend to avoid that section of physical bookstores.  One gets the feeling that the author was learning OCaml while writing this book.  He makes reference to several concepts that he does not explain.  Monadic computation and polymorphism are two terms used that I feel the author did not actually understand while composing the book.  In fact, if a book spends several paragraphs (badly) addressing the topic of polymorphism in a particular language, it should not leave it off with,"OCaml has polymorphic classes similar to C++ and Java, but the polymorphism at the type level in OCaml is parametric polymorphism instead of object polymorphism.  The subtleties of the differences are well beyond the scope of this book..." and go on to direct the readers to a Usenet group.  There are also a number of forward references in the book -- rather than presenting only concepts that have been presented to that point in the book, there are numerous concepts mentioned or used and then annotated with,"This will be discussed in a later chapter," sometimes with no real reference allowing a read ahead.  Other complaints revolve around the typography of the book.  It's bad enough to be misleading and confusing rather than just annoying.  Critical characters are left out, which in the descriptions of the toplevel imply that certain things that should be marked as input will appear as output.  If you didn't already know a little OCaml before picking up this book, you might think that you had typed something incorrectly, or were using the wrong version of the language environment, or have the wrong modules loaded.  I would recommend not buying this book and reading one of the online tutorials along with as many open source utilities as possible.  A good book is inevitable, but this book doesn't even have a good page 
 My 3 year old loves making patterns with her snap beads. I was so excited to find these beads with the cute designs. However, I was very disappointed when they arrived. The plastic is too thick, making the beads very heavy. They do not stay together well at all. We ended up buying her some of the "original" snap beads and giving these away. 
 I, also, must second Mark Twain. This book is a waste of time! Why do teachers make us read it when we should be reading Tolkien, GK Chesterton, CS Lewis, and the like? Agh. Then, that could just be my wacky taste in novels...   But this was bad. Oh my gosh!!! The descriptions were ALWAYS needlessly long, the conversations ALWAYS needlessly long, the... blah, blah, blah, blah. That's what the whole thing was. Blah. The whole plot could have been totally condensed to a hecka short 200 pg novel and it would have been a million times better! Maybe even good! And I like long books!   This book is terrible. Listen to the warning of a fellow voracious reader and do not waste your time! 
 I cannot pin point it down however I found this album release almost impossible to listen too. Every song sounded too rough and jagged for my ears and the songs seemed to not flow together like they do expertly in other FLA releases. This is a release from 1992 at the beginnings of FLA. I am slowly getting every FLA album from first to latest. I have normally been able to find at least one song to like but on this album all the songs were rough and sounded like I was listening to a car manufacturing plant in progress. 
 I was sadly misled by all these glowing reviews. You'd have to be a herbologist or a wizard from Hogwarts to make these remedies. It's annoying how they keep calling the dog or cat "your companion." And there was nothing in the index about spraying or behaviorial problems.  A shopping mistake for me 
 This book was on a very interseting topic. The author took time in studying this topic. It was about the impending world oil shortage. That is the time when we, the world, will run out of oil. It tells you about Hubbert's analysis of the time or year when the world will run out of oil. They then talk about a lot of other things like where oil comes from. Then they talk about where oil is. They also talk about drilling for oil. They say it takes people over 20 drills to find oil. sometimes it will take even more time then that. Then they talk about the size of oil fields. They also reexamine Hubbert's analysis later on in the book. Rate plots is brought up because the more people driving the less oil we will have in the future. They talk about the future to fossil fuels and discuss elctricity and natural gases. They also talk about how much we already have so when oil runs out we need to think about all the stuff we already have. Hubbert was a brilliant man. some gas companys tried to make him stay quiet but he didn't want to he told everybody. The author was ver knowledgable and I could tell he knew what he was talking about.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody unless they are very smart and want to know about the impending world oil shortage. I say again the author took time in studying this topic but that was his downfall in that he went into to much depth and made it boring. When you read it you can tell the author knew what he was talking about but he got to much into detail which is very boring. I gave it a low rating because I have a short attenion span so it was hard enough for me to make it through this book 
 Wow this pitiful attempt is exactly what Ann Coulter has been talking about since "Slander."  Including the belief that showing an unflattering picture of someone actually proves that they're stupid and their ideas are evil.  Clearly all the visceral hatred posing as content is the intellectual and psychological equivalent of putting ones hand over ones ears and chanting "la la la," except it involves a mind boggling level of hatred. Hatred of hearing what you know is true, and thus don't have the means to logically debate.  This necessitates so called "progressives" need to destroy Coulter before her wisdom and insights (which none of these authors could hope to equal) destroy their world and priviliges 
    Reilly fans will probably find his latest novel to be quite a disappointment. For some reason, Reilly forsakes all the things that made his earlier books great.  Instead, this novel is a thinly disguised political statement which reveals Reilly's prejudices against various governments and religions. The plot is obviously borrowed from "The Da Vinci Code" and the characters are one-dimensional pawns whose main purpose is to verbalize Reilly's personal ideology.  For the first time in a Reilly book, I managed to finish the book out of sheer determination rather than out of any interest in the plot or characters. 
 Don't know about anyone else, but the DVD I purchased had lousy video.  The only good shots were of closeups and sometimes it took the cameraman a few seconds to focus on a number of the shots. All of the long distance shots were grainy and not clear and the medium range shots were not good either. I know the concert was indoors, but I've seen other indoor videos that did not have this problem.  Did I get a bad DVD or did anyone else have this problem 
 I believe that this book is not at all helpfull since it does not explain thouroughly the material. It just provides the reader with tables and calculations that sometimes are not easily understood. Moreover it refers to important material such as the calculation of VAR in SWAPS and FRAs without really explaining!! 
 We bought this booster when my son was 18 months old as he loved to sit like his parents.  However, he is a very large boy (35" and 34 lbs) and the tray could not fit over his legs comfortably.  So we took off the tray so he could sit at the table, and he uses the holes where the tray attaches to stick food.  We went back to the high chair without the tray - and he is perfectly happy.  We use this seat when visiting relatives which is nice it is so portable, but then spend time afterwards cleaning up the food underneath the seat where he stuck the food

 "Why geography matters" did not deliver according to me. Though it may be very interesting for people not very familiar with geography and how it does matter in ordinary life as well as for global issues, it seemed to me anyone a bit aware of these very issues will not learn much 
 This got dirty quick and Mr. Spongebob bathed in my sink quick a bit. Very cute idea, it's cheap enough but be advised it get's gross....quick 
 This book is dated; the law changes at least one a month, sometimes more often. Your examiner doesn't live or work in the past or regard out-dated laws as useful tools for business. You will never know what is current, right or wrong when you trust a dated law book. NO. NO, NO, NO, GET SOMETHING NEWER 
 This is the most boring book I've read in the series! I've read all her books and I couldn't wait to finish this one. I can't believe I finished it in the first place! It has no plot and you can tell who did it very early in the storyline (if you want to call it a storyline). I wouldn't waste money buying this one. Get it from your library! The rumors about this one being ghostwritten have got to be true. I can't imagine Braun writing like this! 
 This book is just like the last 10 books by Stephanie Laurens. Domineering nobleman who can't bring himself to say "I love you." Insipid lady who is willing to have hot sex every night but won't marry until said domineering nobleman says he loves her. Endless descriptions of really boring sex, with something faintly resembling a plot stuck in between the sex scenes.  This book is a waste of perfectly good trees. At least I got it from the library.. 
 I am a great admirer of some of Steinbeck's books. Grapes of Wrath is among my top ten.  East of Eden is unspeakably bad. It thrashes cliches out until they smell of putrefaction. The brother conflict, rather than being a modernization of the first biblical murder story, is an exaggeration in kitsch than can hardly be surpassed. So is the story of the incredible evil woman, the mother. So is the good Chinese in his great goodness. It makes me grow new goose bumps just to remember the extremes that Steinbeck went into as far as sentimentality goes. There is not a single real person in here. The book is a rambler. It walks about the countryside of it's story like a gentleman with nothing better to do. It gives you heaps of little pearls that wait for the rescue from the swine. It throws aphorisms at you when you start drowning in the pulp. In Germany we had a special genre for this kind of writing: the Heimatroman. This is one. I enjoyed and cursed it till the end. And then I watched the movie. Boy, was James Dean a bad actor, you wouldn't believe it. It got an Oscar in it's days as best movie? Oh boy. There is absolutely nothing right in the movie. And that made me realize the difference: the movie is so bad, you can not possibly stand it till the end. The book however is a monument of artistic provocation. I couldn't put it away. I dumped the DVD though 
 Had long looked forward to finally reading this "acclaimed" novel. There are brilliant and imaginative highlights in the book, although finding those bits is like looking for light in a black hole , a lot of work for very little result. I truly believe this is a book that would be more interesting if one increased their medication level way past the recommended daily dosage.  Mark 
 Hi, I am writing this review in an attempt to help you save $10. This magazine is an embarrassment in every angle. It is full of pictures of "sexy" boys/men dressed in cloths no guy with self esteem would ever wear. And pictures is all there is, for you that think there will be something interesting to read, read this: THERE IS NOTHING IN THIS MAGAZINE TO READ!!! The latest issue contains of 48 (forty-eight) pages before you get to this issues contents. The first "article" starts on page 126 (!) and is about "why a man would like to slice of his testicles"! Totally the magazine contains of 260 pages and there is text (letters that forms sentences) on about 40 of them. Besides this, the magazine also has a huge dilemma of being a gay magazine or not.  Well I can go on and on but I won't. Unfortunately I have a subscription and I am going to see if I can get it canceled, I don't even need my money back. Take your $10 and run them in the disposal, it will be more fun to clean out the disposal than "read" this magazine 
 It was ok, if you like that kids of movie, but not for the mother in me 
 Among the reviewers, I am in a minority that does not think this book is such a high achievement. It is a mixture of facts and speculation, with theoretical terminology superimposed upon them. There is no clear criterion why some facts are included and others are excluded, and I have no idea what the lesson of this book is supposed to be. In fact, this is a self-indulgent exercise in historical erudition. I don't care what anybody else says, this is a philosophy rather than history book. The author gives a lot of facts, but he also frequently mistakes logical constucts for facts. The author tries to integrate almost everything under the Sun into this tome, and that is why he ends up with a bloated work that oppresses the reader with needless information 
 Karen Clark new cd its not over, there is only two songs that I like on there. The main song I really like is He Never Will. That song really makes me feel happy, I get happy when I listen to that song. I am a great fan of the Clark Sisters. I am a gospel recording artist myself, but I haven't came out yet. But God has told me that I was going to be out there! Then I am hoping to sing with them on my CD when the Lord brings me out. So look for me, My name is Marie Bell Nero. Look for me I will be out soon! God Bless You

 It would have been better if it had not been a duplicate of many other Native Stories I have read- just with a different tribe.  I don't wish to make light of their situation in that boarding school, I just wish it would have had more about the families and their traditions-things that are unique to that trib 
 I picked up this O'Conner book because every once in awhile I hear about her being "the definitive voice of the South" or "very disturbing" - I like disturbing and since I'm not overly familiar with the South, the definitive voice of it seems a good place to start.  But I just couldn't do it.  I read maybe 4 stories before I had to put it down for good.  I found the characterizations sophomoric and, well -- I suspect the overt, unsubtle, judgemental observations constantly being offered were snide parody, read in this day of self-consciousness they read like pandering to the lowest common denominator.  Timely, maybe.  Timeless, it's not 
 The original. He was kind of cool, but now he ain't; people using his backwardness against us. Forget this dude, or perish. 1896 speech was a total sell out to da man.  Drop ya boots, dawg!!! I 
 "To the Lighthouse" is the first book by Virginia Woolf I have read, aside from the first volume of her diary, and I was greatly disappointed.  I felt that this was just a juxtaposition of random thoughts spewed onto the page, without any consistency or coherency.  This is the first book I did not read word-for-word, and even skimming it was painful.  I do not recommend 
 ****this review is NOT for the superbit version***** The 2 star rating is not for the movie, but the fact that the description on this site says its widescreen; it kind of sucks when you get the movie in the mail, it says on the movie case its widescreen, yet its full screen, not much you can do.  Can someone at Amazon change the product description to reflect whats going on?  It would help out 
 I bought this CD because it got a couple of very high ratings but it's really not that good. The arrangements are all new and though I do like some of them for the most part I found this version of the musical to be hollow and soulless. Songs that I really liked in the original are no where to be found. To begin with 'Clusters of Crocus' is completely gone which really disappointed me as I found it a hauntingly beautiful doorway into the world of 'The Secret Garden.' 'The House Upon the Hill' is also missing which is a great shame because I felt it set the stage of Misselthwaite Manor perfectly. 'There's A Man' is gone as well robbing you of a great deal of insight into the characters of Archie, Neville, Lily and Rose. And most of the songs that remain are somehow missing something essential. 'If I Had A Fine White Horse' has lost it's charm, 'Winter's on the Wing' has lost it's wonder, 'Wick' has no magic, and most terrible of all, 'How Could I Ever Know' is devoid of it's ethereal enchantment. As for the performers, I think Daisy Eagan from the original Broadway cast made a far better Mary in regards to acting and singing. And the Lily on this album is a pale shadow of the remarkable performance given by Rebecca Luker in the Broadway version. Alison Fraser and John Cameron Mitchell from the Broadway cast also made a better Martha and Dickon. As I said I did like some of the new arrangements, 'Prologue,' 'Garden Suite 1' and 'The Storm' for example. And I did like some of the performances on this CD, Colin is actually better and Archie is very good though he lacks a bit of Mandy Patinkin's panache. However, the majority of the songs are definitely inferior to what you find on the Original Broadway Cast recording. So, unless you are an absolute 'Secret Garden' diehard don't waste your money on this, get the Broadway version of the musical 
 This movie is a total waste of time.  Even Audrey Hepburn can't save it, but she didn't have much to work with.  She drifts about the whole movie dressed in what seems to be a long flour sack and bare feet, putting curses on her grandfather and making eyes at Anthony Perkins, who is supposed to be from South America but has no accent at all.  Even the locales are confused, with part of the movie looking like it was filmed in the Amazon and part in the desert southwest.  I love Audrey, but I wouldn't own this movie even if I taped it for nothing off AMC or Turner classic 
 Boom! Crash! Bang! Boom! Rat-a-tat-a-tat! There - I've just summed up S.W.A.T. for you. Starring Samuel L. Jackson (the second coolest black man in Hollywood) and Naughty Boy of The Moment, Colin Farrell, this run of the mill police shoot 'em up is average. And by average I mean that when something is supposed to go boom, it does. There's little to no ingenuity, little to no originality, heck, they even brought the catchy S.W.A.T. theme back (updated of course). The good guys are cool, the bad guys are bad, and that's about the size of it. The one thing that really bothered me was seeing the wonderful Michelle Rodriguez co-starring as the stereotypical Tough Latina Girl (tm). After a wonderful screen debut in "Girlfight" (go rent it now!), she has yet to star in anything resembling good since then. "Resident Evil", "The Fast and the Furious", "Blue Crush". In every single one, she's Tough Latina Girl, and that's just a shame. It was also a treat to see Jeremy Renner as the S.W.A.T. cop gone bad, as I'd seen him audition and get the role in Bravo TV's "The IT Factor" a year earlier. So the bottom line is - if you're looking for a good film, then try elsewhere. If you're looking for something to stare at on your television screen for an hour or two, without any danger of thought or emotion, then S.W.A.T. will do just fine, but if you like your police work with character and emotion, go rent "Homicide" directed by David Mamet 
 They could have crammed alot more vagina in there. If they title something vagina monolgues it ought to be all about vagina.  I don't want to hear alot of whining about Bosnia and the Salem Witch Trials.  Give me vagina, vagina and more vagina 
 The pictures and concept are very enticing, but stick to Lego and Playmobil for durability.  The Imaginext set we purchased was hard for a 6yr old to assemble.  The pieces don't stay together easily, so right now it is in pieces all over the floor.  Not much fun for the 6-yr old in the long run and not fun for Mom! 
 I was really looking forward to movie.  My goal was to expand my understanding of this historical period.  Many of the scenes looked like they used old sets from the 50's Westerns and the lighting technique was disappointing, these alone did not turn me off from watching.  My real gripe about the movie was the dialogue and the acting.  Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, a stage coach is robbed, my attention was drawn to the portrayals by the actors.  They were not believable and the dialogue just sounded like something that came out of book for young readers.  Later, when alerted that the posse is nearly upon them, the other rider responds with such uncharacterist language for a male ruffian that I laughed.  As the movie plodded forward, scene after scene left me wondering, how quickly was this thrown together and how come they didn't rehearse more.  I felt my patience to endure several more hours an unfair punishment.  I generally try to watch a movie entirely but frankly, I think it was an embarrassment and waste of time.  Maybe it got better (that is why I gave it two stars) but I find that doubtful.  I am wondering if both Tom Berrenger and the other author missed to many classes of Script Writing 101. 
 I have just finished this lengthy and mundane tome. 564 pages of this author's ponderous personal philosophy,  gratuitous sexual dysfunction, constant and maddeningly self ingratiating referrals to classical music and composers, discussions on all the authors that ever walked the earth, and when finished with all the above, a good little story that could have been written with one third the pages.  As if all this were not enough, Styron pulls out every lengthy, obsolete, and arcane word that he can find with which to propel his story along. (One can imagine him, loaded with whiskey--which he freely admits to being his greatest source of inspiration--pouring over every dictionary and thesauras written in an attempt to impress the reader, or, at least the liberal East Coast intelligensia.)The end effect for the reader is a constant slowing of momentum of the narrative, in order to look up a new and confusing word every five minutes. (One does, however, come to learn what "simulacrum" means; he uses the word some 15 or more times throughout this laborious read.)  I will not go into the story, save to mention the three major plot lines: that it is one of about 10,000 treatments of the after effects of concentration camps; a love story about a deeply scarred woman, having endured life in one of the camps, and a mentally deranged man; and a young Southern writer coming to grips with culture shock in Brooklyn--this being Styron, or Stingo, as he endearingly calls himself in the story. In one of the more compelling passages in the book he realizes that he no longer wants to live in the South and turns back to the squalid and sewer like life of New York. Being from the South, and after having slogged through this tedious read, I only wish that he had been belched into the Northeast sooner.       
 I'm 49, post-menopausal, and I love the Golden Girls, Erma Bombeck, and The View, but that type of sharp humor is not in this book. This author's humor is mild and corny, with LOTS of capitalized words. You know, for EMPHASIS! That said, it's pleasant to read. Companionable, but not terribly compelling. A nice book for the nightstand, to pick up now and then 
 I was hoping this book would provide insights into how to present complex information in a more comprehensible, useful format, using PowerPoint as the tool. Instead, the overall gist of this book is that presentations should be "dumbed down" as much as possible. The theme the author presents is that presentations should be story based. This is reasonable. However, the method the author recommends is that essentially *all* meaningful, complex (or, as the author prefers "boring") content be removed from the presentation. Presentations then become nothing more than catchy headlines and colorful graphics. All content should be in the presenter's notes (not typically to be provided). This is juvenile and useless and frankly reflects a complete lack of understanding of how presentations are made in a complex business environment. 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 The author has done a good job of scouring the antenna literature and summarizing all of the equations in one place.  The problem is the lack of any discussion about what the equations mean.  I am reminded of the definition of a college education given by Prof. McWhorter of Stanford, "the process of the professors notes becoming the student's notes without having passed through the mind of either."  If you are an experienced antenna designer, this book will be of help.  If you want to learn from scratch, try the 50 year old book by Kraus 
 This review is more for O'Malley himself than his book. I attended one of O'Malleys courses and took it seriously. The silent question I had walking into the course "Are we alone in the universe?"  At the time of taking the course I was an admitted agnostic and thought perhaps O'Malley could clarify some things for me. At the beginning of the course, and his book, he talks about freedom of thought and allowing the evidence to form the conclusions. Okay, fine. I read his book the first week of class and did all my homework assignments. In class he said we should feel free to discuss. So whenever he would bring up something that didn't ring true or the evidence he chose was selective I would bring it up, hoping he could, if at all, explain to me why I am wrong. I had previously studied philosophy, having read Nietzsche, Sartre, Plato, Aristotle, Kierkegaard, and even a little Aquinas, so I wasn't just putting  out random, insignificant  babble. However, despite O'Malley's claim of taking in all the evidence and allowing it to form it's own conclusion he strongly clings to his preset ideas and, like most people, becomes threatened when they are challenged.  As a result of my hard work and sincerity I was given a D. Had O'Malley stated that he only wants us to repeat what he said then I would have done that and kept my criticism to myself with just a little disclaimer on each paper that the content of the paper is according to O`Malley and/or the Church. However, he emphasized being humble to the truth and told us to be critical so that's what I did. For that he gave me a D.    Eventually I did get signposts to the answers I was looking for through reading Alan Watts and Eckhart Tolle which are very different than what O'Malley spouts 
 A quick 136 page read is not all bad, however the author Jeffrey Gitomer, keeps telling us of Patterson's principles and then sends us to his (Gitomer) website to register for the anwser. I contend this is unauthentic marketing and a contradiction to Jeffery's claim of giving value. GIVE US WHAT WE PAID FOR AND THEN TRY TO SELL US. This is the perfect example of what not to do in sales. He assumes I have read his other books and that what he says is gold. Please give me what I pay for next time, if there is one.  
 I agree that this is a really fun toy--my kids loved them while they lasted.  We bought two for Christmas and they both broke within a few weeks, and it wasn't because of rough treatment.  You can tell that they are definitely cheaply made.  Too bad, the features were cool, as other reviewers have described 
 After reading Blood Of Heaven I was quite eager to read Threshold.  Blood of Heaven was a book that I could not put down.  I cared a great deal about the characters  and the storyline was extremely captivating.  I was so eager to find out what was going to happen next.  I read the book in 3-4 days.  Well with Threhold I was majorly disappointed.  The storyline was interesting, however I really did not like where he took the premise.  The story was not as focused as Blood of Heaven, Myers seemed unsure of what he really wanted to do with this book.  Some of the characters were interesting, however many of them really did not interest me.  Most of the secondary characters  were not developed at all, they were just there.  Thier backgrounds and motivations were really not developed.  The main character of Brandon was somewhat interesting, however he seemed like a weak character to base a book around, Sarah was a far more interesting.  My biggest problem with the book was trying to visualize many of Brandon's visions, they become more outlandish and outright silly as the book went on.  Brandon's final confrontation at the end did absolutely nothing for me, I could not take it seriously at all.  Years ago when I used to read Stephen King he was able to make just about anything believable, no matter how bizarre and out there it may have been.  That most definately was not the case with Threshold.  Overall I found parts of the book enjoyable.  I did like the resolution and the development of Brandon's abilities.  This book really did not grab me.   I have just started Fire of Heaven, I do hope I am not disappointed with that one 
 This book purports to be a Dictionary of American political slang but should be entitled "Washington D.C." political slang.  To test out the book, I looked up some commonly used Chicago political slang terms.  None of them appeared in the book.  Had the author bothered to look outside the Beltway, he could have found words like "chinaman" (a political sponsor/source of clout) and "fetcher" (a legislative bill proposed solely for the purpose of generating campaign contributions from an affected industry) 
 I've used the same straightener for the past four years and have always been able to get my naturally curly hair perfectly straight.  This past Christmas though I got the Conair Tourmaline Ceramic Straightener as a gift and decided to try it out.  Not only did it not work for anything, it pulled my hair and broke it at every pass.  Also, it took more than twice as long as my normal straightener.  Needless to say, I'll be taking this back for an exchange.  I suggest the normal flat panel straightener for anyone with naturally curly hair 
 Unfortunately this is another book contains the same information as all the past written books on pharmaceutical sales.  It seems mr. Melfa spends most of the time "tooting his horn"  then focusing on the subject at hand...selling pharmaceuticals.  I would save your money 
 What a disappointment!  The authors answer to binge-eating is simply eliminating all sugar, flour, fat, caffeine, or whatever your trigger foods are from your diet.  Not only that, but they insist you must weigh and measure your food all the time for the rest of your life.  Thats hardly what I consider freeing yourself from obsessing about food.  They actually recommend keeping an emergency food kit in your car to be sure you always have measuring cups, a food scale, and several cans of safe food available to you at all times.  Perhaps this is wise advice for people who are morbidly obese, but for those of us who are at a normal weight, or only slightly over, and are looking for some insight and realistic advice on dealing with compulsive/binge eating, this book is NOT the answer 
 How much of human history has been shaped by catastrophic events?  This exhaustively researched document seems like a natural place to find the answer.  Unfortunately, the author's fascination with lurid details of human torture and dismemberment caused me to put the book down after just 60 blood-soaked pages.  It's pretty clear that Mr. Key's interests in history do not run parallel to my own.  I also found myself wondering about Key's qualifications as "Archaeological Journalist."   I guess there are plenty of people who like reading tabloid-style history, and good luck to them, but I much prefer a calmer and scientific perspective of Derek Ager, in his book "The New Catastrophism, The Importance of the Rare Event in Geological History." -- Auralg 
 This may be a good book for seomone who is not familiar with any form of mind body medicine, yoga, meditation, ect. For me, it was very conventional, not at all progressive..basically just talks about simple relaxtion techniques that are pretty common. And, it is kind of an infomercial for her training programs. I kept waiting for the book to get better or inspiring and it just never did. 
 This was my first Carlotta Carlyle book, and I thought it was boring. I will not read another one. I love murder/mystery books and this was not a page turner. The ending was very disappointing 
 Sometimes I've enjoyed books by David Baldacci (WISH YOU WELL and THE WINNER come to mind); others, such as THE LAST MAN STANDING did little for me . . . add SPLIT SECOND, which I just heard, to that latter list . . . it was a disappointing mystery thriller about two disgraced Secret Service agents who come together to solve two campaign-trail crimes . . . I cared little about any of the characters, and there were far too many subplots floating around for my taste . . . the ending also didn't do much for me, as it brought too many separate threads together in too quick a fashion . . . lastly, I did not particularly "buy" the man behind the crimes; he just wasn't  all that believable. 
  Obsidian Butterfly is the ninth book in a series which follows the ups and downs of a private eye in a version of our world populated with werewolves and vampires.  Obsidian Butterfly is simply bad, very bad on many levels.  If Anne Rice and James Elroy had a child, and the child were a 13-year-old girl who didn't like to read but wrote a novel anyway, the result might be something like Laurel Hamilton's book.  Foremost to me was the ignorance, disrespect and abuse the author shows for language.  Let me say it most clearly: a professional writer who uses words incorrectly is stupid, sloppy and lazy.  Not or.  And.  An editor who allows such sloppiness to slide by simply isn't an editor.    One example: in a brief bit of self-congratulation Anita prides herself on her ability to prefabricate.  Clearly the author was looking for fabricate or prevaricate.  But prefabricate just does not mean fabricate, prevaricate or lie.  Another example: the folksy Ted persona of Edward describes a particularly hot day as a barnburner. As any dictionary will show, barnburner does not mean hot day.  It means great spectacle.  The folksy people who use the word know that.  Authors who throw it in for folksy charm should know it as well.  Editors should know it -- it's in the dictionary for God's sake.  Her next crime is the kidnapping of the word preternatural.  I think I understand the literary device that she is attempting to use, that is, preternatural is shorthand for all of the things that exist in Anita's world, that do not exist in ours: vampires, shape-shifters, zombies etc.  Thus we have the FBI special unit for preternatural crimes, Anita's expertise on the preternatural, etc.  But even though I understand the literary device she's trying to use, I think it stinks.  Preternatural is not the same as supernatural, nor is it an arcane or archaic version of the word.  A preternatural ability is an ability greater than that occurring in nature.  A supernatural ability is an ability that exists outside of nature.  One can be preternaturally strong, fast, clever or prescient.  One cannot be preternaturally invisible, immortal or telepathic. Hamilton's co-opting of this word, shows either ignorance of or apathy to its meaning.  Further one is left to wonder if the word supernatural exists in her world, and if so, to what it might refer?  Jargon.  The author is a believer in the use of jargon to give the ring of authenticity.  To that end about a dozen times we are treated to characters being told to put up their guns, rather than to put them down or away.  Real cops and bad guys may speak that way; I don't know.  The problem is that the mix-in of jargon did not match the rest of the speech, and made much of the dialog sound phony.  Further, since both the bad and good guys use the same jargon, you need to count off odd or even to know who is speaking.  In his excellent book On Writing Stephen King, quoting Amy Tan, laments that interviewers never ask the so-called `popular' writers such as King and Tan about language.  Such questions are reserved for the John Updikes and T.C. Boyles of the world.  Upon reading Obsidian Butterfly I think I can offer an explanation as to why.    According to the back cover copy, Obsidian Butterfly as well as many others in the series, were New York Times bestsellers.  Given that, it might be tempting for one who has read neither Laurell K. Hamilton nor Stephen King to regrettably group them together.  
 The notion of "interpretive communities" is at best derivative of Kuhn's classical work, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and at worst a framework of obstruction employed against those who wish to revivify literary theory and criticism in the wake of postmodern hegemony 
 Perhaps the most outlandish and misguided book ever published on the  subject. Despite an appealing premise,  the writer fails to deliver  anything resembling a guide for a successful marriage.  In its place, we  get ultra-conservative hogwash that will surely doom any couple to an  unhappy marriage. Indeed, no self-respecting woman will tolerate a husband  who accepts Andelin's advice. Written by a dentist, the book recommends a  course of action that will prove more painful than a visit to his dental  office.  This book would make a hilarious read if it were not meant to  influence naive young men. Get "Letters to Philip" by Charlie  Shedd, or anything else on the subject, instead 
 Eww! I read this book because it was recommended in a well-known woman's magazine. Obviously, it was a paid review. Boring, unbelieveable, poor character development, I didn't care about the characters and the story was PREDICTABLE.  This is the only book by Norah Roberts I have ever read, and I have no reason to want to read others. If you like to read confession magazines and formulaic romance novels, perhaps you will like Montana Sky too, although it is a step down from the worst romance novel I ever read.  I read the entire book...I kept waiting for it to take off.  Don't buy this book, don't even waste your time borrowing it from the library. It really is that bad 
 Seven Times The Sun is not for everyone. It could be a springboard, offering times of the day and night where parents might want to incorporate some kind of rituals to provide their children with a stable and balanced life. But the songs, poems and traditions offered in Shea Darian's book are hokey and contrived at best, cumbersome and artificial at worst. None of the other reviews indicated the religious or spiritual aspect of the book. Darian is a minister, and all of the poems and songs have a subtle religious bent. True, parents should teach children to be thankful for all they have. But I'm just thankful Amazon has a customer-friendly return policy 
 Amazon's review for this is ridiculous; "zeppelin's one true disappointing album" (what about hourses of the holy, precense, in through the out door hmm?) "there is some classic material here"?!?! I have no idea what they're talking about. This is the worst "odds and sods" album ever released. Its truly insane to listen to this, and think this is what the band thought was good stuff to release from the vaults. It shows Page's poor mental state at the time; he seems to have truly lost it due to heroin.   Or maybe this is all the stuff that was in the vaults? That seems unlikely, but perhaps that's the only way to explain this. Did they really release everything they recorded? The mind boggles! Nobody does that; you don't record 12 songs for a 12 song album, you record 30, 35 and whittle it down to the best songs. If Zeppelin truly just recorded and released everything they wrote, that would be amazing. It would be unlike any other band ever.  Sorry I dwell so long on that. It's just I do not want to talk about "the music" on this album. Its so incompatiable with Zeppelin's legacy, and it is truly a complete embarasment to the band, or it should be. This stuff doesn't even qualify for THE FIRM for Gods sake! As cynical as I am about Led Zeppelin, they could really get me rocking at their best; they were majestic, mythical, AND rocking, all at the same time! They were a good band with good music, that always at least had interesting sounding material. This stuff wouldn't have made the grade on the sex pistols album; its that bad.  Don't buy this; even if you're vaguely interested, don't buy this. If you like Zeppelin, you won't after this! Or maybe you'll just be a drone and use words like "lost classic." If you do, you are a goofy SOB 
 Amazon strung me along for months before delivering only one volume of the five volume set.  Get it somewhere else 
 I think this book has six, maybe seven periods in the whole book.    Ok, so I might be exaggerating.  However, I literally counted eight pages between two periods.  This entire book is one long run-on sentence.  If I had written this way in my college courses, I would have received an appropriate failing grade.  Besides being incredibly difficult to read (because you keep wanting to insert a period) the plot of the book is nearly non-existent and develops slowly, and utterly fails to hold the reader's interest.  I will NOT be recommending this novel to my friends or family. :-) 
 I think this quote from a review sums this up the best - "As we all know, we have the power to rule ourselves. This being said, what are we waiting for?"  If this were in a book from the world, I would expect a statement like that, but from a professing Christian?  I had control of my life for years and it progressively drove me further and further away from God.  Having control of our own life is the PROBLEM, not the solution.  The solution lies in surrendering control of our lives to the God who created us, not continuing in rebellion against Him.  When I was the ruler of my own life, it led to me breaking every single one of his moral codes that He gave to mankind.  Just look at them (the ten commandments) -   1. I thought I was fine with this one - I didn't believe in Allah or Zeus or any other gods. Of course, I was still nowhere near keeping this one ("don't have any other Gods before me") - there were plenty of other things I put in my life before God. I'd rather sleep in than go to church. I'd rather watch tv than read the Bible, etc.   2. I thought I was fine with this one because I didn't make any silly carved gods or idols. But I still made a god in my image. Every time I would say "why would God..." or "my God wouldn't..." or "I don't think God would...." I was making up a god in my image. Coincidentally enough, it was always happy with the things I was doing, but He was going to get all those other "bad" people. (Also, if you agree with Dr. Schuller that the key to knowing God is self-love and a positive attitude, you're guiltly of breaking this one also)  3. OK, I knew I was guilty of taking the Lord's name in vain and using it as a profanity, which was bad enough, but I was even worse than that. I was calling myself a Christian, yet I lived with my wife for years before getting married, never attended church or even had any idea what the Bible said and basically just living a competely ungodly lifestyle. While using God as a profanity is violating this commandment, what I was doing was taking the Lord's name (i.e. calling myself a CHRISTian) in vain in an even worse sense.   4. I would also admit I was guilty of this one. No matter how you want to interpret the sabbath law, I wasn't putting aside any days for God, they were all for me.   5. Honor your father and mother? Not even close. 'Nuff said.   6. Don't murder? Good, I'm fine on that one - oh wait, Jesus said that whoever hates anyone is a murderer. Got me on that one too.   7. No adultery? I was fine on this one too, I never cheated on my wife. Of course, as I already mentioned, I lived with her for years before we got married. I didn't see this as wrong because I had no idea whatsoever of the seriousness of this in God's eyes. Under God's law the penalty for adultery or any sexual sin was the same as murder. In the New Testament, it is clear that even professing Christians who don't honor their marriage commitments are only fooling themselves. That's because marriage isn't about us. Sure it's a wonderful, beautiful thing for us, but more importantly it was designed as an earthly expression of God's love for His people. Corrupting that gives a distorted picture of who God is which is why it is so badly under attack today, even from professing Christians. Some people think that if you're a Christian, you have to stop liking sex. Not true at all, I love sex. The Bible has a whole book in it about sex. According to 1 Corinthians 7 saying "not tonight dear, I have a headache" is a sin (and just before the guys get too excited about that one, it says that our bodies don't belong to ourselves, but to our spouses, and while the concept is obviously sexual, I think that if your wife wants to use your body to take out the garbage or do the dishes, that qualifies too). But God designed it and it needs to be done his way (and of course I disagreed with this, which took me back to the second commandment). But even more so - I was really in trouble with this one because Jesus said that whoever looks at a woman with lust has already commited adultery. Well, I was in trouble there.   8. Don't steal anything? Well, I never stole anything big so I was fine. Doesn't matter, even when I stole toilet paper from the buildings on campus so that we wouldn't have to buy any for our apartment in college, that's still stealing.   9. Don't lie. See my comments on honor your father and mother (which is actually kind of ironic, since when I tried to proclaim my honesty, sometimes I'd say "well, I lie to my parents sometimes, but that's ok.")   10. Don't covet. See those same comments again. Don't want something that doesn't belong to you - if I told you that I've always kept this commandment, you'd probably die laughing and you don't even know me.   But God's a loving God?  (these quotations are all from the New Testament and written TO CHRISTIANS)  "Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God." (1 Cor 6:9-10)  "For this you know, that no fornicator, unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not be partakers with them." (Eph 5:5-7)  "Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." (Gal 5:19-21)  The reason Dr. Schuller's television show and books are so popular is because people want to feel good about themselves while continuing in their sins and yet still feel that somehow they'll still get to go to heaven when they die.  But there's one problem with this - why did Jesus have to die?  Dr. Schuller's gospel has no answer for this question.  But the Bible does.  The Bible looks at the sins that you and I have committed (and after reading that list, if you can honestly say that you have not sinned.... well, I have no answer for that other than to pray for you) and say that we deserve hell.  Hell is a real place (not just low self-esteem or any kind of hell on earth that we can imagine) full of pain and torture.  It's what we deserve, but God loves us and doesn't want us to go there.  So He took all those sins that you and I have committed and paid the price for them Himself.  He took the penalty for our transgressions so that we don't have to.  That's the true Gospel, and you can accept that forgiveness.  All you need to do is stop believing in a self-love gospel and recognize sin for what it is - sin.  Then turn from those sins and put your full trust in Jesus.  Stop reading these books and start reading God's Word - the Holy Bible.  He will not let you down.  You will move from death to life, your final destination will change from hell to heaven.  Please at least take the time to look into what I'm saying.  Right now there's a million and one things I'd rather be doing (and some I should be doing) than typing a review for something I completely disagree with, but I'm doing this for the exact reason that I mentioned above - HELL IS REAL WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT!  God doesn't want you to go there (just look at all the agony He suffered so you wouldn't have to) and I don't want you to either.

 Undeniably well researched, thought out, considered, and at times extremely thought- provoking.  I also understand this author is well above me in terms of education and brilliance.  I will not deny that by any  means. HOWEVER... The language in the book is written in such vocabulary as  to steal away most of the impact of the book.  I would quote an example,  though I am not sure it that is appropriate here so I will not.  Endless  sentences mixing in with the vocabulary make it a major struggle to get  through.  If language is not a barrier to you, then I will recommend this  book, but for the casual reader, the typical university student, or the  typical teacher, I must say it will be a very difficult read 
 This book was not covered in details for almost very subject in import and export.  Some examples are complete mismatched with the text.  It is over rated by other reviewer.  I learned about import/export from the US custom web site and the internet more than the content of this book.  It is not worth the money or time to read.   
 this book is like many others and the characters emotions just don't speak to me. it seemed like a kind of uniform book. If you want GOOD end of the world themed books you should try the Fire-us trilogy

 I am a huge fan of the RPG genre and have played just about every one for the PC.  Morrowind is the most boring one I have ever played.  I turned it off after two evenings of SLOWLY walking around, having stupid repetitive conversations with NPCs, and lamely fighting rats.  The interface is terrible.  You are very limited in what you can carry, so after you kill a monster you can't even carry your treasure back to town.  This "game" was all work with no fun.  Do not buy 
 If you are looking for practical, hard hitting insight and knowledge you can use as a practising manager, totally BYPASS this wordy, ivory tower compendium of theoretical jargon 
 One out of every 4 discs would fail on me when I'd burn to this media at 4x. Slowing down the burn to 2x didn't help either! I own a Sony DRU500A with the latest firmware. Memorex isn't on their compatibility list. Lesson learned: check the compatibility list BEFORE buying 
 I'm afraid, very afraid for the Preston/Child team. I loved their early books and recommended them to countless friends. But their latest offerings (specifically, Brimstone and its sequel, The Book of the Dead) show signs of too much fame and too much formula. They're writing less well and they're trying to write "blockbusters," hoping, I imagine, for that booty call from Hollywood. Significant portions of both Brimstone and BotD are set in Italy - and we know what that means, don't we? It means, "We've caved in to pressure from agents/publishers/Satan and decided to try to shove our way onto Dan Brown's overcrowded coattails." It's a little bit sickening, really. In books like Thunderhead and Mount Dragon, you felt you were in the hands of someone who knew the territory he was describing--knew it inside and out, and could take you there. P & C's Italy is generic, google-search, Lonely Planet Italy. Sure, they've been there. Who hasn't? But it isn't what they really know well, and the result is a warmed-over hash of Italian sterotypes and shibboleths that make you shake your head in disappointment. Doug, Lincoln: Why'd you do it? Brimstone isn't a terrible book, though there are at least a half dozen particulars of the central mystery that the authors never explain or wrap up. What's terrible is that it's like 50 other assembly-line thrillers, and their books, once upon a time, were unique. Now that the Wal-Martization of the Preston/Child franchise is nearly complete, I worry that there's going to be less and less reason to keep shopping here 
 After looking at the third edition, I ordered this book for a class that I teach. The fourth edition contains many changes, all of them for the worse. The literary selections in the 4th edition are not as well chosen; the added paragraphs in the chapters on New Criticism and feminism are stylistically awkward and often confusing and repetitive, not to mention factually questionable (the claim that there were no voices in feminism between Pisan and Wollstonecraft!). Most distressing of all, this edition was apparently rushed to press in time for classes in fall 2006, for it contains typos about every five or six pages. The chapter on feminism alone has at least ten errors, e.g., "one in the same," "least" instead of "lest" (that mistake was carried over from the third edition), "lastest"!!!, inconsistency in verb number after "a variety of [plural nouns]," etc. The publisher should send an apology to all purchasers of this book, along with a list of errata. On the bright side: I tell my students that I can't penalize them too much for small errors, when the textbook contains so many 
 You can't write a mystery without a solution and call it "pulp" or "noir" in my book.  Those of you who are fans of King's writing will find this readable, but hardly enjoyable.  Those who are not would do well to stay away.  We're halfway through the book before we're even introduced to the "mystery", and we're finished the book before we're told that there's no solution to it.   And worst of all, none of this seems to bother the Downeast characters narrating the tale 
 I find it utterly disturbing how simple it is for a talented D.J. to round up 3 bafoons and exploit their childish and idiotic personalites all for their dirty dollar; Ripping off the kids droned and purged on the MTV feedbag, and this man Paul Wall probably gets under my skin more then any of them.  Notice his rhymes don't descend any futher than his mouth, his car and his money. What excactly does that say to me about my life or the world around me? Does it reach artistic heights?  Or is it just another jackass looking for his 15 minutes of fame?   And still people eat it up like Chicken N Dumplin's on a cold winter's day  This is excactly whats very wrong with today's hip hop, it's all capitalizing on mindless club music artistic talent is down the toilet infinitely  Stay away from this awful garbage  don't let MTV rob another cen 
 Although the setting and factors involved appear to be intriguing they just come off as "boring".  The characters are stale and PLEASE the endless details of the streets, roads, mountainside - NOT necessary.  I'm truly disappointed because up to this point I have had nothing but the highest praise for Daniel Silva's works.  But, like someone else pointed out in another review - something happens when an author writes about the same characters over and over.  I believe Mr. Silva has gotten just about all he can out of Gabriel Allon, et al - and I was disappointed when I discovered that although he had thought to put an end to the character Gabriel Allon in his latest book he was advised by some friends NOT to.  Too bad - I know I won't buy that one.  I LOVE to read and "consume" a book in a relatively short time period given my busy schedule.  Yet, I've been "trudging" through this one for weeks - not days 
 This book is really disappointing. When the it was delivered at home, I thought the box was empty: the book is as thin as a magazine! The content is very theorical, completely useless for executives.  Maybe OK for students who have no clue at all about what strategy is, but definitely useless for executives.  
 I just finished Lead to Succeed this a.m and I'm back at amazon to order 3 more for my key employees. This book had common sense ideas that can be related to any business in the growth mode. I'm not a big basketball fan, but I certainly am a fan of the wisdom of Mr. Pitino. The book was a wealth of knowledge and information,very entertaining and a book that I could not put down till I finished. Pass it on, it will encourage anyone to strive to become the best 
 I've enjoyed the Inspector Banks series in the past (particularly "Final Account" which had a great twist in the last few pages), but "Innocent Graves" is all talk and very little pay-off.  Banks himself continues to be an interesting character, and Robinson's writing is never less than superb, but this particular mystery was a big "who cares?" for me.  The mystery itself isn't really much of a mystery and its solution has more to do with blind luck and a piece of evidence that just happens to appear, like a deus ex machina at the last moment, than it does with any brilliant deduction on Banks's part.  "Innocent Graves" seems far more interested in the psychology of the suspects (one in particular, whose story concludes in an all too predictable fashion) than in satisfying its readers with a great solution to the crime.  I've always found this kind of mystery a bit of a bore; give me a couple of corpses and some brilliant twists and I'm happy.  There are a couple of corpses here, but no twist; just a far too unbelievable and uninteresting ending 
 My friend was going to toss this CD but gave it to me. As the title suggests, something revolutionary was supposed to happen.  Unfortunately, DJ Spooky's efforts are a mish-mosh of noise, tired AOL samples, video game  music & wrecked techno 
 I am never happy when a purchase requires that you install the company's software.  The vid is encrypted so that you need Amazon's player to view it.  Blah.  You're better off buying the DVD for $20 with all the episodes so at least you can watch the DVD somewhere other than your own computer.  
 I agree with Jane who says that the glass bowl is very thin and can break very easily. Ours broke with very little pressure during cleaning. We went to a thrift store and bought a larger bowl made of heavy glass for just 50 cents. Our Betta is now swimming around more and the bowl is nearly break-proof 
 When merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from Switchblade Syphony, one can only be disappointed in Diva Destruction's music.  The positive aspect is the better production on this CD compared to their debut 
 The chain was very thin and fragile.  The locket, itself, stopped closing properly within 3 days.  I plan to send it back for a refund.  Pretty, but piece of junk 
 this ablum mad me loose a lot of respect for this band. dont bull this . get some of there earlier stuff 
 I've read a few books of all kinds.  "Modern Pace Handicapping" is one of the worst, frankly, which makes it definitely the worst racing-related book I've ever read.  It's particularly sad when it is supposed to be teaching you something and not just narrating a story.  I understand the concept of pace handicapping, but the nuts and bolts hardly fit together in this work.  I'm surprised I got any theory out of this book at all.  It is truly one of the most poorly written/edited/formatted/arranged books I've run across.  It is shocking this book gets so many rave reviews.  "MPH" is so badly written I can only assume the people giving it 4+ stars are already well-versed in pace handicapping and skipped over all the incomprehensible stuff and the myriad mistakes and horrible copies.  If I wanted to spend more time I could give specific examples by leafing any given page in the book.  However, I'll just sum up by saying this book was riddled with:  -typos; -chopped-off paragraphs (turn the page - what happened?); -confusing mish-mash of decimal system proper, and using decimal notation to represent FIFTHS (i.e., 1:35.3 = 1:35-3/5 in one section, and in another it represents exactly what it looks like to an engineer like myself - 1:35-3/10); -many extremely poor (completely illegible, high-bleed) copies of old race charts; -poor math-checking - both of equation form and of results in examples; -disconnected charts to text (text discussion on page X, charts were on page X-5, etc); -poor explanation of either general theory, methods or examples - especially - WHY SHOULD I PICK THIS OR THAT RACE AS A TYPICAL PACELINE?  Author acts as if it is so obvious and simply states "this should be the paceline" too many times.  I could probably go on; I always manage to find a new glitch when I recommence reading.  There are so many categories of problems that I cannot keep track of them all.  I'm not sure if "Modern Pace Handicapping" is so poorly edited and explained that I find it hard to pick UP (as opposed to "hard to put down!"), or if I can really say the narrative style itself is so dry as to have made me take 2 years to read it on casual time.  (Not finished yet - a few more chapters, which may mean another 6 months.)  I have started and finished a couple other books on casual time in that period!  It is almost with dread that I attempt again.  I give it a 2 only because I could actually get the general idea from MPH.  I think I could handle calculations, but I'm still confused as to why a particular race in the past-performances is good to use as a predictor for the future race analysis.  The Andrew Beyer books are based on a different concept, but despite involving math and what could be a dry subject, they were definitely better written and MUCH better edited (and as with this subject, I knew little about it when beginning but was curious) 
 In this book the well known Dr. Ferber tells us that he is a "specialist" in sleep. He doesn't mention that he is a speciallist in CHILD sleep behaviors at Harvard and NOT an infant sleep behaviors. He doesn't mention that he NEVER works with infants at Harvard and that Brazelton is Harvards infant sleep specialist. (yes there are big differences between an infants ability to sleep and an 8 year olds)  In this book Dr. Ferber tells you to let your child "cry it out" with an occasional check on your child to make sure hes ok and let him know you are still around...even though scientific studies have proven infants don't gain a sense of permanance (ie: they think when you leave the room you are gone forever) until around 7 months of age. Bower and Wishart:1972,   Johnson, M. H., & Siegler, R. S.:1997,  harvard study. Brazelton & Als: 1980 and many more have proven this and Brazeltons countinuing INFANT research at Harvard continues to support this.  And FERBER himself NOW suggests the you do NOT ever use the Ferber method unless your child is at least 6 months old... however that is not what it states in his ORIGINAL book as it was written in the 80's (30 years ago) and unless someone is getting this very new, revised edition they will not know this (As well most parents will totoally disregard this anyways) However in this new, updated version (the new version only) he does go a little bit into building a good night time ritual and rocking and singing to your child as well as Before you "Ferberize," you should make sure that feeding habits, pain, stress (like a child who is screaming and crying isn't going to be stressed) or medications are not causing or contributing to your baby's sleep problems.   In this book Ferber as well suggests in this updated book that, not only should you let your child cry it out but that you shouldn't pick them up. And EVEN if your child is hyper-ventilting from being so upset (wouldn't you love your child to pass out because then he'd be quiet), or is throwing up (which can cause dehydration not to mention its painful) not to pick up your child, but just to clean him off "as best as you can" and lay him back down and leave.  It's a parents job to ensure that all your baby's needs are met. What could be more in need then a infant who can do nothing for himeself, cannot even speak, who is screaming out for help and is trowing up all over. I mean what kind of mother would listen to a man when she feels guilt in her heart and sees her child gettign sick. I feel guilty when I lie, I feel guilty when I break a promise, I know when I feel guilty I am doing something WRONG.  And ensuring a childs needs are meat means not just physically but emotionally as well, Ferber never goes into any aspects of the childs emotional health in this book because he knows it is just another form of ignoring another human begin. Does The advice in this book work..yes it will work for almost anyone, I could beat my kid silly to get him to clean his room..it would work but certainly would be a cruel choice.   Do you know toddlers and infants have no sense of time. Its not just when you say "5 minutes honey" and they say "are we there yet" one minute latter, infants have even less sense of any sort of time, and 5 minutes of crying when they are scared, lonely, or confused can seem like an eternity.  When I am sad I like a hug from a friend, when I need help I would hate my husband if he just ignored me when I asked for help. Why should we treat our children different. Because its to much work?   If you just can't put the effort into taking care of your child day AND night like most people then this book is for you, but be sure to get the revised edition, not the 30 year old version 
 Reading this book I couldn't suppress a suspicions that this book was written for PR purposes. The people who wrote it are, undoubtedly, very knowledgeable in their area - i.e. the oil industry, but still... Many pages are dedicated to how the US government had been trying to put a straitjacket on the oil industry. Another theme is inefficiency and greed of oil-producing countries. The only `sacred cow' in the book is The Big oil, and unfortunately it is excluded form meaningful critical analysis. From my perspective, the book's goal is make you feel good about oil industry. It is a good book for that purpose. Unfortunately, although it presents some tidbits of really curios information, this book is essentially shallow. I would recommend it for a college student who wants to join oil industry, but isn't sure. This book would cement his or her decision. But if you seek a truly good book on the subject go for 'The Prize' by Daniel Yergin. I am reading it now and I believe it is more balanced and simply more interesting 
 The essays were moderately amusing, but not a good use of my time. If you want short amusing essays, go for something like Gig or I Thought My Father Was God instead.  The advice given is often too general or too pointless to be useful (e.g., To Keep Warm -- eat right, keep your body in shape, have the right equipment; To Conduct a Background Investigation -- hire a private detective).  Maybe two of the essays were valuable if you really don't know how to tie a Winsor knot or a bow tie, but this isn't really the best way to find out because you'll never remember that the information is here and that's what the internet is for anyway 
 I hate AC/DC, them and Metallica are extremely overrated in the metal department.  As musicians, these guys are very average AT BEST, most of the time, they're below average.  It doesn't matter if it's Bon Scott or Brian Johnson singing for them, AC/DC has always sucked.  Unlike other metal bands like Slayer and Sepultura, AC/DC's songs are very cheesy and boring, the only thing this is good for is the whiff of nostalgia.  Want real 80's metal (not glam)?  Go for Slayer, Sepultura, Kreator, Exodus, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Mercyful Fate, Hellhammer and many others 
 This book is probably a Phd dissertation. It spends a lot of time focused on sorting out trivial or outmoded arguments about Cezanne and how his art was created. All the while, the author offers little of any insight of his own other than his own highly equivocal attitude towards Cezanne. He obviously got bored writing this because Cezanne is a great and exciting artist but you would not know it from this author. Any doubts about what I am saying? Read the last paragraph of the book. 
 There are some good hints here, but do not be mislead by the title.   For a complete book on Disneyland and California Adventure, I highly recommend Birnbaum's Disneyland Resort 2003, Expert Advice From The Inside Source.  Birnbaum's Disneyland is updated annually and published every year 
 I bought the Explorist which I am generally happy with, but this software is lousy and there is no product support for it on the website.  The version I have 2.0 has not been updated to work well with the Explorist, and the 64MB limitation is a pain when you have a 512MB SD card.  In general, the routing works but the interface is nowhere near as good as Streets and Trips 
 Being in the fire service for nearly 10 years and an instructor, this book does well for individuals with a decent level of fire knowledge.  However, for the fundamental student or beginner fire fighter, this book lacks serious explinations of the basic concepts.  This book has done nothing but confuse students with it's constant bombardment of calculations without providing clear explinations. Outside sources are constantly used to supliment what this book lacks. If it's used for a begining Fire Engineering or as a suppliment book for Fire Behavior, I would recommend it.  But the lack of the fundamentals that it mystically tries to build on, is extremely frustrating and lacks any sort of foundation. Advanced levels - I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5 Beginner levels - I'd give it a 1 out of  
 This book (The Return of anti-Semitism) is merely a catalog of the rise in modern anti-Semitism. It ultimately fails deeply and thoroughly by not even attempting to explain the reasons for anti-Semitism or the solutions to anti-Semitism. Indeed, the author even seems quite proud to brag about not knowing the reasons or solutions. It is as if he is so horror struck at the mere thought of anti-Semitism that he feels his only job is to point it out so that the whole world too can be equally horror struck with guilt. Being horror struck, however, is not a sensible or just policy.     It's true that in America we are still horror struck and guilty about anti-Semitism, largely as a result of our particular moral disgust at the German holocaust. Accordingly we always support the Israeli gov't, although nobody really knows where this policy came from or why we pursue it despite the world wide hatred toward us that it has engendered, and the direct connection to 9/11. We don't dare risk sounding anti-Semitic by suggesting  that if we had supported a just peace (internationally built and defended wall at internationally recognized borders) in the Middle East rather than blindly supported the Israeli occupation, 9/11 would probably not have happened. After all, the terrorist are over here because we're over there.       When Likud came to power in Israel they openly swore Israel would no longer be a "dwarf state" and that they were not occupying the West Bank but rather liberating Judea and Sumeria according to Biblical prophesy. Much of Israel does not support this blatantly imperialist, racist policy; yet America does out of a blind dumb fear of being or feeling anti-Semitic. You can admire us a little for being so sweet,  but how practical  is our sweetness and dumbness when directly and indirectly it caused 9/11 and makes us hated by much of the world? As long as we blindly give Israel the weapons to kill Muslims in the West Bank how can we blame Muslims for thinking of us as Western Crusaders or Zionist occupiers, and much of the rest of the world for hating us as Texas sized bullies?     The author completely ignores the core issues causing much of modern anti-Semitism and the possible solutions, because he prefers to manipulatively capitalize on the Holocaust guilt that has served Likud's deadly occupation of the Muslim West Bank so well. We can no longer blindly pretend, as this author does, that modern anti-semitism can exist separately from American's and Israel's 50 year war against the Muslim West Bank 
 If Amazon had a Half Star, or better yet, a No Star rating I would have used the latter. Powers spends the first seven pages talking about his pimple dilemma then goes on to his tediously constructed random subjects with shallow character development laced with corny humor. I get the feeling throughout the book of the author's desperate attempt to be funny. 
 This novel started out pretty good in that I didn't know where Koontz was going with Martie's panic attacks and fear of herself.  It seemed to take FOREVER for anything to actually happen. The antagonist was a caricature.  So over-the-top, it was a job getting through each page. If this had been my first Koontz novel, I probably wouldn't bother with a second. 
    This story was seriously depressing, and was in no way a book that I would call enjoyable. 
 I am dissappointed in the fact that you are not offering a more updated edition - there is a 9th edition and also the 10th which came out novemeber 2002 - which I had to buy a local bookstor 
 If I am not mistaken,this is Jonathan Kellerman's third book involving a suspect religious cult.  It gets a little tiresome.  The plot was not as suspenseful as his books usually are.  But it is easy reading, and the writing is entertaining enough to read if you are a Jonathan Kellerman fan 
 This was a waste of time.  Lora needs to work on her story lines and character development.  There's more to romance than porn 
 ...and I can remember some of the scenes to this day (i'm 49 now). I was 16;my friend,17 at the time. I used to hitchhike to and from her house a lot in those days,and after that movie, I didn't-for a long time. At the time it was a really scary film,and the urban legend at the time was that it was based on a true story,which only added to the starkness of it. Of course,as some have opined here, what is perceived as horrifying then and what's considered horrifying now is like comparing oranges and rutabagas."Horror-and-brutality technology" in films has definitely-and I use this word wryly-evolved 
 I was able to finish this book, unlike Gilead but this author is soooo boring!  Will not read another by her, no matter what the reviews 
 ?The Storm Upon Us ? everything seems new and strange ? nothing seems certain ? masses of people are tangibly deprived of their claims to self-sufficiency ? this revolution is steadily creating the predicate for its own collapse ? the prospect of an economic or political cataclysm of unknown dimension ? .? These and similar claims are found on just the first two pages of the book. To be fair, Mr. Greider also references the ?great fortunes? thrown off by globalization and the fact that millions escape poverty, but right from the start you get the feeling that he is working backwards from his conclusions and choosing his rhetoric and his examples to sell his point of view. It?s almost as if Mr. Greider is suggesting that, now that the West has gone through the very sort of radical transformation he describes with shock and dismay, the rest of humanity should just stay where they are at while we in the industrialized world figure out if and how they should reach for the security and the lifestyle that we take for granted. If you are looking to validate an anti-globalization bias you already hold then this may be the book for you, but I think it?s fair to say that most readers would like to benefit from Mr. Greider?s considerable experience and expertise without having to interpret his selective or overly cynical presentation. In a nutshell, my problem with the book is not that it argues against globalization and is wrong, but that it is as committed to persuasion as it is to education. I chose not to finish the book and will look for a more neutral resource 
 Bob did an excellant job on Derivative Securities and a horrible job with this book.  All the tree pictures packed with discount bond prices, rates and risk neutral prob just confuse people even more.  Read Derivative  Securities and you would understand how HJM works better 
 Anytime the Christian Right has a chance to undermine women,it will take that chance and run with it.Please read "The Myth Of Gender" by Fausto- Sterling.Your eyes will be open to new possiblities for your life and family.The whole point of Dobson's book is to controll people so they fall into a limited mindset - male or female,with no room for the individual.The individual is reality not this sexist nonsense.I have always found it more easy to be out in the world and explore.Dobson makes women sound like natural cowards and fools.Very insulting 
 Kofi Annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that.  Kofi Annan: The Peacekeeper is ironic in that Annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the UN, support for Arafar, etc.  Jeff Jacoby recently wrote that he is basically a symptom of UN's sickness.  Jacoby noted that just last week, Annan  woke up to a Wall Street Journal column by Glenn Harlan Reynolds, publisher of the influential InstaPundit website, urging that he be replaced by Vaclav Havel, the much-admired former president of the Czech Republic.  In The New York Times, op-ed eminence William Safire reviewed the revelations that link the massive oil-for-food scandal to Annan's own family: Until this year, his son Kojo was getting monthly payments from a firm that had a major oil-for-food contract with the UN -- even though he'd left the company in 1998. The corruption enveloping the UN will not begin to dissipate, Safire wrote, until Annan resigns, "having, through initial ineptitude and final obstructionism, brought dishonor on the Secretariat of the United Nations."  Meanwhile, the latest National Review was out, with its cover photo of Annan and the headline, in large red letters: "You're Fired!" An editorial inside insisted that "Annan should either resign, if he is honorable, or be removed, if he is not," while an essay by Nile Gardiner, a former aide to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, explained why "Kofi's hour is up." With his record, Gardiner observed, "if Annan were the CEO of a Fortune 500 company . . . he would have been forced to resign months ago."  On Wednesday came another call for Annan's ouster, this one from the chairman of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has amassed evidence that Saddam Hussein used stolen oil-for-food dollars to underwrite terrorism and suborn at least one senior UN official. It is "abundantly clear" that Kofi Annan should resign, Senator Norm Coleman said. "As long as Mr. Annan remains in charge, the world will never be able to learn the full extent of the bribes, kickbacks, and under-the-table payments that took place under the UN's collective nose."  But odds are the world won't much care about getting to the bottom of the latest UN scandal. UN scandals rarely provoke lasting outrage. There was no global uproar when the brutal regime in Libya was chosen to chair the UN's Human Rights Commission. Nothing happened to the UN after its troops allowed Serbs to slaughter 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the "safe haven" of Srebrenica. Sex scandals seem to erupt wherever the UN goes -- the latest involves charges of rape, child abuse, and prostitution by UN personnel in the Congo -- but they never cause heads to roll in Turtle Bay. Annan himself became secretary general despite his failure, when he headed the UN's peacekeeping operations, to pay attention to warnings of genocide in Rwanda.  Why should anything be different this time? Oil-for-food may be the greatest international rip-off of modern times, it may have strengthened one of the world's bloodiest dictators, but if history is any guide, the scandal headlines will fade from view long before the secretary general does. By week's end, in fact, dozens of governments, including all the permanent members of the Security Council save the United States, had publicly rallied to Annan's support. Scandal or no scandal, he will almost certainly serve out the remaining two years of his term.  Which is just as well. Annan is merely a symptom of the UN's sickness, not the cause of it. His resignation would do nothing to reform the UN into the engine of peace and liberty its founders envisioned. Better that Annan remain in place as a symbol of UN fecklessness and failure, and a spur to those who can envision something better.  The UN is a corrupt institution, one that long ago squandered whatever moral legitimacy it had. The UN's founding documents venerate justice and human rights, but for the past 40 years, the organization has been dominated by a bloc of states -- essentially the Afro-Asian Third World -- most of whose governments routinely pervert justice and violate human rights.  Inside the United Nations, there is no difference between a dictatorship or a democracy: Each gets exactly one vote in the General Assembly. The reason the UN indulges vicious regimes like those in North Korea, Syria, and Cuba is that they are members in good standing, and most other governments lack the courage to cross them. The UN cannot be fixed unless that changes -- and that isn't going to change.  Kofi is a bad man 
 Well, I didn't really hate it. After reading others by this author, I snapped up the Hacker & the Ants when I saw it. I finished it only because  it kept seeming capable of being redeemed. It wasn't. I was very disappointed. Looking at the publication dates of this and his others will tell you all you need to know 
 The first two songs are amazing, the rest of the cd lags. I cant think of what else to write hah 
 I thought I had never met a book on statistics I didn't like (i.e., find something useful therein), until I met this book. I bought it in spite of other reviews that mentioned glaring errors that had not been fixed. I felt I knew enough about statistics to fix the errors, and I was interested primarily in the application of statistics to toxicology, for which topic few good texts exist. However, I could never have imagined the monumental scale of the corrections needed.  In this book (supposedly in its 3rd edition), in my opinion there is essentially NOTHING in the text without errors and omissions, except possibly the SAS programs given, which are possibly useful to the neophyte in SAS. Formulae are unintelligible, missing parentheses and using improper symbols and typesetting. Symbols are referenced that are never defined, etc. Apparently the author just created a montage of clips from other works without regard to antecedent explanation and had zero concern for correctness (he should be ashamed).   Finally, in my opinion, the author does not appear from his writings to be the expert in the field that one would expect from the book title. He does appear to be a toxicologist, but his knowledge of statistics appears rudimentary and confused.  I was truly disappointed by this book, because my needs remain unsatisfied. Its true value lies solely in the table of contents (so you can look up elsewhere the techniques referenced) and the SAS program snippets. Everything else is untrustworthy, incomplete and generally contaminated by errors. If the author cared the least bit about accuracy and content, he could have made his book enormously more useful in the 1st, 2nd or 3rd edition. The eternal optimist may hope for this in the 4th edition 
 As a practicing L.A., I have bought several McGraw-Hill Construction Books.  I get a similar result each time:  They seem on first look to fulfill the promise, but I found they don't well serve the need in real life.  I get far better use out of Architectural Graphic Standards, and I'm looking forward to Wiley's Landscape Architectural Graphic Standards 
 This book attempts to empower women using man-based criteria.  When will authors like Lasara realize that women's power is through their sexual attractiveness?  She must know this as she uses a sexually charged title for her book as well as a sexually charged cover!  This book does nothing more than demean men.  Subsequentially, women are demeaned by aspiring to be nothing more than simply men.  Women have a power all their own.  They get the free drinks at the bar, as well as promotions at work. Why?  Because they are hot!  My partner and I bought this book thinking it could bring more excitement to our practices.  What a disappointment!  You truly can't judge a book by its cover!! 
 I imagine this movie might be funny if you're really into dog shows.  I'm not, so I couldn't tell you.  Mediocre at best.  "This is Spinal Tap" was better 
 This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters are unlikeable except for Charity's two friends. The songs are far too long and I had to fast forward through most of them because they were so dull. I was especially disappointed with Big Spender because I love the song and expected a spectacular dance number from Bob Fosse and all they did was stand there draped over the bar. The only redeeming factor was that Sammy Davis Jr. was in it. He's awesome even though the song was fairly stupid. This was my first Shirley MacLaine film and on the back it said that Sweet Charity was her best movie. I have no desire to see her other movies then 
 I bought this one after reading some reviews here, and I am regretting it after I was able to watch it.  All the episodes were terrble.  It made me blush, because it was really that bad.  I think I wasted my money on this one 
 I have no clue what this little thing is about. Dummy me thought I bought a nice little tv, but it reminds me of those little cards you'd get with chewing gum and every time you moved it in your hand, the image changed. That's what you experience when you move around in the room and still want to follow a show. You cannot watch this thing with somebody else seated, say, 15 feet away from you. The other person (or you) gets a foggy image, or just dark shapes. Up close you see hardly anything. Buyers beware: this is not a working tv. One star for the batteries in the remote... 
 The journal is not nearly indepth enough to do you any favors as far as tracking your progress.  Wish I had known that before I purchased.  What is should contain is spaces for information to go along with the book, like your answers to the very important question about "Why do you want to lose weight", which Mr. Green stresses is just as important as the number of calories or food types one consumes per day.....  A weekly journal is not for one just starting the program.  Until you have changed your eating habits, a daily journal would give you a better handle on progress and habit changes needed to be successful.  
 This book had a good message, and could have had a lasting impact on me. But the plot was obscenely dull, and the middle of the book (Gene and Finny relationship) does not seem to fit in with the rest of the book. Not recommended 
 This is nothing less than the story of an African American man's struggle to define himself within the context of the 60's US black power movement exploited by a white Englishman. Mike Marqusee brings nothing new to the story of Muhamed Ali other than stilted prose and an uncritical eye. It fails as a book about boxing and is equally weak with respect to Ali's struggle with the white establishment of his day. Marqusee's attempt to embrace Ali's story serves only to water down the true struggle of an entire generation against the evils of institutional racism 
 Why would a photo artist choose a large format for Polariod-sized pictures?  That's what you get with Andreas Bitesnich's Pola Nude.  There is not one picture in the entire book that takes up more than half the page.  With approximately 60% of the pages what you get is two polariod-sized pictures side by side-- quarter-inch white borders and the rest is black background.  I get so tired trying to see what the picture is about, that I literally get fatigued looking at this book.  Many of the pictures seem interesting.  However, with much of the magic of the human form obscured by small format photos lost in a sea of black, there are too few rewards to justify the price.      
 This book is for a school student doing their studies.  The information is very general and there isnt any information about salaries!  It really doesnt help if you are trying to descide what type of amimal career you are  trying to get into 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
   we have not recieved this book yet please let us know the status or refund the purchase price 
 Most of the proofs that the Morrises give are well thought-out with good  evidence.  However, when they start talking about creation, they base their  proofs on traditions instead of scripture and natural revelation. No matter  how hard the Morrises try, their personal creation theology has never stood  up.  This section stands out like a sore thumb out of what could have been  a great book 
 The idea of this book -- a collection of short stories that explore the rich phenomenon of why people ride motorcycles -- is terrific; but the execution is disgusting. Anyone genuinely clueless and curious about why people ride would get a perverse enlightenment from SHE'S A BAD MOTORCYCLE. Just one story from a Hell's Angel perspective would have been plenty. Instead, most of the selections are from motorcycle gang members who are too busy bragging about raping, terrorizing, torturing, and pillaging to bother with good writing. Few ever get around to the subject of what motorcycle riding means to them.  Zanetti also seems to have trouble finding a ride out of California. The other 49 states are severely under represented.  The only reason this book is worth even 2 stars is that it includes a couple token gems that deserve far better company. Entries from Melissa Holbrook Pierson, Robert F. Fulton, and a handful of others aren't enough to make the book worth buying; but they are well worth reading on their own 
   This particular edition of Sun Tzu's "The Art of War" is a bare literal translation prefaced by a rather wordy introduction that pads the book up to a total of 96 pages.  While the translation is not bad, the book contains no explanations or notes to enlighten the readers on some of the more obscure points, such as the modern equivalents of ancient Chinese distance measures.   The one sentence review, pronouncing this to be the best translation, was perhaps a bit generous.  Among both military and history buffs, the prevailing view is that the translation by Lionel Giles, of the British Museum, is the definitive translation.  Of the various available editions of the Giles translation, the Special Edition that contains two complete copies of the English text - one with and one without extensive notes and commentary - in addition to the complete text in Chinese characters - is far and away the best.  The $4.95 price for this book (or for the matchbox size miniature edition from Running Press) is a bargain only for those who are more concerned with price than with value.  Choosing a better edition of "The Art of War", rather than this rather skimpy edition, will be money well spent.  It is far better to own a book you can be proud of and which does a better job of informing you than this merely passable edition.  
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 Very bad, doesn't explain the meaning of the masonry.  Do not waste your time unless your a genius about the masonry, I didn't understand anything about it and he didn't even say what they were 
 I was looking for the Jungle Book 1 by Walt disney's production. As I have Jungle book 2 in my collection, i wanted to purchase Jungle Book 1 to complete the series. Unfortunately, I got the wrong one. What I received is not a Walt Disney's production. Appreciate, if you could help me with what i wanted.  best regards, Ses 
 Although the pack looks OK at first glance, a seam at the top ripped the first time I used it....I'm returning it 
 This book is pure heresy clothed in feel-good, new age sounding terminology. The author blatantly states that he doesn't believe in the basic dogmas of the Christian faith, such as the virgin birth, the physical resurrection, or what he calls the "traditional" redemption and atonement of Jesus Christ. He also does not take the bible at all literally. Granted, there is much spiritual depth to scripture; however, excessive spiritualizing of scripture can lead to this type of "enlightened" Christianity.  His concepts are not Christian, but emphasize the divine nature of mankind while downplaying the role and true divinity of Christ. This is all subtly concealed under the guise of a re-interpretation of the "true" gospel message.  Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of scripture can see the errors in the author's observations and conclusions.   The author has dabbled in mysticism - unfortunately not Christian mysticism as experienced by the myriad of saints of the Roman Catholic Church. This book should in no way serve as a reflection of catholicism for anyone seeking to discover the true Roman Catholic faith. 
 Bought this game on the strength of some reviews here but I was very dissapointed with it. Clunky control system really put me off 
 I hate myself for having read this book right to the end.  It was like reading aspecial double issue of Vanity Fair, packed full of scabrous gossip about a bunch of people I never heard of efore and never will again.  The so-called "celebrities" who flicker through the pages of the book were just flying in, they don't live in Palm Beach, and who's left?  Well, Donald Trump and a few others, all of them deadly dull.  Every page has some kind of cautionary tale about the straight men who rule the roost in Palm Beach and buy their love with money.  This one "can't keep it in his pants."  That one " has to get his affairs into order."  It would be interesting if the reader cared about any of the people, or again, knew who they were.  The author, Kessler, who wrote a fairy tale book about George Bush Jr's Presidential character, is obviously in great anxiety about his own social status, and he must feel that rubbing against these rich, spoiled people on vanity fair's bank account, is going to make him somehow less Jewish.  As many readers have commented, the book is filled with photos of Kessler and his wife ("Pam") meeting rich people, trying to look happy and relaxed.  But their flop sweat is written all over them.  Whoever the photo editor was for THE SEASON should have discreetly taken the Kesslers aside and told them how tacky their photos are, save them for the panelled den in their suburban home, or their cabin cruiser.  Kessler tries to imitate the highly worked novelistic shape of MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD AND EVIL by focussing on the dreary story of a male "walker," a single presentable man who is available to escort society women to parties--this character is called Kirby and he indulges in a passion for a so-called straight man named Bill, a loser ex-con who's always up to some drug-inspired mischief.  Kirby would be pathetic, but at least he shows some emotion.  Unlike the other people Kessler tries to impress us with.  As one woman says in THE SEASON, "There are a lot of floozies and fruits and nuts.  There are also a lot of beautiful men and women here..  But the ones who are straight are taken.  I live in a crazy town.  People try to contaminate me with their bizarreness."  Well, hey, I live in a crazy town too, but I never felt contaminated until I read this impossible, heartbreaking book about trying to mingle with your betters 
 I have a Ph.D studying the Christian right and this is the worst book on Fundamentalism and the Christian Right that I have ever seen.  What is not outright lies are "straw men" arguments meant to make anyone who believes in Christianity look like an idiot.  I feel bad for the people who gave it a good review, they have been duped by the authors who are not arguing a case or explaining the Christian Right, they are feeding propoganda for their own side.  I was given a free copy of this book and after reading it, I threw it in the trash instead of donating it to a library, it is that bad.  Be sure to know something about the author of a book before you buy it, especially on a controversial topics like this one.   
 As an OCD sufferer and someone well-versed on the subject, I know that Levenkron's claim that underparenting causes OCD is absolutely ludicrous. I hope no unsuspecting readers pick this up as their first introduction to the subject and actually believes this. OCD is a biological and chemical brain disorder. While underparenting certainly may cause problems, it doesn't cause OCD. More helpful, suggested authors: Ian Osborn, Jenike, Penze 
 This book just didn't get started for me.  I'm still trying to get interested in it...and for me not to be able to keep a Marcia Muller book in my hands until I'm done is unthinkable. 
 I do not know who the target audience was here, but it certainly was not me, and I am a big Hayek fan. This book is way over my head. Perhaps a doctorate in economics or philosophy would make this work easier to read, but I don't think the average intelligent, interested reader will want to struggle though this material. It never comes up for air. 
 Not only are the lesson plans on this CD-ROM wildly unimaginative, but some of the answers on at least one pre-made test are actively wrong, as are some of the ways the questions are worded (e.g. character names are confused).  I have students who performed better on this test than the designer did.  I had go back and completely recalibrate the score, when designing something from scratch would've spent the same amount of time and saved me the cash 
 Sorry to disagree with the enthusiastic publishers and some readers, but I found Fox Evil an utter bore, with little action, long-winded conversation that doesn't move the story forward, and characters for whom I felt little interest. Walters also knows little about police investigative techniques, judging by the interviews that various officers conduct. Sadly, I've been unable to complete Walters last two books, also boring and with unsympathetic characters. She has been a disappointment for me, for I really enjoyed her earlier works, The Ice House, The Scupltress, and the Scold's Bridle. I also find her injection of news items, letters, police reports, etc., as shortcuts to explalining certain plot action. Either describe it succinctly as possible or let the characters do it. I'm not holding my breath for Walters nexr opus 
 What makes a great novel? A combination of factors, no doubt. Complex characters, a central conflict that develops into a grand theme. Great command of language and imagery. If by these standards, Lord Jim is a great novel, then why is it so revolting? Why do I hate this book more than any other that I've read? It's even worse than the pathetic Madame Bovary, which was on top of my list of the worst books ever written. It's because it has no sense of story. This is the one other factor that makes a great novel, and this is the one that sets apart the "Conrads" from the "Dickenses" of the world. Conrad has the ability to take a moment in time and stretch it out into what seems like a day, and to me, this tedious, hair-splitting approach to interpretation of feelings, motives and gestures clogs the story hopelessly and destroys any sense of timing and pacing. And what after all is reading all about? You can condense the moral truths in a book into a paragraph and save a lot of time, but what makes any book enjoyable is a well told story. This one is not 
 Here is yet another published response to "Da Vinci Code" which ignores the one exciting idea in the book- the presumption that women, and possibly even relations between women and men, are just as bloomin' divine as single men are.  No wonder that this movie is stirring up animosity in the Church which has consistently sponsored violence toward and mistrust of the feminine. I have yet to see this idea addressed by the Church or the professional "de-bunkers." It would seem that it's much easier to just jump on historical inaccuracies and literary devices and loudly demonstrate how disrespectful they are- that since the author wrote a work of fiction with one stirring idea, that by smearing all the rest of the work the idea will be forgotten. Good try. *sound of weak clapping 
 This small book has a load of recommendations on the back cover. Yet, I find it unsatisfactory. It meanders in and out of the history of Islam and the Middle East, but loses focus on the way. Subjects are touch upon by conclusion and generalisation, but not really in depth. It is obvious, however, that Lewis knows quite a lot - but still some clear mistakes (or misformulations?) in chronology and factual events mar the picture, and damages the feeling of trust to how the subjects are handled. It has some really interesting insights in how the USA became the great enemy of the Islamists, and many details that makes the Middle East history much more detailed than it usually appears. Yet, in walking there and there, it lacks the solid foundation on facts and events present in the books of Serge Trifkovic, for example. And while Trifkovic writes with determination and feeling for the importance of facing the Islamist threat, Lewis merely mentions the threat, but then walks on to something else. And he doesn't really connect the issues of Holy War and Unholy Terror in depth as promised in the subtitle.  Bottom line: While interesting, I suggest to spend time and money on better books. They are out there 
 Would have given "0" stars on this one.  Boring and lacks any direction 
 How many pages should a writer fill to explain that a character is afraid of forks, knives and mirrors?  Two?  Well Koontz takes over a hundred, and repeats, repeats, repeats.  500 pages should have been cut from this book.  Repetition weakens writing 
 One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific  facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible "theories". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.. 
 OKAY, FOR STARTERS, I DID LOOK AT THE VARIOUS OTHER REVIEWS AND THOUGHT I WOULD TAKE MY CHANCE. IT SEEMED THE GOOD OUTWEIGHED THE BAD. UNTIL...I BOUGHT IT AND AM TRYING TO INSTALL IT (AS WE SPEAK BUT GOT IRRITATED SO AM TAKING A BREAK TO WRITE THIS.) WHERE TO BEGIN, THE LOCKING MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE FINE IF YOU CAN GET IT TO INSTALL IN THE FIRST PLACE. HOWEVER, THE MANUFACTER ONLY INCLUDES SCREWS FOR WOOD WALLS. WHICH MEAN, IF YOU DONT HAVE WOOD WALLS YOU HAVE TO GO BUY OTHER SCREWS! I HAVE DRYWALL AND THE SCREWS ARE NOT RELIABLE. SECOND, I BOUGHT THIS GATE WITH THE EXTENSION (24", THE ONLY ONE THERE IS) BECAUSE THE TOP OF MY STAIRS MEASURE 44 1/2 INCHES. THIS GATE IS SUPPOSED TO FIT THAT WITH THE EXTENSION. IT DOESNT. I HAVE TRIED FOR OVER AN HOUR TO GET IT TO FIT AND IT DOESNT FIT EVEN WITH THE EXTENSION. IT WOULD WITHOUT THE EXTENSION HOWEVER THERE IS ABOUT A 5 INCH GAP FROM THE WALL TO THE BOLTS ON EACH SIDE AND THAT IS WITH THE BOLTS ALL THE WAY UNSCREWED ALSO. NEEDLESS TO SAY IF I WANT THIS GATE TO WORK, I HAVE TO GO TO MY LOCAL HARDWARE STORE AND BUY NEW HARDWARE SO THIS WILL MOUNT SECURLY OR I HAVE TO TAKE IT BACK TO THE STORE AND FIND SOMETHING ELSE. UNLESS I CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO MAKE IT FIT HOW IT IS, THIS GATE HAS BEEN A WASTE OF MY TIME AND MY MONEY. THE ONLY REASON I GAVE IT 2 STARS IS BECAUSE IM SURE IT WOULD BE JUST FINE IF I HAD WOOD WALLS AND IT FIT TO WHERE I CAN INSTALL IT. NOW I HAVE HOLES IN MY WALL AND CONFUSSION TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT FIT IF ITS AT ALL POSSIBLE. DOESNT LOOK LIKE IT IS THOUGH. 
 Alas, it is no satire.  If it were satire, Our Heroine would not be right Every Single Time (even when she's being stupid), and the author would be sniggering at her instead of with her.  It's amazing how well she can bend other people to her will with only a single speech, or a single flash of her nipples.    It's also amazing how often Our Heroine is both average and extraordinary.  She's a mid-level bureaucrat AND the Emperor's ex-wife.  Everyone who's anyone is beautiful AND she's gorgeous even by those standards.    What we have here is not satire but Mary Sue.  And a badly written one at that 
 I don't know why this book is a classic.  Foreigners come to Babar's home and kill his mother.  He goes to the land of the foreigners to learn to be just like them because the are so swell and all.  He then takes their ways back home with him.  marries his cousin and gets everyone to wear clothes like the foreigners.  This is a nightmare, not a children's book 
 I felt it was very scientific and difficult reading.  I wasn't able to get past 20 minutes with this book although I am sure by the title it has great information in it.  I don't feel it's for the average person more medical / scentific minds.   Truthfully, I feel my money was wasted and wish I would of took the time to return it.   
 I read Kathryn Davis' book The Thin Place and fell in love with her writing style, wanting more of her work. When I received Labrador in hardback, I could not wait to dive back into her writing style. As much as I enjoy the so-called "intellectual fiction", this novel was too much of that style. I tried to read at least the first 50 pages but felt myself drowning in her too in-depth work. I know that this was her first novel, so I am willing to overlook it and read her other work. However, I was deeply disappointed in this novel. I still think she is one hell of a writer and as stated before, I will be reading her other works very soon 
 I am sure it is a great cable but it does not work for Apple computers. Samsung does not have a driver that supports the cable and a mac. The company I ordered the cable from is great, easy to work with, but once again it does not work on a mac. Bummer. I have repeated that it does not work on a mac multiple times because I want to make it very clear that it doesnt work with a mac. I blame Samsung 
 I am a big fan of Lee Smith. No author today is capable of bringing the southern family to life the way she does and she does it again in Family Linen. The only problem is that she hangs them out to dry too long. There are all these wonderful characters, each with their own distinct voice and unique story to tell but then nothing really happens. She tries to cover it up by saying small town gossip gets forgotten as soon as there's something new to talk about but it shouldn't work that way in a book. When you've invested a couple of hundred pages in something there should be some kind of payoff. Definitely not her best effort 
 Although the spark of creativity is there, it still takes some time to appreciated this novel after reading Janes Eyre.  The main character Crimsworth seems to be arrogance, aristocratic, and audacious.  This could be Bronte's first take on a male perspective, but is that what she considered the male psyche to be as she portrays on her other novels' male characters.  All in all the novel has some worth, but needs getting used to 
 This is a very bizarre movie.  Some Ape creature becomes friends with Vanity on an island where only she and her lover are.  Her lover becomes jealous and then later the Ape creature and he battle over Vanity.  Appears to be a dream.  Vanity is cute and nude in the movie, but she hardly looks like herself.  Very odd movie, if you are looking for Vanity nude, you are better off getting a copy of 52 pickup a better movie or Action Jackson.  She shows skin in both.  Here she does have a full frontal scene, but it is not all that long anyway 
 only the Khazar elite converted to the Jewish faith there are plenty of archeological expeditions that have uncovered burials from the same period that are monotheistic in origin. the experts of Molecular Population Genetics would also have something to say on the matter. 
 First off...be aware.  Even though it isn't stated anywhere explicitly on the page, this item is PAN & SCAN.  That's what an aspect ratio of 1.33/1 means.  I missed that.  Second, the print is total crap.  It's completely grainy, and it looks like it was transferred from VHS.  Stay away and look for another version of this DVD 
 To me, this book seems to have been written from a great distance. When are caucasian writers going to stop calling themselves "bold" and "daring" when they "lift the curtain" on Chinatown?  Stop all the self-congratulation. This is a book written from the point of  view of an OUTSIDER, which is okay, but let's call it what it is. Read  "The New Chinatown" by Peter Kwong or "Born to Kill" by  T.J. English, both books about the Asian community written with compassion  and understanding 
 Needless to say, this set is missing some of my favorite unsolved murders from the show.  But I found that a lot of those that were included were ones I'd never seen, and there are only a couple segments that I personally don't think should have been included.  The last segment of the set, for example- the one entitled "Campus Calamity"- hardly seems to even rate as a local news item.  It just seems like a segment for a dreadfully slow week at Unsolved Mysteries.  However, the reason I can't strongly recommend this set to anyone but fans is the puzzling poor quality of the picure in many segments.  The most egregious example of this is for one of the most interesting segments, "Friends to the End".  The picture grain is simply atrocious in it's entirety.  I can't understand why the transfer for a dvd of such a recent, highly regarded show wouldn't be utterly pristine.  They can't say they didn't have good source material, right?  Most segments have some incidence of grain and blurring.  Sometimes the picture is about as clear as you would expect.  I've read that the other sets have a similar problem.  But, if that's not wholly important to you...  Some comments on the various segments:  Trailer Terror- Just one of the stories in the set that deals with an apparent police conspiracy and/or police incompetence.  Quite shocking.  Journalists Murder-  This very interesting spot on the apparently staged suicide of journalist Danny Casolaro really gives the set some needed integrity.  This is a well known story to conspiracy buffs.  Backyard Bones- One of the weirder cases; yet in the commentary it's revealed that this one is a little less of a mystery than previously supposed, though far from cut-and-dried.  World Leaders- This one probably doesn't belong here, but most will find it fairly interesting.  Burned Evidence- Another case in which the police are suspect, though not suspected alone.  Appalling.  Plane Crash Sabotage- This one seems a little misplaced; yet there is no denying it's a mystery.  Bordello Murders- One in which in which it can reasonably be assumed that a police officer perpetrated the crime.  Not that he'll ever be brought to justice...  Dakota's Double Death- One of the weirdest murder mysteries I've seen.  You could write a speculative horror story about it.  Zodiac/Unabomber- Did you know there were parallels between these two murderous figures?  Probably the neatest segment.  Two other things that disappoint me: Some of the best segments don't get a commentary (only 1 of 4 do).  Also: Why are there any *solved* mysteries on the disc at all?  That seems like kind of a waste.  Surely, the UFO & ghost sets don't have any "solved" mysteries.  If they put all the solved mysteries on one set, do you think anyone would buy it?  Frankly, I'd just recommend watching the reruns if you want to see these segments, as well as all of the ones that are notably absent.  Send a message to First Look (the company responsible for the sets) that we want a better product than this.  What's the point of buying a dvd that doesn't look as good as the show does on cable itself 
 I also own both the salt ball and the pepper ball and have to disagree with the previous reviewer; I find both useful at the table but very unhelpful when cooking. The balls are both great when seasoning food, but do not work at all for recipes that require exact amounts. The opening at the bottom of the ball is extremely large, and attempting to direct what is coming out into a teaspoon or tablespoon is worthless- you'll use up all of the pepper before for you get whatever measurement you need.  Additionally, mine (ordered from amazon.com) did not come with the stand the product claims to have. Therefore, when the ball is sitting on the counter, it is very susceptible to picking up things around it- any sort of spilt liquid will go up into the ball (especially the salt one) and ruin whatever is inside. I also do agree that both balls produce very inconsistent salt and pepper- even whole pepper balls will come through mine. Also, the amount of pepper inside at the beginning is very limited (mine was only 1/4 full when I got it). However, if you are able to keep them dry and don't mind refills, these balls will give you freshly ground salt and pepper, are easy to use, and can make a cute addition to the table.   I do believe both are overpriced for what they can do, as you will wind up paying $30 for the set. You might want to consider either paying an extra $10 for a more durable and effective set or sticking with the cheaper, non-mill varieties. 
 This author has gotten one thing right: scientific discoveries and theories should be questioned.  In fact, any scientist who says otherwise is rather disingenuous.  Science is all about questioning pre-existing knowledge.  That's how it grows and, with observation, experimentation and logical reasoning, is part of how new knowledge is acquired.  That's what Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein and anyone else who has made scientific discoveries did.  There is a point however where the questioning continuously leads to the same conclusion, which is the point where concepts such as evolution and relativity are now.  Where creationists/intelligent designers fail is in assuming that simply raising questions provides evidence to the contrary of what you are questioning.  It does not. If there is an "intelligent designer" you need to do more than simply point out that there are aspects of evolutionary biology where further research is needed.  What you have to do is provide research that provides evidence for any alternative that you propose. Simply raising questions is not enough.  You need to provide evidence for an alternative claim. Without such evidence, creationism cannot be considered science, and thus, has no place in a science classroom.  Furthermore, you must be willing to subject yourself to - and to encourage - the same process of questioning of your ideas. I am a Christian who has no problem with this. I don't need to lie to children to keep my faith strong. I don't need to confuse them about what constitutes scientific knowledge. I can accept that evolution is the way God created the world.  Why He has chosen to do it that way is for Him to know.  I don't trust anyone who says they know what God thinks.  I don't trust anyone, such as this author, who feels he has to mislead people about scientific knowledge in order to have faith in God.  
 When I opened the product, the sheets really were soft. But when you're laying on them, they aren't very comfortable.  I wouldn't buy another set again. But they were cheap, so not a horrible buy 
 A fan of the Notebook, I was dissapointed to see that Sparks has hit cruise control. There we no surprises here, and the depth of the characters could be measured in centimeters - especially the doctor, who is very one dimentional. I think it wouldn't have taken him that much more time to flush out the story, but, well, he didn't.  It doesn't mean I won't keep reading him, I just hope that he gets  his bearings back. So far, the Notebook is still my favorite 
 Great Expectations was a mediocre book.  I was not impressed.  I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class.  It was too long and boring.  I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real.  It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill.  Every chapter was boring.  I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book.  Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays?  This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story.  In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens.  STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!  If you want to read a good Dickens story, read "A Christmas Carol" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens 
 I was very disappointed in this book.  I, guess, as a musician I was hoping for more emphasis on music and not twelve pages on bathing, showering, shaving, putting on underwear...well, you get the idea.  It's the first Reading Rainbow book I have not liked at all.  I had planned to give this to a friend's children but I defintely will not 
 If you have Kids or Grandkids, who think about politics & like "SF"; give them this book!  It was One of the many Heinlein Works that helped ME grow up.  It is the BEST & MOST IMPORTANT of his "for KIDS novels".  I ment to give it 5 Stars!!!! 
 This was a major disappointment.  I am a great fan of any "Vatican"  novel and will read some mediocre stuff to get my fix.  This, however, did not reach that standard!  It is the first novel I have been tempted to give up when only half-way through.  As for the suggestion that a bunch of feminist-minded nuns are trying to change the church, this compliments the book too much.  There is a dream story that keeps appearing throughout the story but adds nothing.  Page after page of some medieval drivel.  Comparisons to Morris West  -  kidding?  You might say I didn't like this one 
 I completely agree with the reviewer "Scott McKay". We've reduced our youth to obessive, fashion freaks and teen losers. By today's standards, being a "fashion god", a "hottie" and a brat are cool. These books show how immature some of our writers are today.         Have some sort of value and when your daughter comes home from the bookstore with a bagfull of "The CLique" books, light up your grill and make her watch you burn those books to ashes. And when she asks for the money back, just say "No".               As Green Day would say, we've become "one nation controlled by the media" 
 I'll preface this by saying I'm a cryer.  I cry at movie previews when they simply look entertaining.  I cried all the way through Superman Returns.  I did not, however, shed one tear during Message in a Bottle.  In English class, I always learned to "show, not tell" when writing.  When that is your rule of thumb, you'll write a moving piece of literature, even if you're not completely skillful.  Sparks is the master of telling without showing.  I'm honestly baffled by all the good reviews it gets.  The story is somewhat engaging, but with no payoff.  But the work is filled with passages like (and these are from memory; if I picked up the book to look for verbatim examples I'd have to type the entire thing), "He went to the refrigerator, opened the door, and took a beer.  After opening it, he sat down on the back deck."  Or, "Though she was overweight, she moved quickly around the table."  "She got out of the shower, dried off, and put on khaki shorts and a white cotton shirt."  Have you read enough yet?  I'm new to the romance genre.  My mother-in-law recommended Sparks because -- I think she was trying to imply -- his sex scenes aren't too graphic.  They were to me, but then, I'm new to romance, and spoiled by the masterful, unequaled storytelling skill of Stephen King.  Please hold your New York Times bestsellers to a higher standard.  Let's hold on to whatever quality control we can in music, movies, and literature 
 Having baked steadily for 30 years, I am exceptionally disappointed in this book. I have yet to have any recipe turn out despite following the directions and living at normal altitude 
 I am returning to China next week and was looking forward to buying some tea.  Last time I was there buying tea was very difficult because of the language problem (I don't speak or read Chinese).  Even the very nice tea shop staff who speak English don't know how to name tea varieties in English.  They carefully wrote the name of the teas I bought in Chinese on each tin, but that doesn't do me much good.  I was hoping this book would have the names of all the "50 famous teas" in Chinese and English so I could point in the book to the one I wanted (the way you do it to get the cab driver to take you where you want to go).  However, all it has is the Chinese name spelled phonetically in English characters.  Useless in China 
 This book is NOT Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates as listed.  It is Cram101 Textbook Review to accompany a textbook.  This is very false advertising and Amazon should correct the listing so that further people are not misled.  
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 for those of you out there that are dumb enough to think rachael ray has a "new york" accent you are sadly mistaken. as a true new yorker rachael ray has more of a chicago accent then a "new york" one. you've got to be totally foolish to think she has a new york accent. the loud,obnioxious food network host has unleashed her verison of what she thinks guy's eat. however it's far from what guy's actually eat. infact no guy i ever talked to would have ever touched the recipes in this book.  i mean come on now hots dogs on a hamburger???? she must want a heart attack! this book doesn't even have anything in it that a guy would eat no guy's i've ever hanged out with would eat what's inside this book. rachael tries her hardest to convince others she's a tomboy however it always fails cause she knows nothing about guys.  skip this book. 
 This book is in the "never wear white after Labor Day" school of design: it lists tired old rules that *never* should be broken. For example: always paint the ceiling white, use only one pattern in a room, only use white floors and white tiles in the bathroom (and no colorful shower curtain, either). I could give more examples, but the pattern is clear. In addition, her advice for families with children is absurd.  As the mother of two toddlers, I did know whether to laugh or cry at her assertion that it isn't necessary to box up breakables when you have small children. What to do?  Just put breakables up high, on a piano or a tall bookshelf. I have yet to see the toddler who couldn't scale either one in under a minute. I gave it two stars because it would be useful for people who want an attractive home and have no clue how to do it on their own. I suspect they would end up with something that had as much personality as a hotel room, but if you don't enjoy decorating, that might be considered a Good Thing.  One final thought: look at the picture on the cover. She violates her own advice several times. Why 
 I also was really looking forward to reading this book but had to force myself to finish.  As a redhead, I feel armed with some more knowledge about the history of redheads but was left... hanging, somehow. I found it disjointed and it was not an enjoyable read 
 I somehow listened to the whole CD and I just wasn't impressed. It didn't surprise me that the only decent songs were I'm Sprung, the Remix, and I'm N Luv Wit A Stripper. "Studio Luv" could be a possible single in my opinion. One of the best songs he has done isn't even on the CD and that's "Ask For It" feat. Nivea. Basically, he needs to stick to being "featured" in songs, because he can't hold his own. Too bad 
 Fresh in my grief, I found this a hard book to read. It has a lot of text book information and probably is very helpful later in grief. But, it reads like a text book and I found it hard to process when my grief was so fresh 
 I was very upset by this book. I stopped reading  it after three chapters. Norman Mailer is a deeply disturbed, dirty old man. The book had less to do with Hitler than with Mailer's bizarre imagination. While no one would dispute the fact that Hitler was a horrible man, Mr. Mailer mind seems to dwell in a sick and twisted world. This book does nothing to enlighten us. It is demeaning to the human spirit. I benefited not at all and felt that if I had continued reading I would be "dirtied". 
 I love the Redsox and have since I can remember, but I had trouble finishing this book.  So we get a diary from the perspective of two diehard fans.  All this does is remind me of what I was thinking during the season before/during/after certain games, but it never provided me with an interesting tidbits.  As for the perspective of a true "diehard" fan, O'Nan acts like an imbecile.  I can imagine him out at the game forcing his way past kids to get balls during batting practice.  Wow, that sure is fun to read about!!!!  And his obsession with his fishing net is scary as well.  He comes across as a whiny kid in an adult body that has fun bragging that he had an "in" during the season.  He provided nothing to the enjoyment of this book.  King was better, and because his mind seems to work differently than the average person, it was fun to see his perspective on certain events.  Some of his passages are the only reason that I gave this book two stars instead of one.  I would suggest that if you followed the season closely either through reading the Globe or Herald, or listened to Boston sports radio, you will get nothing out of this book.  If on the other hand you were caught up in the euphoria of the postseason and want to know some of the feelings Redsox fans went through during the season, you might enjoy some of the book.  Now can I direct my book royalties so that O'Nan doesn't get anything 
 After the many glowing reviews of this book, I was ready to love it.  But I just couldn't.  What really bothered me was I felt Daniel made totally unrealistic advances in a short period of time.  In real life, language acquisition in non-verbal autistic kids is a slow process.  My son was diagnosed over 5 years ago, and I still remember the pain the diagnosis brought, so I could relate to Melanie.  The disorder is not as easily improved as is shown here. 
 Don't bother buying this one.  The author has a serious case of the "I's" and is more interested in herself than in the subjects she is researching.  Even more unforgiving, I felt I had read a book that did nothing more than recycle old information and put it in a new suit 
 Hersh obviously doesn't like the present administration. He obviously has a beef with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld. "Chain of Command" is a political rant with a lot of claims, but not much support. He rarely supports his claims with facts, and his arguments are clearly not-logical. He begins his book by claiming that the Interogations at Guantanamo have had no results, that the intelligence wasn't satisfying the needs of the Pentagon. This obviously isn't taking the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed into account. He pushes forth the idea that the "Failing to Gain Intelligence" from Guantanamo, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld decided to solve the problem by spreading the practice of abuse to Iraq. That is illogical.  By simply doing your own resarch you will find that this, and many other claims made by Hersh in this novel are exaggerated, falsified, misquoted, misinterpreted, etc. This book is libel against the soldiers who have fought or are fighting in the War on Terror. Anyone who ever took a prisoner is touched by this calumny.  I'd also like to say one more thing about the scale of the abuses: There were 66 allegations out of 300 that were substantiated. These substantiated allegations have been or are in the process of being investigated and prosecuted. Those numbers represent such a small fraction of the people who have fought  and are fighting this war, it is tempting to say it is negligible. But it's not. It's a redundant proof that our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen are not war criminals. With very few exceptions these young people are true to American values even in the worst and most dangerous circumstances.  Hersh is part of the Blame America first crowd. This book is proof of that. It is nothing but an unsubstantiated, unsupported conspiracy theory intended to smear the present administration. 
 This movie is no "Heathers."  It's not even "Mean Girls."  As hard as it tried to be witty, shocking, dark, and satirical, it just made me want to bang my head against a wall to make the pain of watching it stop.  Maybe I'm just too old for this drivel -- although I could watch "Clueless" and "The Craft" until my DVD player breaks -- but whatever entertainment value this movie was trying to push, I just didn't get it.  The movie wasn't funny (which is sad to say when one of my favorite comedic actresses, Carol Kane, couldn't even elicit a smile out of me), the plot was full of holes, and the writing seemed very rushed and contrived.  I wasn't expecting greatness when I watched Jawbreakers, but I was at least hoping for 1 1/2 hours of mindless entertainment.  Unfortunately, the "entertainment" piece was dropped and I was just left with "mindless. 
 This book should be titled 'What Every Woman Should Know about Custody Battles'. I found absolutely nothing helpful about a basic childless divorce in this book. If you are going through a divorce and have custody issues, this might be okay for you. If you have no children, don't even bother 
 I can understand that certain students may want to get ahold of some basic concepts (especially if they are not up to speed yet on their higher level math skills) but this book does not make things all that clear.  Sure the concepts themselves aren't all that difficult to grasp but the way in which the information is presented is sometimes confusing and distracting.  There is a lot of useless information in this book, such as the authors random remarks on loving other cultures among other things.  What place off topic subjexts such as those have in a physics book is beyond me.  Take out the useless or obscure information and the book would probably be only 2/3 of it's current length.  That extra space could be used to introduce the reader to more formulas and teach the reader how to set up problems.  That would probably serve them better and give them more preparation for future physics courses 
 In one of what appears to be Carole Radizwill's not-so-subtle jabs at her mother-in-law (and at many of the extended family), she implies Lee wondered what exactly her son saw in Carole ... something along the lines of "how much do they have in common beides ABC?"  After finishing this book, I have to say I have no idea what, if anything, they did have in common, nor, more importantly, what it was that first caused them to fall in love.  While I can understand and appreciate the author's reservations about revealing too much of their personal relationship, I think she fails to convey why they even had any relationship in the first place.  As has been commented on by many reveiwers, she sounds much more passionate when she writes of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy (again, not in a lesbian way, but in an idealized school-girl crush way).  I found myself wondering if they really were as close as Carole portrays, or if this book is a rather sad attempt to publicly attach herself to Carolyn forever.  
 My husband and I are both college educated and can't figure this game out for the life of us.  Not only are the directions confusing but the game itself is cheap and flimsy. The only time we play it (which is very rare) is when we "make up" our own rules.  Please don't waste your money 
 The material quickly goes astray claiming that "the primary path to greatness in the social sectors is not to be become more like a business."  Collins manages that conclusion through a non-sequitor - stating that basics such as personnel selection, demanding results, etc. don't count "because poor companies don't do those either."  Regardless, while Collins does identify the NYPD as an example of a well-run social-sector organization, his coverage is less than superficial.  Similarly, while Collins admits that social sectors often have a problem getting rid of unsatisfactory performers, he doesn't seem to appreciate how important that is.  American public education and healthcare are the two biggest social sectors, and both perform poorly while costing more/client than that of any other nation.  Public education costs have escalated far faster than the CPI in general (while pupil achievement and dropout rates have stagnated), and healthcare costs rise faster than most anything else - despite repeated evidence that basic treatment steps are frequently omitted or performed poorly, millions lack healthcare access, and Americans' outcomes lag those of a number of nations.    Part of the problem is that both sectors are heavily funded by third-parties (thus appearing "free" to users); another is the lack of good outcome measures; a third is that neither sector strongly links provider success with pupil/patient outcomes - in fact, both sectors generally achieve more income the worse their clients' outcomes.  My "Bottom-Line:"  The two largest American social sector components need enormous improvement; this is best accomplished through providing incentives for them to act more like businesses - Collins' point of view notwithstanding 
 If you like this book you will probably like "Bless the Child" by Cathy Cash Spellman.  They are very similar.  This book can be summed up in one word, simple: simple-minded, simple characters, simple plot (applied loosely), and simple premise.  What a contrived piece of garbage!  I can't describe everything wrong with this book because there's not enough time.  If it's meant to be a mystery it sucks because you figure out who did it about halfway through.  If it's meant to empower women it sucks because the women are either victims, in denial, weak, worried about what everyone thinks, or oblivious.  If it's meant to promote animal adoptions it sucks because the author's plea for that is irritating.  That's how bad this book is! It can make an animal lover say that its plea for more animal adoptions was annoying.  This author has no style.  The book reads like an episode of inside edition.  There is no immersion into the story.  The total lack of character development leaves you with no compassion for them.  As a reader I felt completely outside the story; an uncaring observer of a poorly described scenario.  The attempts to tug at my heartstrings were laughable.  I've been more moved by the appearance of colorful weeds on my lawn.  The only reason I read the whole thing was that my neighbor recommended it and loaned it to me.  Do not waste your time.    I must say though that this novel was inspirational.  If this crap can make the best seller list, it gives me hope that my original fiction might get published 
 I do not recommend this book unless you are more interested in a technical history rather than a layman's history.  It may make a good textbook, but it is not exciting to read 
 At 300mm this lens is VERY soft, it's hard to get a shot that looks like it's in focus.  To do so, you need to shoot at about f/11, and then since there is little light available, you usually have to bump the ISO to 800 or 1600 just to get an acceptable shutter speed. Of course, the high ISO then introduces other artifacts.  The focus is also dead slow and often doesn't lock on.  This is a lens that I have constantly fought with.  Don't upgrade to the new 70-300 IS either, as it's only marginally better.  Buy the 70-200 f/4L.  It's a far superior lens 
 This book is an OK introduction to the area real estate investment, but there are very little helpful specifics.  There are, as other reviews have noted, a lot of sales pitches for Mr. Hicks' other packages and business ventures.  Also, he is a huge proponent of getting in debt as much as possible and with poor terms and interest rates, which is a controversial way to go about things IMO.  There has to be better books out there.  Glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't buy it 
 I bought this book for my son who has never had a lesson but has been self teaching himself for a few years. The things I was disappointed about 1) the singing is so HORRIBLE it is almost impossible to watch.  My son became frustrated with this alone and never wanted to continue...His exact words, "This is LAME."  He wouldn't use it, so I decided to try to learn guitar to keep from wasting my money.  2) The descriptions on the cover are misleading and lead you to believe there is much more advanced instruction than is actually in it...there is little about much of it and then it is not what the instructor leads you to believe it is...for example the jazz chords are not actually what you expect to learn.  3) The instructor uses different fingering techniques than he instructs you to use, so learning it is very hard...part of the advantage of buying a dvd is WATCHING the instructor...which is totally useless if he is doing something different than he instructs you to do.  Also it is hard to keep up with him as his fingering techniques allow him to change chords much more quickly and you are struggling to keep up.  Being frustrated when you are trying to learn is NOT a good way to stay motivated.  My son had to tell me it wasn't me it was the instructor. 4) my son knew ALL of the material in this DVD although he has never had a lesson.  I would recommend this for a very early beginner who had no clue about chords or guitars at all.  Otherwise, SAVE YOUR MONEY.  I did learn a little. I am a complete idiot about guitars but knew a good bit of what was presented just from guitars being in my home.  This is the most elementary information you can imagine 
 These recipes may be simple, but they are not ingredients that one would find at the local grocery store. I purchaced this cook book because I thought that it would be simple and "every-day" user friendly;not so simple.  
 As a Bob Dylan aficiondo, I decided to add this one to the home library...Big Mistake. The quality of the photos are substandard and appear to be taken by an amature photographer. Also, I agree with the previous review regarding the irrelevant text that drifts aimlessly throughtout the entire book, complete waste of time. Marsh & Gilbert's attempt to unload mediocre material is very clear to any true enthusiast. Save yourself the money and disappointment.   
 I paid for the movie and never received it nor did I get my money back from Amazon.co 
 I love the Office.  What I don't love is Amazon listing a 3-disc boxed set of Seasons 1 and 2 and the 2 BBC specials for sale and then mailing me 2 separate discs of Seasons 1 and 2.  So be aware that Amazon is not shipping what they advertise here.  I have contacted them and have had not a reply about this 
 I bought this book immediately after we found out I was pregnant and was really expecting it to be "the guide" to pregnancy.  Basically, it gives pretty accurate and complete information, but every time I pick it up, I am quite turned off by the condescending tone (i.e. if you eat a slice of white bread with butter, vs. whole grain with nothing, you are probably not fit to be a mother sort of notion).  This book doesn't even make me feel guilty...just irritated that an authority on the subject could be so demeaning.  As a first time mom, I would advise you NOT to get this book.  I know I am not alone either because every time I see used pregnancy books for sale or for free, it is among them.  Many of my pregnant friends have gotten rid of this book for the same reason.  In terms of getting good info, the internet is great and of course there are many many pregnancy books out there.  It is really unfortunate that this is considered to be "THE" pregnancy book, when it is such a disappointing read.  If you insist on buying this book, check a garage sale or Goodwill.  There you will probaly find an abundance of rejects.  
 I am sorry, but I do not share the rosy opinion of the particular book left by the other reviewers.  Lutzer pretends to offer an objectives survey of the doctrines he discusses, but in actuality he merely argues for his own biases.  His arguments for Calvinism are particularly weak.  There are many fine surveys of Christian doctrine for one to choose from; this is not one of them 
 My boss asked me to get this, so that he check out the Latin portion of it.  What a waste!  The only Latin on this CD is *Latin* American Spanish.  The interface was underwhelming. I needed to guess at what did what, because the controls are mostly icons. What's worse, there is no  menu bar at the top to help take the guess work out of using the program.   Apparently though, the manufacturer did throw in an extra *not* listed on the back.  If you are learning the differences between US and UK English, its there!  I gave this one star, only because I couldn't give it no stars 
 The West Wing is my favorite television show of all time.  Period.  Nothing else comes even close.  I could go on and on about the show, but others are doing an excellent job on that score, and that's not my point here.  My point is the awful, awful DVD.  No English-language subtitles (for the second year in a row).  Only two special features, both about the debate episode.  No insight from the actors about their take on seven years of ground-breaking television.  No tribute to John Spencer.  I feel as if the folks at Warner Brothers Television knew they had their market well in hand, so the quality of the product really didn't matter.  "No bother, we'll sell enough anyway."  I'm one of those that bought it anyway, but I feel as if I got ripped off.  
 Well, someone "kindly" included this book with another I had purchased off of Amazon as a "gift"....and I wish I had never ever read it. If I could give it negative stars I would. I actually read it maybe a year and a half ago and it still nauseates me. The rape, the adultery, I would have jumped off the bridge myelf and taken my unborn child with me. Ugh! I could MAYBE have gotten over the adultery, I mean he WAS ordered to do it after all....but the rape?? Forget it. No way no how. I wish I had never read this book, it honestly makes me want to cry (and not in a good way! 
 Patty really wants to settle down, get married, have a baby, and get that house with a white picket fence. She is in love with her best friend and former fiance, unfortunately, several years ago, Ethan broke their engagement because he's gay. Ethan even sets up Patty on a couple of blind dates, one of which is probably a good match for her, but since Ethan is in her heart, she has no room for anyone else, and he manages to marry her best friend.  Patty, not wanting to accept life without Ethan, proposes that they instead have a baby since neither is in a serious relationship and both want to be parents. Ethan surprisingly goes along with it in a moment of despair, and Patty is bummed to discover that a single encounter results in a pregnancy (she wanted more practice).  I really was disappointed with the storyline. I found Patty's character to be really sad and lonely and so willing to settle by wallowing in self pity. The ending only proves how sad and lonely Patty is destined to remain, particularly with her best friend so happily married and pregnant herself 
 Another sax player who had as his sole influence guys like Kenny G.  This is just plain poor music by any standard.  There is no substance here 
 This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though. 
 I love the Scarpetta books, but I had to force myself to finish this one.  The plot was disjointed, and the use of the English language was atrocious.  I can't believe she published this.  It is absolutely not up to par.  If you're going to waste your time on this book, get it from a library so you don't waste your money as well 
 I have seen 3 other Cirque's, Mystere (fantastic), O (great) and the one in Orlando (Okay). This one was a total disappointment. It was all about smoke, grunts, lights and the stage. In fact, the stage was the star of the show.  There were NO breathtaking acts like the other shows. The music was canned, not live. The only "performances" were a baton twirler (very lame .. better ones at high school football games), two guys who ran on the outsides of two rotating wire cages (okay but not really Wow!), and an aerial act that was so so.  At $150 per ticket I feel totally ripped off 
 This book goes nowhere, and is of extremely small size. The images are all tired old fetish pictures you would expect to see as cutting edge fashion in a Sunday Magazine rather than anything in a scene publication. It just covers the tired old fetish standards, rubber, leather, feet, that sort of thing, each with a single photo and an inane paragraph of text 
 Like many people have repeatedly said, Bigger Faster is not a good album. 4 Non-Blondes are the epitome of a one-hit wonder band. Anyone thinking about purchasing this album needs to seriously rethink what they want to do, because the only song they'll want is "What's Up". Even that one song on repeat listens is going to get old after more than one listen. And then it starts to latch onto your brain stem and slowly kill any function your brain was capable of. It's really a dreadful song in retrospect. Linda Perry (doesn't she look like a post-op Perry Farrell?) undulates like a dying cat when she wails "Hey yay yay Yay yay yay Yaerggggghhhhh-- What's going on". It's simply grotesque. I remember that several bands in the early 90's tried their hand at this quasi Folk/Grunge conglomeration, and results were disastrous. Another one of these acts in question was Blind Melon. Sure, everyone (myself included) loved "No Rain", but if you bought the full-length album, you'd wished you hadn't 
 This season of Angel is beautifully written. It's exciting and it's got a lot of hairpin curves. The problem is the "Ick Factor." The "Ick Factor" shows up in every character. It gets so intense that it takes away all of the good qualities and turns the season into an uncomfortable experience for the viewer. The ending with Connor is particularly depressing. I realize that only something that intense would make Angel go to Wolfram & Hart, but the question that should be asked is: Why would the show WANT to go there?  I know that the actress playing Cordelia got pregnant, but pregnancy doesn't have to be a bad thing - she could have been magically pregnant by Angel himself providing a twin brother for Connor or by something that would have been a "cure" for Angel. After Season Three, there were all sorts of wonderful possibilities that could have occurred. Call me old-fashioned, but I would have liked Cordelia to come back for a romantic time with Angel who would have been saved from the sea to become closer to Connor and make him a partner in the world-saving business.  Unfortunately, nothing positive was explored and the viewer is left with these wonderful characters in a big, depressing mess of circumstances that were just kind of... well... yucky! I probably would never have tuned in again, except that Spike shows up in the last season.  To understand the final season, you have to watch this season. Just realize that it's depressing - if you're having a bad time in your life, skip it and come back later 
 Well, it sounds like a great game, but after five hours of upgrading and downloading all of the specified programs and upgrades, I couldn't get the video to work at all, couldn't get technical support at all, and I gave up and have returned it to the manufacturer. a great disappointment because i love and still play the previous versions 
 That is the bottom line for this author.  She spends way too much time telling us to "embrace" our new, thick waistlines, and too little time on any real information or help.  Don't bother exercising. just give up and eat smaller amounts of whatever it is that made you fat in the first place, get 9 hours of sleep every night (good luck with that!) and eliminate all stress from your life. That's all you have to do, and then you'll only gain 10 pounds during menopause instead of 20 or 30.  Save your money 
 I normally don't write reviews for books, but I had to for this one because it is so bad, as many others have said. I too am a Gibson fan. But I want the time spent reading this book back, I feel it was so wasted.  I almost put the book down, but instead I foolishly hoped Gibson would somehow tie all the scattered, half hearted events together in the end. As many have said, you never find out what this "nodal point" is. The payoff NEVER comes.  You don't get close to really any of the characters. You want to get close to Rydell, but there is not enough of him there. There is WAY too much jumping around.  And there is way too much of "look at what a clever writer I am" by writing incomprehensible "creative" prose.  I don't know why some writers - even great writers- fail to grasp the most important point about writing: It's the STORY stupid.   This book is a chain of events that are disconnected, unfinished and unsatisfying. Read some of his earlier works, sure, but don't pick up this painted mess, regardless of what the so-called reviews on the cover say 
 I live in the ghetto(because the darkest blacks live there), am insecure about my nappy hair, will not climb the corporate ladder as swiftly as my light skinned peers, when choosing a mate I will desire a light skinned husband so that I can dip into a lighter gene pool, and finally, if I had to adopt a child I would REQUEST a light skinned one quicker than a dark one.  Slave talk, all of it!  I read this book (most of it) with a completely open mind and hoping for a well researched and fair study of black america's color complex. I ended up throwing this book across the room in frustration. This book perpetuates the myth more than black america. As a dark skinned female I felt horrible reading this, mothers don't let your babies read this, it can be SERIOUSLY detremental to ones development. In all honesty I can say with much authority (after all I have been black all of my life) that the very vast majority of black people do NOT think like this. I find it very hard to believe that it's no more than a coincidence that the authors are the two who benefit the most from the "color complex", a light skinned female and a dark male (because according to this book light skinned men lack the all important street credibility and dark skinned women are bitter and unattractive).  This is a disgraceful portrayal of what could have been a pivotal cultural study. Shame on them for perpetuating the myth 
 I found very little new here that has not been written a dozen times beforehand.  Although the title could lead a person to believe that this book is about the British and their strategy in the Revolutionary War down South, this is a bunch of battle histories strung together without a lot of analysis of strategy.  John Buchanan's THE ROAD TO GUILFORD COURTHOUSE is a bit better than this one, and mcuh cheaper 
 Honestly, nothing about this show grabs me. I'm surprised this show gets such high Nielsen ratings every week. The writers tend to come up with similar stories all the time. But the biggest flaw is the acting. It is really laughable. Me and my friends watch this sometimes to laugh at how ridiculous everyone seems to be. Horatio Caine talks in a slow drawl all the time, saying the stupidest and most obvious things. Calleigh is always smiling at everyone and everything up to the point it gets irritating. None of the C.S.I team displays any emotion whatsoever, oh...except Horatio when he over does it.   The stories are also terribly boring and utterly predictable. If there's a V.I.P suspect with a "history" with Horatio, yup...you guessed it, he's involved (either directly or indirectly). And also, if the suspect appears in about 10 minutes into the show...yea, it's not him. And Calleigh gets "evidence" such as DNA from saliva etc almost every episode using her sexuality. I mean, once or twice is alright...but I've seen about 8-10 episodes and she does it all the time. Every criminal here is an idiot, they are sure to leave all kinds of huge "clues" leading to them or their alliances. And every crime gets solved all the time. Oh, and is it just me or does the C.S.I team seem to know everything under the sun at their fingertips, no need for books or researching, they already have it that big brain of theirs. Think that's unlikely? Exactly my point.  In short, I wouldn't move appointments or hurry home to watch this show. In fact, even if someone gives me this DVD set as a gift, I would probably keep it aside or maybe present it to someoene else. Watch this show if you're REALLY bored, with nothing else to do and no better use of your time. If you want real Crime Scene Investigation, watch the original C.S.I, Las Vegas. That's the best C.S.I....period 
 This book combined an exciting title with quite disappointing content to me. This is definitely not a book for those looking for solid analysis of the future of markeing and advertising, but just a laundry list of all exciting eye-catching gimmicks using wireless technologies. It looks like a cursory pachworks of materials from newspaper columns rather than a condensed book. 
 He knows how to write, but unfortunately his grasp of reality is weak.  All the ills of the world can be attributed to the USA, where Chomsky has gotten rich and successful.  The self delusion in the book is amazing 
 I purchased this book after reading an excerpt of it, and it has exceeded all of my expectations and then some. Dr. Saltz outlines her theories and explains them in a way that we can all relate to(EVERYONE has done some storytelling), in a way that makes sense, and to top it off it doesn't want to make you run out and get mad at the world for all of your problems, if anything it makes you a little more empathetic. I'm a firm believer in the theory that you can't successfully change what you don't understand, and this book helps to provide that understanding in a concise way. Dr. Saltz gives numerous examples of patterns of behavior, how you may have come to exhibit it, and how you can change it (if that's what you want to do). For anyone that feels stuck or just confused about why their life is the way it is, this book is an excellent tool to help clear up some confusion. It's not preachy and is written in a conversational way that's easy to read. This book has helped me immensely 
 I was pretty much dissapointed with this album, I just did not like many of the tracks, except for "once upon a time in the projects" and 2 or 3 others, this album really falls short. For some reason every one I talked to says this is his best album, I don't know what they are thinking but I did not like this album one bit. In my opinion Cube's best albums were after this one, but was at his best with NWA. Nothing on this album will impress you 
 Read the Amazon editorial review, they are tiptoeing around saying this movie doesn't really work.    Modern language, ideas, and sensibilities make the whole thing feel like a contrived stage play.  And it seems to be mostly on stage sets ... there isn't much of Venice in here, so don't rent it for that reason.  (Notice I said rent ...)    The script is weak.  The setup for the lead character's transition to life as a courtesan is abbreviated and unconvincing.  There are too many horrible moments for this to be romantic.  The story has so much more potential.  The only reason to see this movie is to check out Catherine McCormack.  Rufus Sewell is always good as well.  Otherwise the casting is absurd.  Fred Ward and Oliver Platt stand out as being miscast.  Jacqueline Bisset fails to persuade here 
 The writers used the character names, and the book name, but nothing else The explanation of the 3 laws was ridiculous The art work of the robots was good Will Smith did his usual fantastic job as an actor, but the writers gave him poor material and where comedy was called for it went over like a lead balloon. I Robot is part of a series of Asimov books resolving around both human and robot characters.  The human and the robot both evolve and explore the meaning of life and humanity.  None of this appeared in the movie 
 This is a book by JA Jance?  This book took a potentially good storyline (plot) and made it seem stupid because it was so simplistic in its writing style, which is UNLIKE JA Jance.  This book seemed to be to be written for a young-adult reader audience.   I had to force myself to read it all the way through because I must admit, I was curious as to the conclusion, but I did not derive any pleasure from reading this book.  A waste of time 
 Who would ever wear this monstracity? First of all you got no color, no padding, no pazazz! This shirt makes the garbage bag I wear look like a royal tunic. It is also from a company called Jerzees and it's not a jersey? What up with that? Michael Jordan is probably spinning in his grave 
 If you're looking for a new take on the Victorian Christmas ghost story (as this novel claims to be), well, this may not be the book for you.  Palliser takes his time setting up this tale, in which the ghosts are more figurative than anything else.  The first 200 pages or so are filled with plot lines that seem to go nowhere and tales that have you moving from the 9th to the 17th to the 19th centuries.  Quite confusing, and, frankly, rather dull.  Had this been a short story, it would be quite good, but as a nearly 400 page novel it is simply tedious 
 i had to rate this book one star because there was no "ZERO"!  This book is complete garbage and the worst investment you can make to start your investment career.  There are other books on investing in this series, which do an incredible job for beginners.  Even the resource centers at any decent online broker has better information for you than this book has and the links won't go bad 
 There are really two, very parallel, stories told in this book, and they are only separated by a couple of million years. In the present, a young teenager named Vinny has convinced her mother to let her spend summer vacation with her father in Africa. Her father, Sam, is working in an archeological site in Africa without much success. Vinny turns out to be his good luck charm. Flip back to the past and we see a teenager called Li that is half-ape, half-human that thinks way beyond her time. Each chapter goes back and forth between past and present. A couple of times I was lost in the paleontology talk and the present storyline was a bit boring, but I liked the author's way of describing the past storyline 
 I did not care for the language nor the the theme and did not consider it to be a book linked with the Sweet Potato Queen 
 Clocking in at just under two hours, I LOVE YOUR WORK leaves the viewer feeling as though from the opening sequence that stones have been tied to your feet and your body thrown into the very deep and dank water to slowly settle into the mud at the bottom.  Sound dreary? Then avoid this little mess of a film.  It is hard to believe that Adrian Butchart who is giving us the radiant GOAL! THE DREAM BEGINS trilogy could help write this script: one wonders if writer/director Adam Goldberg didn't just bring him in for help.  The story is tired (small time guy gives up love for a career as a movie star with all the accessories of money, fame, celeb status, gorgeous wife, etc. only to find life in its simpler fashion was preferable) and the choices of casting this very dark and dreary tale are inappropriate.  Giovanni Ribisi, superb an actor though he most assuredly is, simply is not credible as a movie star sex symbol whose stardom is accompanied by alcoholism, self hate, paranoia, fragmented thinking, and bad decisions.  The only time we see anything vaguely suggestive of his ability to create a role is in the many flashback scenes (with girlfriend Christina Ricci): his on screen chemistry with his famous wife Mia (the enormously talented Franka Potente who here is wasted in a mannequin's role) is nil, and his interplay with such actors as Vince Vaughn, Marisa Coughlan, Judy Greer, Shalom Harlow, Joshua Jackson,  Jason Lee, and Elvis Costello is unilateral.  Goldberg films this boring redundant tale using all manner of artsy camera tricks that only serve to make the tedium increase.  With a cast like this the product had promise.  Goldberg needs some time to think about this phase of his career.  Grady Harp, November 06 
 Warning only read this book if you are brain dead, wearing rose colored glasses, and will believe anything you are told by the Peterson legal camp both former and current as well as his supporters...if this description fit's you will love this book 
    All this is iis a bunch of 1:00 long songs that are all crap. They should have put This Might Be A Wiki or at least Boss of Me on here. But, unfortunately, it's a FLOP! FLOP! FLOP! Useless noise!      LOCAL CRAZY MONKE 
 This book is taken almost word for word in the intro from the movie "Patton" based on Ladislas' book.  It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men.  Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be  idolized.  He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over  the men he lost.  Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make  today 
 I was excited to find a book filled with fun, fresh summer ideas but one look inside and I was so disappointed. The premise of the book is fresh, easy meals that appeal in those lazy summer days and nights yet the book is filled with not terribly interesting, not terribly difficult but very fussy meals. Who needs that in the summer? and who needs this book -- certainly not me 
 My player read CD-RWs for about three weeks, then all of a sudden it got picky and only wants to read CD-Rs! I tested the RWs in my portable boombox from Wal-mart that was like 10 bucks and the CD-RWs played perfectly! I bought this Walkman b/c I constantly change my playlists and you can do that as often as you want with rewriteable CDs. If the product doesn't do as it advertises --"plays both CD-Rs and RWs"-- it's worthless in my book. The radio is mediocre.   Anyway, if you don't have a problem burning *permanent* discs or lugging around your portfolio of CDs, this thing is good enough, but you may as well buy a "regular" (non-fancy) portable CD player for half the price which does the same things as this $40 one! If you do mind and/or you change playlists as often as you change your socks, join the new millenium and buy an mp3 player instead. I love Sony, but they dropped the ball with this one. (I'm opting for the new pink mp3 Walkman Bean, just as cute, but more functional).  
 I found the book to be a slow read primarily because the use of the English language is so different. 
 I am just so sad to have this wonderful series end so badly.  I do not believe for a minute that Mrs. Braun is still writing these books and whoever is should STOP.  Polly gone, the barn burns and Qwill doesn't seem to care about either.  I will not accept the character of Barbara.  The worst thing of all is that I do not even like Qwill anymore! I will never read another and that is sad to me 
 Even though we in America have peace and a booming economy, Bill Clinton does not deserve all the credit as many want to give him.  A truly great president leads in times of struggle and disarray. Before George Bush was  considered the worst president ever by so many, he had fantastic approval  ratings because he earned them.  He also led us through a war and a  recession.  But many would just claim he was the cause for these problems.   Bill Clinton just inherited peacetime and an improving economy and  considers himself to be a wonderful president.  Its a shame he will be  remembered by so many as a great president who supposedly brought on peace  and a healthy economy when it really was the work of so many decent, moral  Americans 
 It takes too long to set up (sticking all the leaves through the hive). By the time I'm done, the kids have lost interest. They had more fun just playing with the bees separately 
 From the 5 star reviews it is clear that Mr. McCarry has found his target audience, Clinton-hating yahoos who will never tire of hearing the same old recycled trash.  And by putting it in a novel he doesn't have to even justify it, just hint, hint.  Another advantage of this target audience is, apparantly, that one need not be able to plot, develop characters, dialogue, or any of the usual writerly skills, just type out the right code-words and one is home.  
 Someone gave me this book and told me how thrilling it was. Halfway through, I find myself still reading it mostly to laugh at the horrible writing and melodromatic style. It's a little depressing to think that millions of readers have made this guy rich and famous on such awful writing. It's good for me to pick up a book like this now and then to be reminded that by avoiding the most popular authors, I'm not missing much. 
 Oh my God!  Now, I'm a major horror buff and I appreciate cheesy B films, even C films!  But this one, like someone else said, was just plain awful.  The actors were no good, you can tell that it was really low budget 'cause you can hear the echo when they spoke (think porn movies).  I gave it 1 star because I had no choice.    Too put it in short, I would suggest NOT buying any Maverick films, Creepyflix films, and some (NOT ALL) Anchorbay and Lionsgate films.  Oy 
 This wasn't a good followup to Blue to me.  It would have helped if LeAnn Rimes didn't sing too LOUD on this one!  While the emphasis is on inspirational songs, the music comes off as overproduced, overblown and LeAnn tries to pull off her own Celine Dion by overdoing it a third on most of the ballads.  Even the remake of Debbie Boone's overplayed You Light Up My Life comes off as limp. The listening performance comes off as as disturbing and misconceived, not inspiring at all as the album title wants you to believe. It's like LeAnn was pressured to get a record out on the market after the massive success of Blue. Would have been better if she sang an album of new material instead back in 1997. 
 This is an interesting, knowledgeable, but very short and skimpy, paperback book by a professor of neurobiology whose perspective is that of a primatology/evolutionary psychologist. The book contains some tiny photographs of the primates in question. It is a decent addition to the collection of anybody who is obsessed with learning every last thing about our various ape relatives.   My complaint/concern is that the author's description of the book, and the example photos shown on Amazon, might lead one to expect it to contain high quality photographs. Instead, what you get is a tiny paperback of miniscule, grainy, terribly reproduced amateur black-and-white photographs by the professor, many of them shot at the zoo.   Do NOT be deceived by the lovely color photographs in the publicity. There are no color photographs, or well-reproduced photographs, except on the front and back covers. Really, this has the feel of a home-made vanity press kind of book.   For a more thorough treatment of the topic of human/ape nature, consider reading Frans De Waal's "Our Inner Ape". De Waal also published a book of gorgeous photographs of primates. For a more thorough exploration of evolutionary psychology, see Pinker's How The Mind Works.  
 It seems absolutely amazing that almost every book of pseudo science on Amazon has an avid following of reviewers who, after reading the cited volume, have found the ultimate truth of the universe. This one is obviously no exception.   I simply point to the review below mine written by Eric Tiller. In his review he points to 8 "well researched" points. The only one that really stands out to me is point #5. The rest of the list is simply a bunch of philosophical mumbo jumbo which might bring one to go "Hmmmm", but certainly shouldn't make anyone think they may have seen the hidden face of some creator. So there exist 7 points that say, "Wow, cool look at this isn't wild! You know science has no explanation why this happens the way it does. Therefore it must be the design of some unseen creator".   It is the same old tired argument used by the Intelligent Design community. If you can't see how flimsy the argument is to begin with, I truly feel sorry for you. Trying to prop it up further with more pseudo science, hand waving and inferrence doesn't make it any more believable or substantial.  
 For the sake of honesty, I'll admit right now that I have read only the pages that are posted here on Amazon.  That was enough, however, for me to encourage anyone interested in reading this book to first try the following:  Read about Isaiah's reaction to an actual encounter with God in Isaiah 6:1-5.  Compare Isaiah's reaction to statements in this book such as references to the Sovereign Creator God as "Mr. Anti-Easy," (pg 16) and the attitude reflected in the words "he'd better get used to [my saying] 'God, surprise me.'" (pg 17)   Something tells me Isaiah would not have been quite so bold 
 From the reviews I had read about this book, it was supposed to be an intellectual, highly appealing and enchanting updated version of a classic children's story in which the dwarves are not really dwarves but rather sexually charged men who each take their turns having sex with Snow White in the shower (and only the shower, never in a bed). Snow White is seeking her Prince Charming, whose name is Paul. The wicked stepmother, whose name is Jane, is out to get Snow White. And one of the "dwarves", Bill, doesn't like to be touched...by anyone. Other than that, there wasn't much else I understood about this book. It was a very disjointed book. The writing was stilted and had the feel of a foreigner speaking in a second language. The conversations were completely unrealistic and the voices in my head, while reading, kept on speaking in a mechanical drone; no expression or hint of emotions. Really, really, really, wasn't worth the three evenings I spent reading it. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has read and understood this book, but I certainly would not recommend purchasing it 
 The only book I've ever read that I tore up and threw in the trash when I was finished. If this passes for an uplifting magical fable then there's something seriously wrong with the world.This is a tragic, sad, grotesque, disturbing tale of a child so traumatized that he has to make up an alternate reality just to cope with the horror of the world. When a child is damaged it is never uplifting, whimsical or funny and anyone who finds it so better take a deep look into themselves and make some changes. This book is sickening. Don't buy it!!! There are no animals only pain and death 
 I have loved each and every one of Jane Hamilton's other novels and highly recommend them:  The Book of Ruth, A Map of the World, Short History of a Prince and Disobedience.  This book, sadly, does not rank among them.  It feels forced and uninteresting, with outlandish and unrecognizable characters and scenarios.  I've already paid for it, so I'll probably try to finish it, but don't waste your time or money.  Read another Hamilton instead 
 I have enjoyed the Miss Julia books tremendously but this is my least favorite. Miss Julia is married to Sam Murdoch. Poor guy is sent to find the missing Hazel Marie in one part and is gone for a good deal of the story. Miss Julia does not even make a case of those missing hours! It is as if the author could really care less. There are so many little plots that you feel as if the author had several ideas and just took one and expanded it but left the others to show all the complications in this woman's life. There are times when Miss Julia seems to self-centered and the tongue in cheek mood of the other books in this series is really not present here. I found her less likable and also less believable. She has taken in her husband's mistress ad illegitimate child. Now, there is a question about the child's paternity and she is tolerating the whole thing!!!!! Perhaps other books in the series would be a better intro for the uninitiated 
 I felt like I was watching a poorly made horror movie that included casual sex while the killer was planning his next move. I can deal with there being a rape or murder because all suspense books are based on some type of violence, but did there have to be such graphic detail? I only finished it because I wanted to know who the psycho was.  All violence put aside, it was a decent suspense story but didn't include any romance whatsoever. Casual sex does not equal romance in my book. Reader discretion advised: rape, murder, lots of casual sex, adult scenes and overall violence. Not on my bookshelf anymore 
 I wanted wanted wanted to love this book. I wanted wanted wanted to..... But not. I bought it because it was one someone's list who read a lot of books that I really enjoyed....  but probably specifically because I just finished Richard Morgan's books (which had digitized conciousness as a major theme -- which played a big part in this one).....  Now, I am a big fan of great storyline, interesting characters as number 1 and number 2 driving forces..... However, the HUGE lack of number 3 makes me give this only two stars....  And number 3 is:  LOGICAL CHARACTER MOTIVATION!   I really did not understand why the characters in this book did what they did.  And that was really a let down.  It seemed amateur-ish in a way....  Relationships flipflopped.....  Friends betrayed friends....  and I sat there, reading, not understanding why......  I'm not even over my first century (being in my mid 30s), and I can still understand my (and my friends) motivations.....  Maybe I'm just naive?  Yes, the digitized conciousness was interesting.  The world that was built (ad hoc and Bitchun and Whuffie?) was interesting....  There were good parts.....  but I really didn't grasp the motivations and why the characters did what they did, and I nearly put the book aside because of that.  It was really not up to the reviews here on Amazon.....  So, I would say that the ideas and world was cool and interesting --- but, personally I would say that Richard K. Morgan does it better.  Very differently, less light-hearted, darker, but fuller and richer, more complex and meaty....   
 It wasn't as impactful as I thought it would be.  Some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others, well, other gave comments.  The selection of people was a good cross section but it didn't have meaning to it.  I was looking for more in depth commentary.  Maybe what I was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book.  It might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together 
 Other reviewers baffle me.    The metaphors are syrupy, the advice either obvious or suspect, and everything a dash too cute.  Anecdotes bore, ramble, though some of the quotes are interesting.  What use the technical advice may have had is probably gone with time, and what remains handy is rather obvious.    Some of the discussion on particular pieces may be useful for those actually playing them at present; I'm not, but even if I were, I'm not sure I could stomach the prose again.  I love the piano, too, truly, and it's always nice to share thoughts with someone with similar feelings, but Cooke's fondness for the instrument verges on the pedophilic 
 Crime mob? Give me a break. What kind of crime are you committing in your stilletos? This is ridiculous, IQ lowering, inbred, country, porch monkey, southern crunk krap! Why would you listen to something that you know is going to make you dumber and in the same breath set black people back 100 years. It is insulting for people of the world to see your videos and think all black people are like you. The beats on this album are corny, the lyrics sound like my seven year old wrote them, and the hooks give me the craps. Please stop rapping and pursue a promising career at target 
 Although this book had some interesting things to say, it was, in general, too "compact" for its own good. Bruegmann's arguments against traditional anti-sprawl histories read more like a jedi mind trick than a careful argument. A more careful argument with more supporting facts would have added to the book. As it is, it seems to me that this book will do little to change anyone's view of the 21st century city 
 Open Professor Marmot's book to almost any page and see him make firm statements and firm conclusions about research and anecdotal evidence which are in fact quite uncertain.  It seems reasonable that status affects health, indeed I believe it does, but Professor Marmot throws anecdotes or questionable research conclusions at the troublesome fact that healthier people will achieve greater status, or in other words that healthier people are healthier.    Professor Marmot cares only about "inequality", not evil.  For example, he appears to see no difference between the millions of Russians murdered by Stalin during Communist rule and the millions of Russians who have had shortened life expectancies during the collapse and aftermath of Communist rule, supposedly as a result of "inequality".  Could these tens of millions of deaths have been due to people like Professor Marmot who sought a government-mandated end to inequality, and not to inequality itself?  Perhaps because the book promotes a politically correct, leftist, government-solution, tax and spend agenda as a solution for "inequality", it does not appear to have attracted serious criticism of its scholarship. 
 The movie is ok but it is a superior film in Cantonese. The dubbed English is awkward and detracts from the film. I find the "dubbing" very annoying and would prefer the vintage Hong Kong Jackie Chan films marketed in the US be provided in the original language. Argggh 
 Have you ever felt that sinking feeling that you have been duped?  This is the absolute worst book I have ever read.  They say that a monkey if given enough time can write Shakespeare.  Well, this is the other book written by a Chimp... and you are a Chump if you buy this. Inside this "book" are the most juvenile and painful stories and reviews. My 8 year old grandaughter could write better. I can't say enough bad things about this "book". So, don't buy it new, don't buy it used..at any price. Close your eyes and pick any other book on Amazon..you will have made a better choice. An Avid Sci-fi Horror reader. 
 Thought it would be great, but actually scared my dog and when he got over his fear he was unable to get near enough to play with it. Needless to say he did not get enjoyment out of it. Can't recomend 
 Most readers are familiar with Morgan Spurlock's movie "Super Size Me," which used humor, a compelling personal story, and visual effects to make a vital point about the impact of fast food on the American diet. This book is an attempt to follow up that movie. Unfortunately, the same Morgan Spurlock who presented an affable image in the movie comes across as somewhat petty and immature in this book.   Part of the problem lies in the difference between the media. The type of larger-than-life images and statements that made "Super Size Me" so interesting do no translate well into print. In several cases, the author cites "expert" sources without mentioning their biases. For example, Neil Barnard of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine is cited liberally without mention that his specialty is psychiatry rather than nutrition and that his organization seems as much concerned with animal rights as with human health.  Regardless of the credibility of the sources cited, the writing style is simply too juvenile to be effective. The author has a running joke of inserting "mmm" followed by the name of an item in parentheses. The first two or three times this pattern is amusing. Nevertheless, after frequent repetition it wears out its welcome.   The most troubling aspect of this book is the author's occasional use of personal attacks. It seems that Mr. Spurlock is a little sensitive about criticism of his film by various advocacy groups that represent the fast food industry. One of the author's most vocal opponents happens to have the first name "Richard." Rather than refuting the substance of Richard's arguments, the author makes a point of renaming him "Dick." This third-grade insult style does little to enhance the credibility of this book.  If you are interested in knowing more about the negative impact of fast food on American health and culture, by all means rent or buy the DVD "Super Size Me." When it comes to books about the topic, however, skip this book and focus instead on Eric Schlosser's "Fast Food Nation." Interestingly, Schlosser's book is now being made into a movie, and it will be interesting to see if that work can transfer from one medium to another more successfully than Morgan Spurlock's work 
 Anyone who's remotely acquainted with Weineberg's rubbish poliemics touted as impartial history will know his ingrained hatred of everything German, that he trashes all German sources as unreliable or apologias, that he has done no primary researches on his own, that he recycles all the hate propaganda against the Germans, that his preconceptions of Germans being innately evil are reflected in all his so called works and that HE WILL SPARE NO EFFORTS IN FALSIFYING HISTORY TO PROVE HIS POINT.  So caveat emptor 
   I JUST OPENED BOX AND WAS SURPRISED TO SEE THAT IT IS 24IN, WIDE...NOT 30 AS ADD STATES...SEEMS FLIMSY ...wOULD RETURN IF NOT SUCH A HASSEL... 
 The author is indifferent regarding the development of masculine characteristics. The positive reviews seem to be from readers who sought the book because it reinforces their own predisposition to raising children androgenously. That does not make this a good book 
 this sucks so very much I wish it were a vacume cleaner and not a lame CD.   
 I am not sure why this book was written, except maybe, the author wanted to add another title to his published works. This book is basically comprised of briefs from various chapters of the author's two previous books (which were very good, by the way). If you have read his two previous books and/or you are a seasoned manager, the book is repetetive and boring. The author gives many examples of real life scenarios but the stories go on and on for pages. A good book to read if you can't fall aslee 
 After reading this book, I would like to make three points about it:  1.) First of all, DON'T MAKE THIS YOUR FIRST DEAN KOONTZ BOOK.  This is the second book of the so-called Christopher Snow trilogy.  Read the first book in the trilogy first -- FEAR NOTHING.  The first book introduces pretty much all the key characters that you find in this book.  2.) Second, please be aware that Koontz has yet to write the third book in the Christopher Snow trilogy.  This is a real shame, because SEIZE THE NIGHT ends on a cliffhanger of sorts.  Koontz has claimed that he will write the third book someday, under the title RIDE THE STORM.  But since it's been over eight years since Koontz has written a Snow novel, I wouldn't expect this book anytime soon.    3.) Third, I must admit I didn't really care for this book at all, and I say that as a Koontz fan.  Lots of padding -- the action doesn't really start until page 250.  Koontz wastes a LOT of space repeating things he originally wrote in FEAR NOTHING.   I found myself skipping through this book quite a bit to get to the good parts.  The plot here is also too over the top -- plot elements include time travel, killer monkeys, alternate realities, serial killers conducting government experiments -- and that's just the tip of the iceberg!  Even the characters in the book don't seem to take any of it seriously.  All the dialogue in this book is whimsical and unrealistic.  I was therefore never able to suspend disbelief for this book.  It was just too silly for my tastes.  Koontz is a great writer, but his best novels are the ones that have a more believable, fast-paced plot.  Instead of this book, I would therefore recommend WATCHERS, INTENSITY, ODD THOMAS or VELOCITY.  
 I used to be a big proponent of Netgear.  Not anymore. First off, after reading the package on the VPN box, I believed the software client was included, but no.  Once I figured that out, I bought the software, which costs more than the router.  After a week of hacking, I finally got the software to work, on one out of 4 machines.  One machine hard re-boots if you try any kind of network activity once the VPN is connected.  I've disabled everything I can think of, it just won't work.  It won't work with Vista either, no word from Netgear on a date.  All other VPN software has to be un-installed, so forget using one machine to connect to a Netgear, Watchguard, Cisco, etc. vpn.  Very frustrating software 
 Amazon strung me along for months before delivering only one volume of the five volume set.  Get it somewhere else 
 I regret to inform that Anne Rice has been reduced from an open minded author with original ideas, to a narrow minded christian.  This book will be interesting for: * those who have never read or heard about the time period Jesus grew up * christians and other book-religious people  Otherwise, nothing really interesting happens in this book. At least for people who have been exposed to more than a bible.  I'm sorry to lose such a great author to the, in my opinion, real dark side. I give it 2 stars for the research work, 0 for the story.  Sorry, Anne Rice. I will still read your old book 
 I purchased this book because everyone in the community was gaga over it. What I found when I actually looked at it was that all it is is a bunch of pretty pictures and that's the big wow. Sure, the recipies are good, but they're not "Oh my G-d!" like everyone is about this book. It's got menues and organization tips. All in all, I'd say that this is a good book for someone who is young and just getting married who has never had to cook meals before. If you are an advanced cook who likes to make your own menues, is familiar with other recipies that are similar, and enjoys challenging recpies, this is not the book for you. It was sort of a disapointment. It's mostly hype 
 The author spends the entire book pontificating about how eBay has and will change the way consumers buy and sell things. While he has this general trend correct, and this is interesting to ponder, the author uses the book as a platform to conveniently mention and promote (by name) his own auction dropshop business.   Further, he states that soon auction dropshop locations will be as prevalently widespread as Starbucks. I think not. In fact, the auction dropshop store that opened in my neighborhood closed due to lack of interest after just a few months.  The fact is eBay and other online auction sites are changing things because they eliminate a middle man and wonderfully facilitate consumer to consumer transactions. That the author is a middle man himself is telling. And that he seems to believe that these dropshop businesses will thrive is way off base, and demonstrates a clouded lack of understanding of the marketplace based upon his own ulterior motives.  The book is not well-written either. Each chapter seems just like a re-read of the last chapter (like filler) and it doesn't really progress any new ideas that weren't already made early on in the book.    
 I have read several of Connelly novels starting with the Closers and reading most of them back to the Poet. I have held the Poet as being Connelly's poorest example of prose until I read A Darkness More Than Night. As a college educated individual I found that it took too far fetched that a FBI profiler would base his entire profile off of two individuals having the same name. As a literature student I found each scene/chapter of the book to be a repeat of the one before it or one found in another book. Also Connelly puts so much weight on Bosch's character and then undermines his position, which destroys the book. He also portrays Kiz Rider as having a disease rather than being lesbian, why should she be afraid to say that she is gay? Why should a writer use a character's sexuality as an element of mystery? As a law student I found every court scene to be more like any ABC/CBS drama than reality. Some have said that this is a good read because Connelly "weaves" other characters from his books into this one, but like a "greatest hits" album the actual album is always stronger than the compilation. The Narrows, Lost Light and The Closers are much stronger books and more worth your time 
 I think the author is so enamored with her hipness, that she has convinced a wimpy editor to not edit out all the crap, crap, crap.  Horrid, boring, blathering writing.  She goes on, and on, and on.  She could say what she means in half the words.  Waste of time to read this.  (Must she continue with the "yo mama" and the "goddess" this and that-- and Grrrr can't stand her 
 I agree with the reviewers who found this series "stuffy, predictable and annoying" and advised, "You might as well buy a romance novel." (Or a super-heroes comic book for the action parts.) What horrified me was that one reviewer mentioned Peters in the same sentence with Jane Austen and the Brontes!! Austen did not condone much of the absurdity and pomposity of her time, but chose to demonstrate it, rather than rant or lecture against it, as many authors and poets were doing.  In a few simple sentences she skewered inheritance laws' cruel unfairiness to women. The little girl asks, "Why do we have to move?" and her mother explains simply, matter-of-factly, that's the way it is.  As outrageous as the law itself is the docile,(seemingly) unquestioning acceptance of it.  Austen didn't go into an enraged diatribe, just assumed her readers were perceptive enough to get the message.  Peters would do well to emulate really good writers: demonstrate talents and other qualities with actions and events, rather than repetitive, tiresome descriptions 
 This book on the black market makes a case for going back to views popular in the 1960s.  In the 1960s, the black market was populated with cold-war spies and gun running free-booters.  Since then, the popular press has painted the black market as a drug running paradise.  Naylor tries to convince us this image is a lie.  The real black market criminals are capitalist executives in the military-industrial complex.  Defined in this manner, 'Wages of Crime' becomes a traditional left wing vehicle for brow beating those unwilling to genuflect before Marxist-Leninist dogma.   This critique is not limited to attacks on the US political establishment.  At one point Naylor laments that Gorbachev's generation 'forgot its ideological roots'.  On another page, Naylor describes the proletarian interests in South East Asia.  The reader won't find the standard pulp crime stories here, which is a blessing.  Unfortunately, the book relies on rhetorical flourish rather than statistics. Thus, it simply substitutes one stereotype with a second.    The text was pulled from independent articles, so the flow is sometimes uneven.  For example, a chapter seeking to debunk the political might of heroin/cocaine dealers tries to convince the reader that drugs are of marginal economic importance.  He complains that the published estimates of drug dealer wealth are too high by perhaps a factor of 100.  In another chapter, rich drug dealers engage in crimes with military-industrial complex.  
 After the shocking change of the mood and complete destruction of the series in "Narcissus in Chains", this book was somewhat bearable. There is a story to follow (weak but better than the previous one), there is a crime scene and even though Dolph has gone completely mental, he is included in the story. Unfortunately Anita is still jumping everything that has a pulse, and each scene takes up pages and pages *yawn*. Everything seems to be only about sex, and it is really tiresome. The crimes, whatever is happening outside the bedroom walls, seem to have no importance. They are just there .... Quite sad !!!  The book is not awful (very close though) and it's not good either. Just .... bearable !!! 
 The Big Rock Candy Mountain is a novel writen by Wallace Stegner.  I have heard many great things about Stegner's work, so i picked this up with  much anticipation.  Perhaps his other books are  much better, but this book is not good.  And when  I say that I'm being very gracious.  The story centers around a family of four, Bo,  his wife, Elsa, and their two sons Chester and Bruce. The novel follows them from place to place throughout America, about their poverty, and overall faliure.  The fundamental problem with the book is this:  You're supposed to feel bad for the family and their bad luck. But you don't because the author would rather give you  pointless detail (while ignoring important detail) than help you get to know and like the characters.  By the time that their lives are ruined you don't even like any of the  characters.  If the author had spent more time developing a mental relationship between you and this family than the book could pull the right strings.  Then there is also the question of possibility.  Is it really possible for a person (Bo the husband) to be naturally good at absolutly everything? And pushing it even further is it possible for this person to not be able to make any money what so ever.  In this book It describest this husband as being a great baseball player (yes he's hurt, but why not become a coach or something?), a nearly flawless hunter, and many other things.  Yet he remains broke for thirty years?  Also the seemingly dramatic parts of this book are more funny than dramatic.  Wallace Stegner may have written many other good books. Through his writing i can see some potential.  But in this book his potential even as a good writer only shows when he's "in a groove".  When he's in a groove he seems to have a tallent for writing, but when he's not, his sentences are long and jumbled and often don't even make sense.  If you don't believe me then here is the first sentence of the book just to prove it to you:  "The train was rocking through wide open country before Elsa was able to put off the misery of leaving and reach out for the freedom and release that were hers now."  See what i mean?  I'm sure that a writer such as Dickens or Hemingway never put down a sentence that confusing.  For that sliver of potential i award this book it's one and a half stars, but keep in mind, this may be the worst book i've ever read 
 I only used the cup 4 times before my trying to get the lid back on (not exactly easy because of push on design versus screw on), caused the inner lid seal to break. The lid is now worthless and needs to be replaced.  Now I have to deal with seeing if Amazon will help me replace the unit, even though I already sent the packaging to the recycler a week or so ago.  I would not recommend anyone purchasing this unit, due to the lid issue and other points made in the other comments herein 
 What trash and aimless drivel.  You'll find more truth at a liars anonymous gathering.  This book is not worthy of a long retort so I will simply say that it is TRASH!  There, I've done it now.  I've insulted trash.  I didn't think that was possible.. 
 This book did not teach me anything and was a waste of money. page 364:  Principles of Long term investing:  "Chapter 8 shows that among the S&P 500 Index returns, large value stocks have a small edge over large growth stocks."  Now look at Chapter 8.  "Of the 10 largest corporations, only 2  (Exxon Mobile and Citigroup) are value stocks."  duuhhh.  Now I know what to do.  I have a choice of two stocks.  If you already know all there is to know about the stockmarket, buy this book and pat yourself on the back for being so smart. If you know little, it won't add to your knowledge at all 
 I was given this book by my old English teacher, accompanied by high, exhaustive praise. But upon reading the first paragraph, I could tell this wouldn't be what I had set my hopes on. It truly is possible to get a generalized sense of what you're getting into with that first introduction, and what I found on that first page of Shanarra was an over-drawn, clumsily written length of description.  It honestly did not get better as the book went on. Pacing was a foreign concept to Brooks, apparently - hugely important moments happened within a few pages, sometimes even a few paragraphs, while you could spend double that following characters as they walked along. Transitions were sloppy, sometimes even using the word 'then' for lack of anything better, and I found that I was anticipating most of the plot 'twists' when they were first being hinted at. Deus ex machina should have been the catchphrase of the novel, and I will not flog a dead horse by going into how many things were ripped directly from Tolkien.  Shanarra is for those who found Lord of the Rings tiresome and tedious. For the rest of us, let's turn to other masters 
 Sadly, this book has a number of inaccuracies and is poorly researched.  It is obvious that the Ferrars rely to heavily on Robert Graves and his mythological theories, many of which have been debunked by better scholarship.  The rituals were bordering on insulting, especially the Greek ones.  It is obvious that they have never read a book on greek religion.  Additionally, they tend to be very heavy-handed on the opinion, and not as interested in fact as one would expect from the Ferrars.  If you want books on myth, please pass this one up 
 On avrage, I read fast.  I read a copy of the edition that was 264 pages.  Normanly that would take me 2 days.  This boring book took me about a week.  From the begining, this book was dull and hard to understand.  I would NOT recomend this book to anyone who doesn't history fiction.  It had some crude parts, as well 
 I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to "be nice to those we love" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch 
 This novel relies too much on far fetched ideas and coincidences.  I thought it was boring 
 Walter Mosley is normally a detective writer, known for his Easy Rawlins stories. Blue Light is a diversion into a genre that would fall somewhere between science fiction and new age. Various people in northern California are zapped with a blue light that makes them weird. According to the book's cover flap, the light brings out the potential of any person it strikes. However in the book it simply magnifies their existing personality. A smart girl becomes really smart, a young girl with quick reflexes becomes something of a ninja, and a promiscuous wife becomes a sex goddess. Mr Mosley is a talented writer. His prose and some of his action sequences makes this book readable. Unfortunately there's little balance between good and evil, which is problematic since the whole second half of the book is one long buildup of suspense towards a final apocalyptic encounter. Even more unfortunate is the fact the long awaited encounter is tedious and uninteresting. There's a few great and captivating scenes in this book, but otherwise extremely little to recommend itself 
 Just read the previous review (about 'simplifying' the language in Jungle Book). I am reading the ORIGINAL text JB to my eight year old son (for over a week now), and he's not once indicated that the language puzzles him.  He did ask me why Mowgli uses thee and thou and wouldst while talking with the animals, but  accepted my explanation without demur.  Reminds me of the lines from an Elinor Wylie poem "Our mutable tongue is like the sea  Curled wave and shattering thunder-fit;  Dangle in strings of sand shall he  Who smooths the ripples out of it." Say it out loud, and feel what it does to your mouth and face - that's what Kipling's prose does 
 I purchased this unit of beach cat sailing as I had hoped to use it as a starting watch and perfomance monitor. Unfortunetly I found the unit to be sub par at best. I used the unit for two days of sailing before it's failures became too great for me to deal with.  The first issue I experienced was the paint on the front all came off on the first day I used it after a touching it with sunscreen on my hands.  This isn't exactly something I would expect from an outdoors product.  The second issue I had with the unit was that it locked up frequently, requireing a reset of the unit. I am willing to tolerate a mild amount of this in an electronic product, but once every few hours was far too much.   The third issue and the one that really made it unusable for sailing was the pins that held the unit to the wriststrap would easily pop off when the unit was mildly bumped. I had the top pin pop out twice and the bottom pin pop out once while in the middle of a race. After each time I was forced to just take it off and stuff it in my pocket until after the race for fear the other pin might pop and I would loose the unit overboard.  I was excited when I saw the feature set of this unit, but I would say it has a long way to go to live up to what it is billed as 
 In my opinion, this book is a complete disaster.  I'd say it is a perfct example of what not to do when encountering other cultures.   I managed to make it only to page 42 and finally just threw the damm thing in the trash.    I don't know the ending to this sad tale, I only hope that the young lady he courted doesn't end up stuck in a foriegn country all alone.  Knowing what I know now I would not buy this book again because I was expecting good information about what to expect, instead I was exposed to diatribe about what is wrong with women 
 THE FIRE AND THE ROSE left me uncertain going into THE STAR TO EVERY WANDERING. The delay didn't help my confidence in the book any. Upon its release, I was shocked at the length--or lack thereof. Intrigued, I dove right in.  David said in the foreward that he was striving for a different kind of book with STAR than he did in the others. He certainly achieved that; unfortunately, I'm not entirely convinced that it was to the book's benefit. Where the earlier books were all about the characters, STAR was much more plot-driven. While it was appropriate for the character of Kirk, I also missed getting that kinds of insight, that depth, that we saw in the earlier two books in the trilogy.  While the reveal of the M'Benga numbers' purpose was something of a letdown, I think that the plot was even more of one. Thanks to the significant elements of time travel, at the end of the book nothing *happens*. Or worse, events unhappen--Picard never enters the nexus, never gets to experience that moment of family life. What that would change in the events in the later movies, I'm not prepared to say... but I think that's a fairly significant moment that's undone for no discernable reason.  For all that, though, the very end of the book taints what enjoyment I got when the plot wasn't giving me pause. I understand why editor Marco Palmieri asked for the change. But I don't think that the ending used - completely contradicting the "meaning of the work as a whole" of "City on the Edge of Forever", the episode that was the impetus for the ending as well as the first book in the trilogy - was any more appropriate.  I respect what David R. George III was trying to do with the CRUCIBLE trilogy. I'm afraid that he may have been handed an impossible task, though 
 We need a little more information.  The chair LOOKS great!  But what kind of material is it constructed from?  How big is it?  A side view would be helpful also to see how the back curves.  The price is good, now if I just knew a little more.. 
 yes this book is about a love story between bussy and dame monsoro.  her husband monsoro is not getting any, how would you feel. this book teaches you a lesson and this lesson, don't buy books you don't know, cause they [are bad 
 I expected to find more practical information in the book. There wasn't much.. 
 I found this book to be hard to read.  Take the chapter headings: who is the toddler, the challenges of being a toddler, the question of temperament...  Can you tell exactly are these about?  I can't.  Compare this with Your Two Year Old by Gesell Institute - chapters are: general characteristics of the age, the child with other children, techniques, accomplishments and abilities... The chapter headings indicate to me a much clearer organization.  If I want to know what is an age appropriate skill, I go to the accomplishments section, if I want to know how to manage a behavioral concern, I go to techniques.  The Lieberman book also uses bold face to describe some allegedly actual scenes, and it describes several in a row in unnecessary detail without directly commenting on any of them.  When it does offer advice, it is often in the form of oblique truisms, instead of simple suggestions.  It just seems like a waste of words. You can infer from the truisms what she thinks is a good way to handle certain situations, but she doesn't make it easy to find.  The Gesell book is more likely to give very concise explanations of possible behaviors, reasons for the behaviors, and good ways to manage them.    I found the Gesell book much more interesting reading because it is clearly written, and also much more useful as a reference because it is well organized. 
 If you want honesty about half-century of suburban sprawl dominance in the United States, then this book is NOT for you.  Once again the truth that academics can be completely out of touch with reality is revealed.  To get the full facts about sprawl, especially sprawl culture, sprawl politics and sprawl industry corruption of our political system, then read Sprawl Kills - How Blandburbs Steal Your Time, Health and Money 
 This review is of the short story "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" only.  This is the first story I've read by Washington Irving, and it'll most likely be my last. I grew up watching the Disney cartoon "The Legend of Sleep Hollow" from 1958, which was narrated by Bing Crosby.  It was the only thing that helped me envision this story, as I found the writing very bland and needlessly wordy.  It's as if the author just liked seeing his own words on paper.  I found the narration to skip, rendering it muddled, and I was at a loss if it was an unseen narrator, the author himself, or whomever.  I didn't get a sense of any character, and the horseman was nearly nonexistent.  I can see why the 1999 movie "Sleepy Hollow" with Johnny Depp needed much revamping, as this story is very mind numbing.  I do not recommend 
 If you are looking for a colonial history book, move on.  This book has no maps, few dates and is told from the POV of individuals with little or inconsistent details or context from chapter to chapter.  Occasionally the writing is good, more often the author seems to be enamored of his own attempts at being clever or cute.  Repeatedly editorializes about what a historical figure would have thought or done.  If you are very familiar with colonial history and can deal with the authors writing style you might enjoy this book.  If you are serious about your history this is most certainly not the book for you 
 I have not recieved the vitamins!!!!!!!!!  Lost in the mail??????   Please let me know what I can do, it has been a month 
 I am so disappointed.  I remember doing this as a child with far superior results.  Why do they have to make toys so cheaply now.  I would gladly pay more for a toy that actually does what it says.  It does not spin fast enough to evenly distribute paint.  My daughter has not seemed to mind yet and is enjoying the toy but knowing how it should operate I am very disappointed.  
 I stopped reading the Kay Scarpetta series after the first three books, and after reading this, the worst so far, I remember why: because I don't like any of the main characters. Which is a shame, because the author is skilled, the plot lines are really good, and the forensic medical detail is fascinating. Unfortunately this latest effort quickly degenerates into a weepy, whiny pity party for Kay Scarpetta, with everyone explaining everyone else's inadquacies by forcing their own patronizing pop-psychology 'insights' down other's throats. Way too much of the book is taken up with this nonsense, and the dialog becomes totally unbelievable. A hasty last-minute grafting of an international plot twist late in the book does nothing to mitigate the soap-opera quality and irritating personalities of all the people in it.  Lucy, who started in the Scarpetta series as a brat who needed a serious spanking, has developed into such an angry neurotic that it's beyond comprehension that she passed the FBI / ATF psych tests during the hiring process. Of course, Lucy is now a stereotyped lesbian as well. Lucy's subplot in this book is a clumsy and needless complication that serves only to fill a lot of boring pages and never goes anywhere beyond the requisite awful-parent issues.  Marino has also degenerated from an annoying but harmless redneck to a truly wacko jerk. How someone so ignorant, narrow-minded, and incompetent could make it to the ranks of detective is also beyond comprehension. In Black Notice, Marino has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and Scarpetta herself keeps telling him to be quiet and go away. Obviously she doesn't think too highly of him either, so why does she waster her time with this clown? The promising subplot with Marino's new supervisor quickly goes from being his problem to yet another poor-Dr-Kay, being betrayed by her own people issue(yawn) - the sudden resolution of which is a total cop-out, excuse the pun.  And then there's Scarpetta herself, who used to be interesting in the beginning of the series, but changed into a self-pitying, sanctimonious rich witch who is more concerned with her status toys (BMW, expensive house, antique furniture), and safeguarding her official power than with doing her job, except as a boost to her overinflated ego. This is not a character your average pay-check stretching, just-getting-by reader could identify with. And it took her far too long to figure out the 'long, soft baby hair'clue - she is supposed to be a hotshot medical examiner, after all. If she spent less time trying to get back at people out to ruin her, and more on working her actual cases, she'd get these insights sooner. Of course, in a story with so many tangled, unnecessary and ultimately unresolved subplots, it's hard to imagine anyone getting anything done at all.   It's a shame that this book was such a dog. I have great respect for this author's writing ability, which kept me turning the pages even when I wanted to throw the book across the room. I just hope that her future efforts focus more on plot - her great skill - and ease up on the annoyance factor of her increasingly strident characters. Surely they have some redeeming qualities. It's far past time to let them shine through 
 ...I mean, after all, this is the Ironman series we're talking about...but for content, avoid this.  Rather, do yourself a favor and pick up Franco Columbo's book.  It is far, far superior and will give you much better results, and much superior advice.  However, all the other Ironman books, with the exception of the "natural bodybuilding" book, should be picked up 
 While a good idea, the truck is poorly made.  The truck pieces that hook together fall apart whenever my 4-yr. old son tries to roll it across the floor, and he ends up very frustrated.  I ordered a replacement for it, thinking we just had a defective one, but the new one has the exact same problems.  You're better off spending your money on something else 
 This product is horrifying. It worked for three months, at which point it experienced a complete meltdown. Started getting Auto-Protect errors, and suddenly could access the internet with Explorer, but not Firefox. It kept trying to send me to Live Update, which wouldn't work, so I uninstalled and reinstalled Norton. Now the error happened again, and I could access the internet with Firefox, but not Explorer. An error message referred me to an online "fix," but -- guess what! -- you can't access any of their fixes with Firefox. You MUST be using Explorer. (Which is, in and of itself, offensive and obnoxious.) Explorer, of course, wasn't working. (Incidentally, with Norton uninstalled, all worked fine, so that was indeed the source of the problem.) Uninstalled and reinstalled Norton again, hoping to get on Explorer and get the fix before the error recurred, but now I couldn't get on the internet AT ALL. At that point, I uninstalled Norton for good. Ditto on the fact that they don't support the product, apparently don't stand behind the product, and apparently aren't very concerned about their reputation. Very disappointing. Previous versions were just fine; this is a complete mess 
 If books had a dressing contest, this one would surely take first place. It applies every imaginable gimmick for the sole purpose of impressing the reader. There are many pictures in it, all of which are sensational adolescent fantasy material, many filling a full page and sometimes in color. The text is broken up in various ways, with intervening boxes and sidebars in incosistent shapes and sizes, as if designed specifically to distract you. Its "techniques" are trademarked under the bombastic name "Emotioneering", and worst of all, the author makes a point of repeatedly flaunting his screen(game)writing prowess.  But what are these "Emotioneering" techniques? has freeman actually invented a set of technical rules which applies to drama? No, that would be Aristotle. If you're really interested in the rules of drama, that's whom you should read. What Freeman refers to as "Emotioneering" are nothing more than a pile of bad screenwrting practices you can pick up in any second rate screenwriting book - except for two differences; first, in this sorry book they are given mind-blowing names like "technique stacking" and "Emotionally Complex Moments and Situations Techniques", and second, the examples used are said to be taken "from games" instead of from films, but, of course, all of these "games" have been imagined by Freeman for the purpose of the book (which he expressly admits), because there IS no real world game that would serve his purpose - he is really talking about films.   But when it comes to films, Freeman seems to think the The Lord of the Rings trilogy is about the best you can get. Ask any amateur screenwriter and they'll tell you that the one award these films honestly deserve is Worst Screenplay. The Lord of the Rings, like Freeman's book, is all spectacle and no content.  What kept me trudging through the morass of simpleton notions and overflowing filler text was the hope that, as a man who has some experience with writing for games, Freeman would have a few words to say about the intersection of stories with interactivity - the most alluring aspect of combining games with stories. Although he doesn't take up the subject directly, he does mention at some point that writing for games is complicated by the need to accommodate for the actions of the player. He says that he uses branching statements in his scripts for this, and that this is a very tough problem. Other than that, there are some minor points like how to allow the player to experience the events of your computerized screenplay in several different orders (which is made possible only by the ridicules simplicity of the story proposed as an example), but nothing which actually deals with letting a human have a meaningful interaction with a story.   To summarize, except for the pictures (if that's your cup of tea) I really can't see any reason to buy this book over any other random heap of text. If you want spectacle, you got it. If you want knowledge, you do yourself a favor and read three books: The Poetics by Aristotle, for the real "Emotioneering" techniques, Chris Crawford on Game Design, for an understanding of why the problem is not nearly as simple as Freeman pretends it to be, and Chris Crawford on Interactive Storytelling for the best solutions to the problem currently available. 
 Jodie Foster Is one of the Greatest Actress's Ever period,but this clunky film is so boring&Predictable that it just never gets off the ground&put me to sleep. a film full of Cliches&dime a dozen story lines that never goes anywhere 
 Reading this book (until chapter six, where the book picks up somewhat), I thought to myself, "Why does my teacher hate me so? Does he find interest in learning about someone getting a bad headache from lack of coffee (which takes up an entire chapter)?" This book offers a different look at the Civil War. A boring one. Written 100 years after the Civil War ended (1968), this book set the precedent of "don't write about the Civil War if you aren't going to talk about battles, because it's boring." Read something interesting with your ever-disappearing life 
 I loved it until it broke after using it for a day.  Now when I turn it on the sound will not turn off.  If it actually worked correctly I think I would have given it a better rating 
 After reading Angela's Ashes and Tis by Frank McCourt, I was looking forward to reading more about the McCourt family's lives from the perspective of another member of the family but Malachy McCourt definitely does not have the talent of his brother, Frank. He focuses too much on himself and I could sense his ego becoming more and more inflated as the story progressed.  I'm sure he is charming and witty but an entire book by the author telling us just how charming and witty he is does get to be tiresome.  And the fact that he is so proud to be such a total scoundrel is not admirable.  I also read Malachy's book, A Monk Swimming: A Memoir, and in both books I was hoping to read more about the entire family instead 95% about Malachy himself and how pleased he is of his escapades.      The book became tiresome to read and I had to force myself to finish it 
 Having lived in Istanbul for 4 years, I was more interested in finding out more about the Byzantium history since the rest of it (post 1453); I have studied immensely through out my school years. Unfortunately, Freely did not exceed or even meet my expectations, the book was more like a tourist guide and from what I gather from the reviews, most of the people who gave it a good rating are foreigners who went to Istanbul for vacation and sightseeing..  The historical facts consist mostly of some dates and mere numbers regarding population, mosques and some prominent sultans. There was no satisfactory story telling about the life outside the palace in which it is claimed that 26 different ethnicities were living side by side. Commoners, gypsies, peasants, jugglers, tumblers, thieves, dwarves, horses, elephants were some of the inhabitants that gave Istanbul her true color.  As in several books written with a similar approach, the "harem" in the Topkapi Palace is a whole chapter by itself, yet, the entire chapter is devoted to totally irrelevant history of such and such sultan died and the son became the new sultan and then he was replaced by the next one and so on...  The only plus in this book are the sketches of some arthictectural marvels in the last pages which you do not have to buy the book to be fascinated!  
 This book proves once again, that you don't necessarily have to be a good writer to make lots of cash and sell huge quantities of books to the mass market.  "True Believer" is an all-star team of cheap, shallow cliches.  There is no plot.  No one really believes anything, and everything is a contrived, superficial mish-mash.  The dialoge has no depth, and when you've had too much dialoge, there's paragraph after paragraph of the main characters, "thinking" to themselves.  Wow, is this bad.  "Message in a Bottle" was a great plot idea, but its been a slow, steady descent since then.  You might have a good laugh at it like I did, but otherwise I was very disappointed. 
  It is completely useless book. It has many old pictures that basically useless b/s given without sequence of steps, show the old type of fabric, has a lot of general information, that you wouldn't need if you want to learn upholstery. I am sure there are better books out there. 
 If you have never read any of Sylvia Browne's book, don't start with this one. There is a lot of material in this book that refers back to other books.  
 I am sorry.. I just could not take this album. There are no hooks, nothing grabbing.. Just forlorn, dull, constantly repeated themes.. And, this has been a problem with the past few albums. It's one thing to live through tragedy and loss.. but, moaning about it over the same open chords gets old for an entire album.. There is just no closure, it seems. Look at all the great albums dealing with loss- Springsteen's "The Rising", Lou Reed's "Magic and Loss", Patti Smith's "Gone Again" and "Tramping", etc, and they all have some closure and moving on.. This doesn't.. it's like listening to some old drunk lady at the bar rattle on and on about how miserable she is, and that gets old really quick..  I see people ranting here about "Come On".. that song is by far the worst song I have heard from her.. It sounds like a reject from Steve Earle's El Corazon album.. 
 Don't purchase this if you're expecting to get a 1500 mAh  Power2000 ACD-674 battery.  They sent a 1300 mAh Digicom battery instead 
 The name of this book is very deceptive and makes it sound like it contans follow up stories in the vein of those in Deaver's book "Twisted" (which is also available in audio format). Lo and behold, it's actually just more stories taken from that book. This audio book should have been named something like "Nocuturne and other stories from Twisted". Based on other reviews I've read, I'm not the only one to have been duped. The stories in "Twisted" are good, but jeers to the publisher for pulling this fast one 
 I searched all over to find a book specifically about voodoo in New Orleans, and unfortunately this was all I could find...it's only 240ish pages and I still haven't even made it through it yet. Though there are  some interesting facts, I think it's poorly written -- and it's 50 years  old!  Would like to see a more updated version that is a better read.   Maybe will write it myself 
 Too bad there isn't a 0 star rating. This was simply awful.  I've been a Patricia Cornwell fan for years - waded though a lot of her semi-readable stuff - waiting for another decent installment.  But I give up.  No more Kaye Scarpetta for me.  This book cured me - for good 
 This hardcore conservative did not enjoy this book.  The book is filled with a wealth of eye-opening information on significant people that I did not know but should (like Hugo Chavez's new best friend, Noam Chomsky), but the reading is so laborious and draining that I cannot recommend it.  It has none of the light-hearted fun that we often get from Rush Limbaugh.  Rather, it brought to mind the dark experience of listening alone to Michael Savage in a bad mood after dark.  The cheeky title is misleading - this was a joyless book to read 
 How could anyone sit and read this boring work of fiction.  I am actually listening to the audio version and I am almost falling asleep and cannot remember a word the reader has said. I am going to stick to the movie versions of Anne of Green Gables instead of reading the rest of the books.  At least the movies keep your interest 
 This is only a portion of this episode.  It cuts off in the middle of a sentence 
 Clearly a beginner's text. Positive in that it does mention object-relational design. Can be read in a day but contents are not substantial enough in my opinion. Somewhat disappointed in Morgan Kaufmann for publishing this work. Teorey's volume I'd prefer 
 I tried to use this program to file a very simple return, and it calculated that I owed the state $550 for underpayment, as well as a $230 penalty for late payment. I tried working through the program several times to find the error. I found that the program was automatically checking boxes that I hadn't checked! I have no idea if that was the cause of the underpayment problem, which I was not able to resolve. In frustration, I went to [...] and filed my return easily within an hour, with a $140 return from the state rather than a $780 penalty 
 Breton and Villegas make the case that Latin ballplayers are exploited and then, in the overwhelming majority of cases, tossed away by major league teams.  Miguel Tejada was one of those who, it turned out, wasn't just  cheap filler for an organization's minor league chain, but instead broke  through to the majors.  This surprised the A's organization which  originally ranked him below other Dominicans who have since faded and  returned to island obscurity or the life of an undocumented alien in New  York City.  Unfortunately, the author's case is buried by some truly  stilted prose in a narrative that wanders all over the map without giving  Tejada himself much more life in the book than as a paradigm for the  author's argument.  I happen to know already a fair amount about Latin  ballplayers so this book brought me neither increased insight into them as  a group or to Tejada as an individual 
 I had never read a John Grisham book.  But I am generally a believer in the notion that "if something is hugely popular, there must be a reason for it being so."  So I assumed there was something massively entertaining about John Grisham's writing.  A week ago I picked up "The Street Lawyer," and I was prepared to be entertained.  Boy, was I wrong.  This book stinks to high heavens.  This man cannot write.  "The Street Lawyer" is badly written, stupidly plotted, and riddled with banalities and cliches.  I could go on, with great fervor, for hundreds of words, about what makes this book abysmally bad, but I'm going to save my energy.  Please, just trust me, this book is terrible.  I shudder to think that the American reading public is engrossed by this man's words 
 I ordered the book new.  It arrived with dented/chipped corners and a slightly torn spine on hardcover. I assumed it was new but slightly damaged from storage or shipping.  Three weeks into the college term I am discovering highlighting already in the book. I feel ripped off 
 I have spent a ton of money learning from the best marketers regarded in the world. This book is laughable in my humble opinion 
 This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite "white girl" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book 
 I was excited too see my very own Weil-McClain heating system pictured through-out the book. What I didn't find out is how it really worked or how to troubleshoot it. Safety is the author's first concern and first chapter  in the book. I could find nothing explaining how to correct the excess  pressure causing my safety valve to drip at times 
 I received this book as a gift to read while recovering from surgery. I plodded through the preface and first few chapters, then had to resort to skimming the rest.  I found it cumbersome and verbose -- filled with long-winded sentences, lofty and uncommon language (had to keep my dictionary at hand), and references that were entirely unknown to me. One might say it was over my head I suppose.  The best parts were her descriptions of the simple but heavenly foods she recalled from her childhood. Other than that, and her account of life in Quaker Whittier CA, I didn't find much in this memoir that I cared about. I know that her prose is highly regarded, but it was lost on me. I have not read any of her other books.    
 i was disappointed after this book was suggested to me. nothing ever happens. there are a lot of long winded descriptions and background and very little story 
 This book may be of interest to an icthyolgist, but it's not much use to a fisherman. The color illustrations are very poor. They all have a washed out yellowish tint, and thus the illustrated fish tend to look all alike. The non color illustrations are better, but the book relies mostly on descriptions 
 I agree with what Elain, another reviewer, writes below. Told through a series of letters, the novel spans Bess' life. I found this tedious and the writing unnatural, written for the readers of the novel and not for the readers of the actual letters. Bess meanders through her life, a goody-two-shoes, writing smarmy virtuous thoughts while manipulating those around her- the only element of the story that was interesting. elain wrote:   Despite rave reviews, I thought Elizabeth Forsythe Hailey's A Woman of Independent Means was a weak story. For one thing, the life of the protagonist Bess was only explored through her correspondence over the years. It is impossible to reveal a whole life through letters only. There are other nuances to a character that cannot possibly be revealed through letters; those are only what Bess chooses to write about. It's true that a life through letters gives the novel character, but also it does not expose as much as an omnicient narrator would. Also, it seems that Hailey adds dimension to her novel by introducing a string of tragedies. It is very uncommon that Bess's husband and son die within her lifetime, her house burns down, her daughter is struck by a car and later befriends a count, etc. Such events were constantly inserted into the story until it became unrealistic and maudlin. It may be true that Bess lives a life scarred by tragic events, but these happenings are so plentiful it is almost fantastical. To sum it all up, if you're interested in exploring the life of a very colorful lady, read this. But if you're looking for a novel that will leave you awed, you'd better head back to the bookshelf 
 The author needs to fact check before publishing. Gujarati is not the major language of the people who live in Mumbai. It is Marathi.   This carelessness mars the otherwise nice illustrations in this book 
 Just a rehash of the manual.  Practical Poser is a MUCH better book that really takes you through the intricacies of Poser 6.  Poser 6 Revealed basically teaches you the same the the tutorial manual does 
 Desmond, that's great, but how do you know when you're going to die 
 Dont buy this DVD!  Surrender Cinema has a unfortunate knack of claiming "Director's Cut" on it's DVDs when in fact they are no such thing. This film is rather heavily censored.  All the other reviews of this are apparently from pople who  don't realize this sad fact.  Sorry you wasted your money because many scenes/takes have been cut out of the US version, despite the fact it claims "Directors Cut".  Be weary... you're being had my friends. Sad thing is, I rate the "real" director's cut version 5 stars all the way 
 Wow. Good thing I didn't buy this book.  Looking at all these reviews there seems to be two catagories of people who rate this book.  The normal people catagory and the bling bling people who cash in on this book only to recommend their own books. And when you look at their profiles and see what books they have reviewed it's very little. It's obvious people want to cash in the name of the books ("Men are from Mars....)  One reviewer talks about his sex drive being improved then recommends his own book.  Seriously, shut up.  We live in a society where sex sells and the idea of if you want to be beautiful you have to get this book.  Don't be fooled. This book is BS and you will feel bad because another diet didn't work.  There are better diet books out there. John Gray is just trying to cash in in the weight loss craze just like Dr. Phil.  AND if you truly want to lose weight and need discipline weight watchers is great. If you are reading this you are a smart consumer don't invest in this poser, wanna be diet book. 
 As a woman (who incidentally learned to read when I was two years old), I found this book to be apalling and insulting. What the book boils down to is that  we'd be better off if we didn't read, but the evil patriarchy has imposed literacy on us so we need to know how to read, but reading is against the female nature so we're even worse off.   Please don't waste your time and money on this dreck 
 Yes this CD will put you to sleep in minutes.  Its the most boring uninspiring classical music.  The first CD was very good but this Vol. 2 is like most movie sequels....AWFUL  
 Like "Horrified" above, I was appalled by the glibness with which this book rationalized Diana's support of fascism (and Nazism). The author treats Diana and Unity's commitment to fascism as an understandable flaw (rather like a tendency to split infinitives or something), even going so far as to try to play down Mosley's politics.  As someone who has read Mosley's book, I was simply astonished at Lovell's treatment of him and Diana. Lovell mentions that people have a tendency to fall in love with Diana and forgive her everything; clearly, that's what Lovell did 
 I thought I'd love this album since I like a lot of music and everyone raves about Flogging Molly, but really I found it pretty lacking in appeal. I didn't care for the singer too much and the vibes just weren't my style apparently. I'd recommend the Dropkick Murphys a lot more than this band 
 I enjoy most all books on Autism. Everyone has a wonderful story to tell, and I love to hear what they do for their children to help them thrive. Susan seems like a wonderful mom full of courage and gusto. I did not like how the book jumps around from one point in Nats life to the next and back again. I appreciate progressing time lines. I apreciate how she accepts her son as he is. That is lovely. But knowing what I do about autism, I wish she would have done more in the way of biomedical treatments to find someunderlying causes to some of his symptoms. Some things CAN be cured with these kids-you don't just treat the symptoms-you are missing the big piture. Other things CAUSE syptoms-they are the result of something. Not everything is just chalked up to being the way the autistic brain works and that is that and there is nothing you can do but "train the child" how to act. You are cheating your child if you do not try to figure out what makes him tick from his head to his toes. maybe the Senators did this on some levels, but they did not talk about it much. They seemed to just like to medicate the problems away whenever possible. medication can be a wonderful life saving thing, but sometime you lose the real person when doing so. I know first hand-I was medicated for depression when there was an underlying phyical condition that caused it and was cured when that was addressed and taken care of. I never got the sense that they did a whole lot of digging that way-just accepting that Nat was Nat. I was left wondering what might have been for him. Maybe something a little different. Maybe not. God bless them for being so caring and accepting and strong. 
 I was surprised to find this book not only still in print, but enthusiastically reviewed by so many who obviously take it seriously.  For those willing to do a little background research into Casteneda and his subject matter it will quickly become apparent that the events detailed in 'The Teachings' did not, and could not have occurred as described.  Space prevents me going into detail here, but I have a review on my website at:  http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/redcrow/CTOMBS/Articles/Castanedax.ht 
 Although Anne made some excellent points, it was still one-sided. She still speaks of Republicans in general as being better which is wrong because many of them are just as hypocritical as Democrats (and some are worse because they know what God commands but don't actually care), and although she gives some explanations as to why Republicans are the better party, they are deceptive and wrong.  For example that Republicans are better because they promote Chrisitianity and are specific in their arguments: yes, that is true in some ways, however many promote false Christianity and make it look bad because many of them are not truly Christians but putting up a show. That needs to be said otherwise people get the impression often that all Christians are hypocrites and that it's all about financial gain or vain glory. And merely having a specific argument doesn't make an argument better. For example I can say, "Democrats are out to get your kids and the poor because they want to raise taxes on the poor and give tax cuts to the rich and want to force children to learn white wash" but so called Republicans like George Bush want to do that too and have done that.  I would like to say that this is a good book to give to a young girl, because it shows you can still be fememine, wise, and a Christian, and yet not be a fool or knowledgeable and emotionally immature (in other words a nerd), but it has too many big errors.  It's helpful howewver for everyone in general who wants to know what is wrong with some type of arguing and how to argue constructively. Although she doesn't give a thorough explanation on that subject, it's very good and concise. And I just happened to be comforted by her words because the day before had been attacked with vagueries by a pastor from an AOG church 
 This book turned out to be another release of the original book from the 1980s and it shows.  It is full of seriously outdated information and old style, pushy, boiler-room style telemarketing tactics.  Worst of all, it tells you to always push for the appointment and end the conversation there.  What about qualifying?  I can already set appointments all day if I don't bother to qualify them, but unfortunately those unqualified appointments don't buy.  Save your money and find a more up to date sales book 
 Thing was in Borders, read part - embarrassed to buy.  Ramblings of a nitwit;  absolute crud.   
 I ordered this book on March 2 and still don't have it on July 6... they now say it will be shipped in August... I'll believe it when I see it 
 The majority of this book is from the thoughts and findings of other authors.  Nothing orignal.  Books is difficult to read and often does a poor job of explaining topics clearly.  Currently using this book as a text book for a class and have to believe there is a better choice out there 
 How much of ESPN's history can Freeman botch and still publish a book? Quite a bit, it seems. An author who writes about a sports network should at least know the difference between various leagues, especially the difference between major and minor leagues and which teams are in which 
 The Curse disc is perfect, I will say that but The Gift can be used for the following things, other than listening purposes... 1. Frisby 2. Mirror 3. Toilet paper 4. Shooting target 5. Tras 
 If your intent is to be a scholar of Shakespeare, you may enjoy this book.  However, if you enjoy the literature attributed to Mr. Shakespeare, spend your valuable time reading "his" works.  I was seduced into buying this book by a review that painted a rather incomplete picture of the true nature of the contents.  I have struggled thru 3 chapters of pedantry, as this group of scholars argue over minutiae like the context and validity of the phrase "precious instance". ("Nature is fine in love and where 'tis fine It sends some precious instance of itself after the thing it loves")  Go to the library, read from a few chapters and then make your decision on whether to buy this book or "As You Like It" 
 Ordered this item on Sept 28. They were supposed to ship it within 1 week. After 1 week I received an email, they said they needed 2 more weeks. Another email today (Nov 7), they think they can deliver it by November 27. That's 2 months after I placed my order. At this point, I am not even sure if they can delivered this item by the end of the year. Fortunately with Amazon, they do not process the payment unless the items are shipped and they give you the option to cancel the order, which is what I am going to do right now 
 I think this book was okay. There were some funny parts, and I have to say that I did grow to like and admire Chris. But all in all, I was dissapointed. It was boring and I am one of those reviewers that didn't like the style he wrote it in. He was repeatative, like when he mentioned a million times about his and his moms tempure. I would love to have a reading with him and would never question his abilities, but it just wasn't a really good book 
 OK so this book was written in 1991, but were women still that far behind then??  I trudged thru this book.  It was drivel.  A 25 y.o. woman heading a corporation the size that it was??? Yikes, run for the hills.  This girl loved the abusive relationship she had to begin with then found a millionaire who took her in and trained HER to run his Corp?   Puleeze, even giving the benefit of the doubt, I would not believe this!    And Cy, well, he should have imploded right after he and his mother ran Meredith out of town.  What a non-redeeming man he was and then at the end he 'saw the light'.    This was a first Diana Palmer that I read, and I dont know if I can stand reading another one.  I cant wait to give this back to my neighbor and wonder why she would buy a book this bad 
 The authors speak of real problems, but address them ineffectively.  By peddling generalizations of the white race, they perpetuate the victim/victimizer dichotomy which divides instead of uniting.  Further, the boundary between victim and victimizer is drawn rigidly along racial lines.  They fail to recognize that any progress has been made in the decades since the civil war toward a more loving, color blind society.  This truly dishonors the memory of those whose blood and tears watered the garden from which African Americans now harvest financial and educational opportunities as well as self worth.  A better discussion, in my opinion, can be found in Joel Kovel's book by the same title 
 When I picked up this book, I figured that the title,  "The Non-Designer's Type Book," meant that it was a book about type, FOR non-designers.  After reading it, from cover to cover, I now wonder if the title refers to the author's credentials rather than the book's target audience. I love typography. I sit in theaters and watch every minute of the rolling credits if the font used is well chosen and well displayed.  I have a Caslon 540 lower-case "g" pinned to the wall above my Mac instead of swimsuit pics. If you love type, you know what I'm talking about. If you love type, avoid this book and do not recommend it to anyone who hopes to someday love typography and master its use.  Robin Williams' cutesy and heavy-handed text, while sometimes informative, is loaded with irritating "insights" as well as written-in-stone directives that are passed off as law. For instance, in at least two places, she states that type should NEVER, EVER be underlined. She says that it's a "law" that should "never" be broken. C'mon Robin! I mean yes, underlining is very often misused, but have you looked at the latest PRINT or CA Annual? There is a time and a place for underlining and the sensitive, savvy designer knows when and how to do it. She outright trashes one of the most elegantly designed faces in the history of the printed word, Helvetica, and glibly states that it will be out of style for the "next two hundred years." What?? Again, has Ms. Williams even looked at what contemporary (and effective) designers are doing these days? Helvetica is alive and flourishing. And, at the same time she is trashing Helvetica, she calls "rendered" type (such as 3D effects, letters that appear to be chiseled from stone or made of, say, salad greens) typography's "most beautiful" trend. She's killin' me!!  If you want to fulfill and expand your appreciation for typography, buy Robert Bringhurst's exquisite manual, The Elements of Typographic Style 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 i never recieved this item . so i cant review it . id like it sent i vaguely remeber ordering it . so if i its on backorder or ill be recieving it soon let me know please .   thanks  
 I thought this book was dull and disappointing.  If you are looking for just a bit of light reading for the sake of a story, this may be the book for you - but if you are looking for a novel that is intriguing, moving and involving, this certainly didn't make the grade for me.  The writing is dull, the characters are flat, the plot moves along like a simplistic fantasy with the characters making their choices with an unrealistically shallow level of conflict.  I personally found I was unable to empathise with any of them because I felt they just weren't real to me, despite the book's issues being quite close to my heart.  It's magazine-rack stuff 
 These are either the tracks that were destined to be shelved & never see the light of day. No consistency whatsoever. One star because there's no 0 star option!! 
 As an Atlanta resident, I have read all the newspaper accounts of the grizzly Tokars murder... how dare Ms Trochek take credit & pretend that this is fiction!  This was 100% about the Tokars murder, she just changed  the names. She lost all of my respect, she showed a tremendous lack of  imagination in her plot and character development, all the characters and  events were straight out of the newspapers. We all knew exactly who did it,  why, and how...because the newspapers had already told that story. Shame on  you Ms Trochek 
 I had this disc pre-ordered and was quite excited for it. Than unfortunately I found out that it is missing almost 3 to 4 hours worth of extra bonus material.  I am sick of getting less for paying more... Yeah the picture quality and sound is better but not by much when I play a reqular dvd in my upconvert dvd player.  I think I will go order the regular dvd of this set... What a disappointment.. Thank goodness I found out about the extras not being there and had time to cancell my order YodaBud 
 This was beyond disappointing.  I'd been waiting for Mia's story and expected so much more.  This read like one of Ms. Mallery's Silhouette Special Edition books that she tried to lengthen to single-title word count and filled with absurdities.  Mia in previous books was likable... in this one, not likable at all.  The storyline was ridiculous, far-fetched, and yet in parts beyond cliched.  Not one of Ms. Mallery's best works.  
 "How Greek Philosophy Corrupted The Christian Concept of God" is nothing more than the regurgitation of Mormon doctrinal beliefs under the guise of historical investigation, much in the same sense that The 7-Habits of Highly Effective People (written by Mormon, Stephen Covey) was nothing more than Mormon doctrine written under the guise of how to develop effective leadership.  Hopkins is a former trial attorney, missionary for the Latter-day Saint (LDS) Church, and has held many prominent offices in the Mormon Church.  What starts out as a book intended to show the effects of Hellenism upon traditional Christian theology, turns into a pitch for Mormonism as being the answer to undo what Hellenism supposedly did.    This book is not well-written, theologically speaking, as it merely repeats many of the same arguments that LDS leadership have been asserting the past 150+ years to try and convince those willing to listen, that there just might be something in Mormonism that might be true.  A "classic" example of this is found on pages 357-8 of Hopkins' book, where he attempts to convince the reader that there might have been a time when God was not.  Hopkins writes,       Classical theists have had great difficulty explaining the incarnation of Christ and the passage in Philippians noted above [2:5-7].  But that is only the icy tip of their dilemma.  The Bible does not support the notion that Christ has always been a member of the Godhead.  That notion is as unbiblical as the Greek notions mentioned above.  It is contradicted in both the Old and New Testaments.  While many passages teach that God "has always existed...throughout all eternity," no passage teaches what Dr. [Francis] Beckwith claims-that God (and specifically God the Son), "has always existed as God throughout all eternity."  What then does the Bible say about the length of time during which God the Son has been "God," i.e. a member of the Godhead?"  It is comments like the above which permeate Hopkins' attempt at supposedly providing an objective look at the historical development of Christian doctrine.  Unfortunately, his Mormon view is so tainted with the very Hellenism he hopes to expose, that he fails, miserably, in providing either an historically accurate, or theologically sound, representation of just what Christians believe.  After all, Hopkins is hoping, himself, to become a god one day, which is perhaps the epitome of Hellenistic thought; man becoming a god.  If one truly desired to get a taste of the effects of Greek thought upon Christian doctrine, he would do himself a favor by looking into either Ron Nash's "Christianity & the Hellenistic World," or Everett Ferguson's "Background of Early Christianity."  Both supply ample evidence and documentation that just because Christianity grew up amid Hellenistic thought and culture does not necessarily mean that it merely mimicked its environment.  Dr. Edwin Yamauchi, History Professor at Miami (Ohio) University writes of Nash's book, "Professor Nash has written a lucid and superb book, which will prove especially useful to students in colleges and universities who still hear some ill-founded comparisons between the pagan mystery  religions and Christianity from their professors."  The Biblical Archeologist writes of Ferguson's book, "An impressive achievement in both scope and execution....Its strengths are its comprehensiveness and its very valuable bibliographical resources."    In conclusion, it is no overstatement to assert that Richard Hopkins' book is a book about the propagation of Mormonism.  Although it contains allusions and statements from Christian leaders down through the centuries, those same allusions and statements are given in a context designed to get the reader to consider Mormonism as true; that it is the restoration of what Hellenism supposedly took away.  Fortunately, though, Mormonism is not true, and neither is the premise of Hopkins' book, that Hellenism essentially corrupted everything that Christianity represents 
 I am thrilled to see an africana-american discuss the failings of other african-americans (like the way Elder can dismiss Bill Cosby and Will Smith's ridiculous thoughts on aids or Whoopie Goldberg's illogic on Hollywood and blacks). Unfortunately he is still a little too pro-black in his own thoughts, what's the sense of being an individual on some things and not everything? He shows his overly pro-black bit in things like when discussing Sharon Stone and gun-control and then talking about a poor black worker who can't afford a gun for protection. Why didn't he just mention a poor worker who can't afford a gun for protection and totally leave out this person's race? It would have been better if he drifted completely off the african-american subject after his impressive individual opening and rather correct stand on them. But no no matter what topic Elder is on african-americans are never far away. Also, he didn't seem to mention that blacks wre only what 12% of the USA's population in his early chapters. Lastly, Elder----Henry Kissenger is Jewish, you have him listed as German-american. A Jewish person is a Jew first and a member of their country second (unless the country's Israel).  
 My GPS is an eXplorist XL.  I assume the guts are the same, so here goes.  I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am with this Magellan GPS.  I have been an exclusive Magellan user since 1999, but am now officially fed up. Customer Support:  Lack of.  Magellan simply has the worst possible record responding to requests for support.  When you call, after being on hold for hours, the person on the phone is clue free.  The Web site is inpentrable.  When you can't get on the site for any reason.  Or when you can't download something, there is no clue as to why.  By trial and error I have discoverd you have to turn off ANY firewall, and set your Explorer preferences to accept all cookies.  New firmware upload.  It corrected nothing I cared about, and completely messed up the Geocaching Manager capability.  When I upload Geocaches the machine arbitrarily drops several ... but you have no idea beforehand which are dropped.  Paperless system: With the memory card (I have 1GB, you should be able to store thousands of Geocaches and ALL the associated text.  Nope.  You get the name and a few items off the Geocache page.  Clues over a few words are truncated.  The "beeper" is misleading.  It beeps whether you have done what you wanted or not.  Example:  I want to edit some coordinates on a marked fix.  I use the joy stick to move from number to number.  The GPS beeps whether the move was made or not.  The beep is independent of the desired result.  When you push the joystick you get a beep whether or not an edit was made. A ver annoying feature.  When you do a Go To on a Point of Interest, you cannot see the icon on the compass page.  It is too small.  It needs to be White and larger.  Now it looks too much like the Sun icon.  On a Go To the "compass needle" need to point to the destinaiton instead of North.  This option needs to at least be selectable.  You need to be able to put yourself at the bottom of the screen so you can see more of what's coming up.  I don't care much about what's behind me...this needs to be a selectable option.  Reliability:  A friend teaches GPS at the College level.  After 6 years with Magellan he recently moved to Garmin due to poor reliabiliity of the receivers.  His experience in large classes was a return rate nearing 40%  Good things.  The XL is very rugged.  I have dropped it on rocks from "too high" and it has survived well.  The color screen is large and easy to read.  Verdict:  Get something else.   
 "Hands of a Murderer" was the first Sherlock Holmes adaptation I ever saw (though oddly, it was titled "Sherlock Holmes and the Prince of Crime"). Being around 12 years old at the time, I considered it to be just about the greatest thing ever put on film. Time has jaded me, however, because now I see it as a rather goofy and unimpressive entry. The storyline is decent enough: the evil Professor Moriarty desperately wants to get his hands on a secret code that Holmes' brother Mycroft is protecting. However, it is all carried out with quite a bit of camp. Edward Woodward (Sherlock Holmes) is clearly too old for the role, and, quite frankly, does not much resemble the tall, lean figure of the stories. In addition, he seems to spend much of the film in an oddly grumpy mood, as if he were disturbed from a nap in between takes. John Hillerman's Watson fares little better, delivering his lines in a dreary, sombulent tone. Anthony Andrews (side note: see "The Scarlet Pimpernel" for a GREAT performance) is the only saving grace, and makes a  believeable Moriarty, though perhaps a touch too young.   Despite its weaknesses, this film is fun to watch on a lazy or rainy afternoon, and is recommended for collectors of Sherlockiana and/or Holmes on screen. Two stars out of five 
   I purchased this album when it came out, I listened to it once and threw it in the garbage afterwards. It was that bad!!!   It didnt have any of the catchy riffs of the earlier misfits. And the drums!...the drums of the old misfits gave it a unique sound...and this one! It was second-rate heavy metal/thrash drumming. This album was a terrible,terrible disappointment. I could not believe I spent my money on this album. It is a lame,sad and pathetic attempt at resurrecting the glory of the old misfits.....this album and the ones after this, proves this to be true. 
 I read this book several years ago.  Just recently, I read Anthony Robbin's Unlimited Power.  If you're choosing between Awaken the Giant Within and Unlimited Power, definitely go with Unlimited Power.  Don't bother with this book.   
 Jon Bon Jovi should definitely stick to singing because he's a horrible actor, but that does not even begin to describe how terrible "Vampires- Los Muertos" is...as horrible of an actor as Jon Bon Jovi may be, "Vampires-Los Muertos" is an even worse movie.  Vampires, that's a laugh...this movie has a terrible plot and the acting is even worse.  The original "Vampires" sucked too, but this one is even worse folks!  Definitely one of the worst so called "horror" movies of all-time and that my friends is saying something!!  Can you believe some people call this a horror movie...well, you can imagine what I call it...yes sir, I just call it rubbish and that's being very kind. 
 The Astronaut's Wife, starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron was a major disappointment. My husband and I have what we call the 30-Minute Rule when it comes to watching DVD's. Since our spare time is so limited, if we are not completely engrossed in the movie at the end of 30 minutes, we stop and put something else on.  I'm sorry to say that The Astronaut's Wife did not make it past the 30-Minute rule. In fact, I found myself watching the timer, wishing the minutes would go by faster so we could find a better way to waste our time.  The first thing is, the movie is slow. Very, very, very slow. There are lots of camera angles on Charlize Theron looking thoughtful, Charlize looking pensive, Charlize looking worried, Charlize looking scared, Charlize looking sad- well, you get the idea. Everything seems to happen as though we are watching it through a very long tunnel-- noises are slightly muted and have an "out-of-body" sound to them.  Even Johnny Depp is not enough to save this movie. The feeling I generally get when watching Johnny Depp in a role is that nobody else could have played that part because he makes it so much his own. In this instance, however, I can think of a dozen different actors who could have played the part, and we wouldn't have noticed the difference.  If you must watch it, put it on fast forward and read the subtitles. That way you'll get it over with faster. 
 I have never read any of Hoffman's books and only bought this one because it was a "highly recommended" read at my local bookstore.  This book is awful to say the least and I don't understand how it can get such high praise.  The first thing that bothers me about it is Hoffman seems to be romanticizing being a homeless and aimless drifter.  The main characters Matt and Edmund are exactly that.  Matt "asks" houses and other places if she can stay in them, there is a word for that it is called squatting or trespassing and it is illegal.  She gets her food out of dumpsters. Matt apparently got her powers after too much drinking and drugs, interesting message there, be a homeless drug addict/alcoholic and get the power to talk to inanimate objects.  Hoffman refers to the garbage bag Matt has her property in as her luggage.  Give me a break.  The story itself doesn't flow well and goes off in weird directions.  Matt and Edmund visit his sister and find this wild magic lying around and his sister and her family just accept it and are all OK with it.  They finally meet up with Susan, totally blow apart her carefully constructed world and she blows off her job and her carefully put together life without a second thought and goes off with someone she doesn't know (Matt) and someone she hasn't seen in over 10 years (Edmund).  That makes absolutely no sense.   I will not be reading anything else by Hoffman 
 Although the book is very interesting, it really didn't have in it what I thought would be in it.  I actually bought the book for my husband, who is into model rocketry and is making his own rocket engines and I thought this book would be informative enough to teach him to make the black powder that goes in them.  Well, it is...if you have ten years to wait for everything to cure and get to a point where it's "good" enough to use for black powder.  I really did think he could put the knowledge he gained there to work immediately and therefore I was disappointed in the content of the book.  If you have ten years to wait for everything to come together then this is a book for you.  If you want to put the knowledge to work for you right away, forget it 
 The concept of the unit is that you can use your house wiring as the carrier for the signal. The problem with the design is that it cannot overcome the physics of electricity. Netgear does not clearly explain that you cannot push the signal past the homes breaker system in their ads and hence the only way this system works is if your router is on the same circuit as the adapter. New homes break up room/equipment loads into smaller circuits for safety virtually stopping the use of a system like this. My complaint for netgear is that this is not put out there as a significant technical consideration. Although I continued to use their router I had to go wireless to make the system work and wasted money and time getting to the solution 
 "Chamber" was always the worst entry in the Harry Potter series, but this film adaptation manages to take what was already a crappy story and make it even worse. Choppy editing, horrible humor personified by the untalented Rupert Grint, smug acting by the equally untalented Emma Watson, poor screenwriting by that hack Steve Kloves and incompetent direction by the other hack Chris Columbus makes this a very unpleasant experience.   Skip it if you can. 
 I have never written a review, but in this case, I feel compelled to do so. I purchased the iMonitor last week as an upgrade to a Safety 1st dual monitor, for no other reason than I was tired of the interference. I was excited to learn of the digital technology, and once I got it home, I was anxious to try it. After a few nights trying it out, I was equally as anxious to return it and get my money back...let me explain: To begin with, before you buy, please be aware that the lights and sound are awfully bright and loud, which was troublesome since I am a light sleeper. I would have been able to deal with it, but there are other problems as well...there are 'clicks' and 'crackles' that are intermittent, and, like I said before, not good for a light sleeper.  The final straw was on the fourth night the parent receivers lost contact with the base -- I spent a half hour resetting it, reconfiguring the layout, powering on/off -- all to no avail. It kept beeping 'Out of Range' -- I was only 10 feet from the monitor at the time. Absolutely unacceptable.  In all fairness, we do have a lot of gadgets that are wireless and may have been competing with the monitor, but that isn't an excuse..it says 'Crystal Clear Clarity' and '2000 foot range', but this is not, I repeat, NOT the case. So, I packed it back up and went into Babies R Us to return it...here's the kicker: The salesperson at the store said that she agreed they had a lot of problems and she has seen more of the iMonitors returned than any other monitor. She rec'd the Sony, but it doesn't come with two parent units, so I have resigned myself to living with the Safety 1st..even with all of its interference, it is still superior, and 1/4 of the price as the iMonitor.  I have no doubt that Digital is the next step in baby monitors...but so far Graco does not have it figured out...Save your money and give it some time so they can work out the obvious flaws in the system. 
 Great looking beans.  Unfortunately, the packages are also full of drug store beetles, a common pantry pest.  I could see them as soon as I opened the box.  Why did they not catch this at Bob's Red Mill 
 Reader unfriendly, tedious. Not recommended as a text for individuals entering the field 
 Zero stars, for a product not yet out. (5 for a great series though)While a few of the initial reviews, or should I say PREviews listing episodes, are informative, none of these writings here really do me, or most consumers any good, SINCE THIS ITEM HAS NOT YET BEEN RELEASED! Amazon does the average consumer a disservice in printing these glowing, drooling reviews before we have seen the product - quality, the ACTUAL episodes released, packaging, possible defects (like the Magnum series & Maiden's last Live DVD, both featured defective sections...) when the product IS released, I will have to wade through 7 (as of Oct 3) B.S. PRE-views in order in order to gain actual product knowledge before buying... These PRE'S, are presented by: fans? Industry Sales schmucks? Amazon employees? Who knows, pre-buyer beware...   
 This movie is simply an offensive, unreal and exploitative movie made by a Cheap Tarantino rip off, who didn't hesitate to sell out his country culture to get a shameful pass to Hollywood..  Jakubowikz is even lower than the characters depicted in his awful piece of cinematic dung.   It portraits Caracas (and Latin America by rebound) as a horrible hellhole of drugs, street violence and utterly corrupt cops with nothing redeeming, not a trace of law and order at all.   The stupid, unreal kidnappers depicted here justify their actions by pointing out that most of the country is starving, like it were an excuse to commit crime and behave sadistically.   "Gangsta" Robin Hoods, what an original idea !!  this abomination is full of cheap cliches and unreal charaters:  1.- A middle Class "Social Justice warrior" street lowlife with a "heart of gold" , associated with   2.- Two little-better-than-animals, sadistic "ghetto-Gangsta" insufferable stereotypes.  3.- The "poor little rich girl" who volunteers at a public clinic and loves the "poor and the pauper" but also likes to party wildly, swallow tons of pills and several other drugs (a cross between Mother Theresa and Sid Vicious) AND is deeply in love and ENGAGED with    4.- The incredibly shallow , insensitive, inhuman, unmoral, cocaine-loving, unlikable, stupid antipathetic upper class boyfriend.  there's some unreal and exploitative subplots (is there a plot?) and situations:  After a five year loving relationship and in a matter of few hours, Martin, the creepy Boyfriend:   1.- Goes "out of the closet" and, in a hateful and Homophobic manner, he sodomizes (and enjoys it!!)  a gay drug dealer who just saved his life (and who happens to be an old friend!!) in a middle of a death threatening situation, with his five-year-relationship-sweetheart fiancee left alone with the lowlifes.  2.-After being caught in the middle of the despicable Homo act , The creepy boyfriend is RIDICULED by his own loving girlfriend, who joins the three thugs in the mocking and a small drug party, like they were old, good  friends!!  3.- After a five year loving relationship, He doesn't hesitate to abandon his fiancee in the hands of the thugs at the first opportunity he has to escape.  4.- There are the thousand of taxis in Caracas, but He chose to escape precisely the one the thug's accomplice is driving.  What a coincidence.  5.- Absolutely all the Police force in Venezuela is utter corrupt, even worse than the criminals. And the military are all gays.   I wonder how Venezuela still exists.  The acting (and the screenplay) of this cinematic excrement consists in point guns to a head, make rape and executions threats, insults, beat and be beaten and an individual and extraordinary effort to be as unlikable as possible.  The embarrasing Ruben Blades cameo is totally forgettable.    This movie IS NOT a socio-political drama and , despite the film's pretentions to social relevance, there is nothing to be learned here and no pleasure to be had.   Just a very bad, derivative,  sensationalistic, exploitative and utter low piece of crap.  And you, latinamericans, should be ashamed to glorify and give positive reviews to this low, offensive monstruosity.  My rate Is not ONE out of five, actually is ZERO Stars out of five. Less than zero 
 Bells Are Ringing had everything going for it. A good lead actress, repmise, plot, screenplay, and well-written lyrics. But the way that these were used where some of the worst ways you'd ever imagine. The 2001 revival recording of this is 100 times better, and Faith prince does so much better then Judy Holliday. This CD has some things that still work, like the screenplay and lyrics, but as a recording, this is just plain dull 
 Like my topic says, be sure you know what you buy. Robinson is giving details on how the book was found, compiled, traded, stolen and so fourth around the world. He goes into why it has been covered up for so long, instead of actually getting into what is written in the Gospel of Judas. If you want to know the History of this Gospel, and why it took so long to surface into the public eye, then I highly recommend this book. However, if your looking into the Gospel of Judas itself, what it says, and it's meanings, I would advise a different book 
 Just when I thought she couldn't get any worse, she managed to massacre Christmas songs... completely massacre.  Reminds me of the stench Britney left behind when she remade Sonny &Cher's "And The Beat Goes On" & Madonna's remake of "American Pie".  Leave the originals alone, guys... these are bland & horrible.. 
 I will never ever recommend this author. She may claim to be a Christian, but her behavior is anything but. This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian "love". I want to go wash my hands in lysol. It is because of attitudes like hers that Christians like me are portrayed as a bunch of whacko nutjobs 
 In the begginning i was impressed by the title but disappointed by the quality of its material besides the font is very bad and hard to read , very small sketches hard to see , and the ideas exploration is not accomplished ,so never start with this book for this subject ... 
 This is, without a doubt, the worst investment I have made so far.  The grammar and punctuation is deplorable, and the information is next to useless.  There are infinitely better sources for anyone looking for information on how to start a small business.  I would have given it a rating of less than one star had one been available.  Save your time and money 
 It's quite interesting when people describe this book as groundbreaking in learning sight seeing music.  I didn't feel the same way.  I understand that there are probably worse books, but this one reminded me my old musical school- I could play accordion but I never learned how to read notes.  This book didn't help much as well.  It's written in uninteresting manner in kind of boring monotony.  I would recommend books of Bruce Arnold on that particular subject, or any musical subject.  Quiet unorthodox teaching.  This book, on the other hand, just....disappointing.  I sent it back.    
 Worst band to ever come out of the hardcore scene and pretty much the death knell of melodic-hardcore in the 90s. After these soft Weezer wannabe charlatans it was all downhill. It's baffling how Jade Tree went from releasing the Swiz discography to putting out these guys.  These guys are only notable for having a split 7" with the far superior Texas Is The Reason. Buy the self titled Texas Is The Reason ep on Revelation instead and live your life in hapiness knowing you have the one truely great release which came outta that whole sub-scene 
 A good talent as evidence such as No More Tears tells you, Zakk Wylde is a wasted solo artist constantly ripping his own music, creating average album after average album without a break (one every year) and talking smack about everyone but Drozzy. His fake biker persona and tough-guy exterior only veils his insecurities as a guitarist and his creative bankruptcy.   On Mafia, which I had some hopes for since the 3-star Blessed Hell Ride truly dissapoints. Suicide Messiah with its catchy riffing and chorus pulled me into getting this crap that even Zakk will not listen to in the years to come. Then you have In This River, a so-called tribute to the Mighty Dimebag. Zakk as everyone noticed made a great name during and after Dimebag sad and untimely death by repeatedly talking about how close he was to the Great Southern Trendkiller. Then you can expect the mandatory tribute song with utterly cheesy, classless and stupid In This River. Wish it was Dime who makes it to the other end of the river!  If Zakk stops concentrating on bitching about other artists, throwing eggs at legends and singing like a wannabe Ozzy, perhaps he can make some good music in the future.  
 I have read several of Hiaasen's books and loved them.  They were very funny.  This one is not.  It is an endless description of naked strippers.  I found the main character, Erin, to be very unappealing.  She is just so stupid.  Her problems are all of her own creation.  And she is not funny.  I think you have to be a man to like this book.  I, as a woman, just found it exceedingly boring.  I kept waiting for it to get funny.  It never did 
 Celia Vallerand is aboard a ship sailing from France to New Orleans with her new husband when they are attached by pirates.  After killing her husband, the leader, Dominic Legare, takes Celia as a prize for his beloved brother.  The exchange will never take place if Captain Griffin, another pirate, has anything to say about it.  After Celia confesses to him that she is a Vallerand and he will be compensated well for her safe return, Griffin takes matters into his own hands to save this innocent bride.  What ensues is a tale that tells of pirates, life on a plantation, and how a puritanical virgin can set her pride aside to find true love.  Okay, first of all, I have to agree that the idea of her being a virgin even though she's married is foolish and just a bit too easy.  I would have expected more from Kleypas, but then they can't all be winners.  I liked that Griffin's character stayed roughly the same throughout the entire novel. Yes he's demanding, overbearing, loudmouthed and obnoxious, but at least he's consistent.  It's not like he's forcing her into bed one minute and then apologizing the next.  I can respect that the characters at least didn't change halfway through the novel to make them more likeable.  And believe me I didn't like them.  Oh well, Kleypas has given me some lovely gems before in the form of Suddenly You and Lady Sophia's Lover.  I can forgive her for this one 
 The first Nora Roberts novel I read was Northern Lights, and I was pleasantly surprised by the strong sense of locale, interesting and believable characters, and a well-crafted and exciting plot.  Angels Fall sounded like it would follow in the same genre, but it is more a gushy romance novel than a thriller.  This time the hick town location is cliched and dull, as are the characters (especially the heroine).  I started this book on a ten-hour plane trip, and put it down after a couple hours.  A month later I'm still only half way through it; in the last ten chapters not much has happened.  
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 My 3yr. old loves My Little Pony, so I bought this DVD...She asked me to turn it off because it was scary. I also, was disapointed when I got it in the mail and saw that it was made in 1986 and on the descrition it said 2006.   
 If you are looking to obtain a basic knowlege of web programming, then this is not the book for you. I wanted a basic guide, but the author managed to create a book that is TOO basic. Yes, I was able to get my first website up on the internet, but it doesn't DO anything. For that, I'll need to buy another book. 
 this unit is amazingly heavy given that it is mostly mesh. The poles are not super high quality and I would imagine are going to break is used a lot. I used this in some high winds and the zippers broke. 
 Not what I was expecting. Very hard to read as it was written back in the dark ages and the english used is tough 
 Anyone interested in finding out about the real nature of biological diversity should read " The Structure of Evolutionary Theory" by Stephen Jay Gould 
 Aside from Tatum's whining about every game the Raiders lost, and his incessant bad-mouthing of the Pittsburgh Steelers of the 70's, I actually enjoyed Tatum's first book, "They Call Me Assassin".  Tatum's second book, "They Still Call Me Assassin", was almost an exact reprint of the first book, except it included a few more of Tatum's self-serving rants that would interest no one outside of Tatum's immediate family.  Now, in this third installment, we are given exact reprints of both books.  Amazingly, the reprinted portions of "They Call me Assassin" that were in "They Still Call Me Assassin" are left in "Final Confessions", so much of the reprinted material in "Final Confessions" appears twice in the book!  The actual `new' material takes up a whole 12 pages in the 348 page fiasco.  Don't waste your money now, simply wait until the fourth Tatum book appears on the market, "I Still Have Final Confessions", and has the exact reprints of volumes 1-3 
 I was hoping this book would provide easy to ready clear answers to questions regarding Catholicism and the meaning of the mass.  To me it was like reading a sermon with too much explanation into the history of each part of the mass.  I was looking more for a quick reference and explanation of why certain things are done are certain times during the mass,,,kind of like a Catholic 101 or Catholic for Dummies book.   
 From and anonymous reveiw printed in the "British Critic" for July 1824 on Hogg's "Confessions": "There are three good reasons for reading books: first to be instructed by them; secondly to be amused; and thridly, to review them. The first does not apply at all to the tale befor us; as to the second, there are but few whose taste it will suit...;the third carried us through with that proud conciousness of martrydom for the public good, to which we are but too much accustomed when labouring in our vocation." 
 I have made it through two chapters, and already I have discovered two major factual errors.  First, on page 7 neck extensors are described as innervated by the ventral cervical rami when, in fact, they are innervated by the dorsal cervical rami.  This error is repeated in Chapter 1, table 2.  Second, on page 31, the O'Brien test interpretation is described exactly opposite of the original description by O'Brien.  A SLAP lesion gives pain in the pronated position, not the supinated position as described.  Read with caution 
 The original Julie and Romeo was delightful. This book was utter nonsense.  A great disapointment. Finished reading it only to find out if it might get better as you went along. It Didn't 
 I love Scott Turow ... have loved everything he has written.  What happened on this one?  I'm a veracious reader; read everything in this genre.  This is, perhaps, the worst book I've ever read.  I threw it out after I finished to be sure nobody else picked it up and wasted their time 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 If I could give this book zero stars, I would do so. There's barely a plot: the protagonist, Janie, marries three men and kills the last one because he gets rabies. The end. Janie is the ultimate antiheroin. She comes off as this oppressed little wife who takes forever to speak out against her husbands. It would have been better if Alice Walker had not "found" Zora Hurston and brought this awful book back into the public. 
 I realize that 'ruined my life' may be a bit harsh, but I'll tell you why this is true for me.  I read this book and decided that I too, would feel great and look great just like Suzanne, I would go on bio-identical hormones.  That was 2 years ago.  Since then, I have lost almost 40% of my hair due to the fact that replacing hormones is not an exact science.  The doctor that treated me added testosterone to my hormone mix, and this in turn began making my hair fall out after about 4-5 months. I was told to 'be patient', that it would 'normalize'.  I later found out testosterone is the absolute worst thing that some people can take, and now, 2 years later, I am in hell because of this book.  I can't believe how stupid I was 
 Oh my God!!! Do not waste your time watching this awful movie with which has an even more awful cast...I think that one star is really pushing it as the film was so bad that I switched it off less than half way through.  I am a great boxing fan and would normally love to watch any movie, BUT, I draw the line when the movie is so bad that you actually wish that you hadn't wasted your time watching it and would rather go to the denstist and have all your teeth removed with the use of acid (and that is without painkillers)... An awful movie that is not even worth a star - I just wish that it could be given a minus number it is honestly that bad!! 
 Arnold Snyder has some interesting ideas as a gambling writer, but this new offering is a little disappointing.  The author explains how to make money from casino and poker bonuses. Basically, his method involves signing up with an internet casino, taking any bonus they have, then cashing out.   The trouble is that online gambling is illegal in most of the United States. If you could make hundreds of thousands of dollars doing this then it might be worthwhile, but as Snyder seems to admit, getting the money is really hard. Getting money out of an e-casino, judging by the problems Snyder's mentions, is not easy, they are very reluctant to pay up, many simply will take your money knowing you can't take them to court. Some will cheat: it is very easy to write a computer program which fixes the odds against you.  Even with honest e-casinos, you often have to wager eighty times the bonus or more before they will let you keep it!! You would end up losing your money most of the time!! Imagine trying to get a $100 bonus, having to wager $8000, and losing $600 or $700. It does happen!  If you check out the author's website, you see why he is promoting e-casinos-his site gets lots of money from links to internet casinos and he gets a percentage of the losses of people who go through those links. I think that is why he is recommending this type of "advantage play" rather than something respectable like card-counting.  Nevertheless, he does cover some of the common problems you face online in some detail. And, the section on poker is a good basic primer, if you like playing poker.  
 The content of the book is good and my 2-year-old son enjoyed the book a lot. Unfortunately the paper is of low strength and is not up to the hard use that young users can dish out 
 I never thought the music of Charles Mingus could be made to sound so unemotional.  The performance is lifeless compared to any of the originals.  Wynton Marsalis's latest effort to score a historical piece for an orchestra again fails.  As with Coltrane's A Love Supreme, the original small group performance set the bar very high.    That is not to say that any attempt to score these works is a guarenteed failure (see many recordings by the Mingus Big Band).  The reason these works fail along with many other of Marsalis's are due to a lact of emotional fire, and originality (the artist must at least attempt to provide some personal statement to the piece, or all you can to is compare it to the original).           
 Having read All the Pretty Horses, Blood Meridian, and now The Crossing, I feel a little compelled to comment.  I got through 3 of McCarthy's books because the writing technique is very good. The imagery of the desert and of survival is well done and vivid, and makes the flaws in the narrative easier to take, but in retrospect, this book was awful.  The book should have been titled The Crossings, because the protagonist puts himself through the hell of journeying into Mexico three times, each time for a less compelling reason. I almost expected he'd make a fourth trip because he forgot to turn off the stove. Each trip requires an extensive cataloging of the trials and tribulations of the journey, and while McCarthy's writing is good, it's not so good that tedium is avoided in the repeated trips.  The 3 books I mentioned above all share a morbid fascination with Mexico. McCarthy is like one of those moralists who go on and on about the decadence of pop culture, until you start to wonder whether prurience is really the motive for their obsession. For McCarthy, Mexico is the land where the upright, brave and resourceful gringo confronts human weakness and cruelty, slumming among the brown people who either offer him tributes of food, or test his manly mettle with their perfidy. Referring to Mexico as a "negligible republic", and comments about being "nigger-rich" make McCarthy seem like the typically complacent and hypocritical citizen of a country that relies on the misery of others for its comforts and stability. A McCarthy novel would look right at home in the pocket of a Ralph Lauren model.  Another tendency of McCarthy: extended pseudo-philosophical monologues by wizened codgers. The pathetic thing is that the protagonist's response to these windy metaphysics is usually, "Uh huh. Well, gotta move long now."  If you have to read McCarthy, read Blood Meridian, and plan on skimming 
 One of the most unfair treatments of the demise of Eastern Airlines ever written and the second worst book on the subject. Biased towards labor from the beginning, Bernstein paints Goya-like pictures of an evil Frank Lorenzo  and his henchmen cackling over a cauldron late at night, thinking up ways  to lie, cheat and steal Eastern away from the hearths of America.  At the  same time, Charlie Bryan is portrayed as some mythic hero who ". .  .read Ghandi and Kahlil Gibran and even Sun-tzu. . .".  Right. Bias  shows in the fact that no Texas Air management are quoted; no personal  attributes are ever given, making Lorenzo, Bakes et all appear as soulless  corporate thugs, while the stalwart union defenders with defiant chins  thrust forth, are given warm wonderful hearts and the purest of intentions.  I'm surprised Bernstein didn't have pictures of Bryan petting a puppy and  holding a baby.   Of slight redeming value is the fact that the book does  tell an accurate story.  Eastern didn't have to die and maybe Lorenzo  didn't have to kill it, but the interpretation and presentation are  designed only to support an intransigent group of labor leaders in their  refusal to see the reality of the world. This book is only marginally  better than the worst book written about Eastern, "Freefall" 
 I'm shocked that having spent, (what was it?) $200 Million, they couldn't have at least employeed a writer/director who cared about the original medium, Comics, and that pre-existing fanbase. I wouldn't be complaining, but to base it off of the original films, and then ignore so many gems that made the original films enjoyable, simply left a lot to be desired. I feel looking back, that the writers simply wanted to reach non-fans by writing a 'cutting-edge' 'non-traditional' Superman story. It wasn't necessary.  Lastly, while I love Lex Luthor, I found it a shame they chose to keep the Version of Lex who is a Real-Estate Obsessed Super-Villian, who lacks forethought.  I'm beginning to think the heads of WB don't know of any other villians for Supes to fight.  Most shocking is that they signed the writer's up for a trilogy deal, before this movie even hit theaters 
 I read One Step Closer first and found it a great book.  Easy to read with a lot of insightful commentary.  Then I read this book and just did not like it at all.  It reads like a college term paper and is nothing but quotes from other authors.  I just don't see how that qualifies as a "new book" 
 Very little of this book actually deals with the flight of the Romanovs.  The first one doesn't leave Russia until page 179 and most of the rest of the book deals with various Romanovs in exile after they fled.  Absolutely trivial, useless anecdotes are abundant.  It was impossible to keep all the players straight, partly because everyone had a nickname in addition to his/her given name.  It would have been better to describe each branch of the family separately, rather than discussing everyone at once.   
 This book crossed my path three times.  First was my undergrad thermo course, as a prescribed text.  I thought it was a little wordy but the verbosity did not contribute to my understanding.  The more they tried to explain the concepts (e.g., on Kelvin's and Clausius' statements of the second law of thermodynamics), the more confusing they became.  Needless to say, I didn't do too well.  That, however, is another story.  The second time was in my masters studies, and I was the TA for an undergrad thermo course (go figure).  I used this book for used examples and exercises for my students.  But it still didn't change my opinion on it.  Locating anything on thie text would take forever because one would have to peel through layers of words.    The third time, and also the last (hopefully) is in my Ph.D. programme.  I was flipping through the pages on the advanced topics (Maxwell's relations, Clapeyron's equation, etc.,etc.).  Their treatment were simply too trivial, and, with the lack of depth, I promptly put it back to the shelf.  Moran and Shapiro are, no doubt, authorities on thermodynamics, and I respect them very much, as experts in their area.  In their writing, it is quite clear that, they assume understanding can be achieved by loading concepts with words, the more the merrier.  In my opinion, if is more effective to go through the major concepts succinctly and formally, and go through their implications in more detail.  I think, this book fails utterly it this respect.  On the merit of its extensive collection of examples and exercises, I only recommend this book as supplemental.  As anything beyond that, however, the shear amount of diction alone will spell frustration for the novice, and redundance for the adept.  Finally, I think Cengel, and Holman do a much better job presenting the concepts at a beginner's level.  For the advanced topics (sans stat. mech. and quantum), I would opt for Callen, and Hatsopoulos and Keenan (if you can get your hands on it), with the latter as a reference.  Finally, for statistical and quantum mechanics, I would recommend Carter for a starter, and Atkins (Physical Chemistry) will do very well to fill the holes 
 "An American Tragedy" by Theodore Dreiser is considered one of the greatest American books ever written.  This may be the case if you can get past the first chapter.  Five times, I have tried to read this book.  To date, I am 0 for 5, having fallen asleep each time trying to read it.  If you're a bit of a lazy reader or one who doesn't want to work through a book, this is not for you.  Try Mark Twain instead 
 I'm not sure what to make of the reviews in praise of this film. They reviewers are clearly not fans of Arthurian mythos or historical films either. Where they talk about understatement, minimalist approach or stripping the storyline down... I see only poor plotting, poor writing, bad direction and cynicism. There's room in Arthurian Mythos for chivalry to sit quite comfortably alongside anti-war, new age and early feminist messages but the Director fails to take advantage of this.   The action is atrocious. We have monty pythonesque blood spurting scenes and zero fight choreography - we might as well have been watching Ator the Fighting Eagle for all its authenticity. The armour clanks around uncomfortably on their gaunt frames - cuisses worn directly over tights (I pity the poor actors) and helmets worn without straps, padding or gorgets.   The acting is not so much restrained as wooden. On occassion we get a glimpse of emotion out of Guinevere but she seems emotionally worn out. The writing for Lancelot indicates that his character is self-involved and arrogant, but the actor appears simply bored with the role and never shows anything resembling the frustration and anger that Lancelot must be feeling. Gawain is the only decent character in this mess and contrary to legend, he manages to get killed by Lancelot whilst avenging his brother.   Then there's the endless shots of people arming and disarming - shooting sequentially what should have been simultaneous. Not to mention the raucus bird cries, the incessant horse neighing, the truly awful musette (and I love bagpipes...), the local peasant actors (they look like Bretons), the gaudy pink and orange saddles, the castles without gates, the lack of characterisation and the linear plot.    It all combines to make this the greatest waste of money I've ever spent. I'd rather have picked up a copy of Dungeons and Dragons the movie. If I could give it zero stars I would. 
 Sorry to disappoint the believers, but this OS is way overpriced for what it does.  And, it will dominate you instead of the converse 
 Well I have looked into different books on beaded flowers and saw reviews of this book so I went to my local library and requested it. Well when I got it I sat and looked through it while I did like how the instructions were simple and clear I did find it was lacking in projects I got a few of the other books out there and feel they are much better. I did love the galeray of flowers in the middle of the book and would have rather had the patterns for some of those flowers instead. I will say if you really want this book find it at the library and copy the first few pages in techniques and return it. Don't buy it 
 There once was a film called Andromina, A low-budget, no-talent drama the Critics called "stinking"-- What WAS Boeving thinking?-- A truly depressing phenomena.   
 AArgg..  I'm increasingly disgusted by the authors self-promotion.  In each of their books it gets worse!  This time there is almost a chapter dedicated to refering to the authors other works and worse yet refering to starfist!!!    Pat yourselves on your backs some other way guys.  It's shameless and tacky the way your doing it now.  As for the rest of the book....Simplistic with sci fi techno toys thrown in to liven up the plot.  The main series is better but as filler Force recon isn't bad.  Buy the book used or borrow it from your local library.  It ain't worth the full price 
 book is way too simplistic. good concept, but could have been written in one chapter 
 The only reason I wanted this book to see the comparison for safety of car seats, strollers, play pens, etc.  Instead, what I found was a shopping list of infinite length, and almost no ratings.  Only 5 car seats were rated, 2 of which are no longer made.  This, after at least 15 styles of car seats were discussed as "potential options" in the body of the book.  I am very disappointed, and plan on returning this book.  Don't bother with it... you can find the shopping lists that the book provides at Amazon.com's lists, and this adds no value at all 
 I ran into this knife when I was actually hoping to find one of those short Japanese sushi knives with the nice little wood sheath.  A nice multi-purpose portable knife.  I have a lot of small pocket knives, but but one of the most common uses I end up needing them for is food.  SO here comes a great idea: a small kitchen knife with a sheath!  But there are some problems that could easily be fixed with little or no cost:  1. The handle guard hangs down below the blade, while a food knife is usually better if the blade hangs down so it can chop flat onto a plate or board.  2. The handle is shorter than the blade, but a short kitchen knife (ie, paring knife) usually gives you a useful handle length with a short blade. To make it worse, some handle length at the back end is wasted with that stylish drop-down bump, which is right where my pinky wants to sit.  3. The sheath has no drainage hole. It's basically impossible to give the sheath a good inside cleaning. Plastic sheaths for many hunting or utility knives often have a small hole at the end, so you can flush it out all the way just by holding it under the faucet. It's like trying to clean a cup by slowly filling it with water and pouring it out. Not very sanitary for somthing I want to use for food.  4. The plastic is cheap. Oils or alcohols are causing red stains when I wipe them on a paper towell. That means the plastic is not stable. Not only is the sheath difficult to clean, you have to be worried about what you clean it with.  5. The steel isn't that great either. It was sharp when new, but that didn't last very long and when it was time to sharpen it the thing just didn't want to get sharp. I have sharpened hundreds of knives and I have a dozen different stones, and this is one of those knives that just doesn't like to get very sharp. It's not an expensive knife, but I had a Victorinox parer I got for 5 bucks that was better.  For the price it's still handy to have, but it could be 10 times better and still be cheap 
 I bought this product in order to remove the scratches from my iPod. After using it exactly as directed, which involved large amounts of scrubbing with an unpleasant smelling goo, the scratches were still on my iPod. The iPod was shinier, I admit, but if you want a shiny iPOd you could probably use a wet cloth and get the same results. The miracle sounding 'gets rid of all scratches' is competely untrue. Not even the small scratches disappeared 
 While this 4-CD set does offer one of the most comprehensive collections of film music by the 20th century's greatest composer, I was very disappointed that they didn't have Williams himself conduct, or use original tracks from the movie scores.  [... 
 Levitas' book is well written and documented but it doesn't contain much that is new.  I've been reading about the radical right for almost 20 years now and there were no surprises here, only a rewritten version of what is in about 20 other books and reports.  The subject has been exhausted and this book proves it 
 I've begun reading this book and I was sailing with Thomas Moore real tight.  He was skillfully sailing the ship until I got to his fourth chapter where he got off into a skiff and cut the rope.  He has set me adrift in a wide sea without a moral compass.    He leads his readers into the occult and astrology. A place where a former Monk should fear to tread. While I don't mind learning about insights of the dark night through greek mythology and other lesser known personalities, I feel Mr. Moore could have served his readers better examples by using concepts and personalities from the Judeo-Christian tradition.   Mr. Moore holds too highly the concept of self and self fulfullment.  What I understood from Part Two of the book "Disturbances" is don't take responsibility for your choices.  Follow what you feel you must do in order to develop your inner self and talents even it that means to destroy and hurt your relationship with family and friends.  Jesus' idea was in losing one's self that we find out true self.   I haven't finished the book yet so I guess it's a bit unfair to write a review so soon. However, I thought I would tear through this book because the first 68 pages held so much meaning for me.  I've gotten bogged down in the middle and have picked up another book by James Finley which is an expose of Thomas Merton's thought.  Merton's Palace of Nowhere -A search for God through Awareness for the True Self.  I love this book.  What I am discovering from Merton is that the self we construct is an illusion but we need to find our true self through our search and union with God.  I believe this is the true purpose of the Dark night of the Soul which is to lead us to the realization of our need for grounding in the source of life.  I have two more books by Moore which I plan to read. Care of the Soul and The Re-enchantment of Every Day life.  So stay tune 
 The author of this book has accomplished nothing more than gathering a lot of GM service manuals photo copying the pages as they relate to all years of Chevelle and bound them up into a book. Where are the facory colors for  various body componets and a good aftermarket match? For that matter how  about some color photos in the book? Forget the book and go to the many on  line Chevelle clubs for useful information. web pages and get the  information 
 Dean Koontz delivers a rocky build-up to the closing scenes in Sole Survivor, but it ultimately stumbles badly on the hocus-pocus of evil government with good science & stock chase scenes pulled from only the worst of B-movies.  The main character, Joe Carpenter, is lost in a world without his wife and daughters, who were killed in a mysterious plane crash. But a chance meeting with a woman photographing the gravesite, who briefly tells Carpenter about the crash, leads to a shoot-em-up with the woman nearly being killed by her pursuers.  The reader then enters a realm of mediocre sci-fi as Carpenter, a former crime reporter for a major daily newspaper, begins to piece together snippets of clues to find out for himself what happened during the crash and if any of his family actually survived.  Family members with loved ones killed in the crash are visited by the mystery woman. Many of the people then become victims, killing themselves in violent ways, but are seemingly at peace while acting on the whim. As Carpenter closes in on revealing the secret, the good versus evil falls into the lap of big government, a big corporation and the mystery woman who knows everything.  If Koontz wanted the book to read like a draft for a possible X-Files episode, then he was successful. But even the producers of that once highly successful program would have needed several pens to edit a story that had so much potential, only to fail due to Koontz ultimately plummeting into the world of cliches.   
 mustic river is the worst eastwood movie ever well the acting is very good over all but the movie is very boring long and very disturbing it sucks  
 Please, if you want to waste your time and money buy this book. Sincerely, this book does not say anything valuable or new. There is a program (for free) RF-popHR made in 1998 that calculate these claimed kabalistic hours and you do not need the book for anything (I remark, for anything). The only thing you have to do is to adjust the hour playing with Time Zones in using a good ephemeris as Suncycle program (also shareware) 
 I can't believe anyone would even charge money for this "map"!  It's like a handout you would get at a mall.  Poorly done, and minimal information.  
 I agree with one the comments posted below. The main problem with this book is Mitch is a totally one-dimensional character and it's impossible to find any depth in him. Over the course of the book he doesn't change, he's unsympathetic, and by the time we've reached page 500, we don't know anything more about him than we did on page 10. I found myself dying to get to the end of this book, just so I could start another book with some substance and some well-drawn characters.  Another major problem is that most of the characters in this book use the same wise-cracking speaking style so there is no sense of the characters being different from each other in any way.  Overall, I thought this was mediocre and a bit of a waste of time 
 My #1 use for this scanner is for public safety scanning - I have family in law enforcement & we like to listen in.  I own a Uniden BC248CLT, & for years I owned a BC80XLT handheld. My BC80XLT was recently damaged & needed replaced. I ordered this BC72XLT, & am ready to return it also. It is not anywhere near the quality my prior Uniden handheld was. My 80 picked up as well or better than my 248 does here at home. This 72 picks up maybe 50% of the traffic of my others--whether in the house, outside, or even right in town. The buttons on this are awful, too. I have to go through multiple steps to do things that took only 1 button press on the 80. The reception, though, is my biggest concern AND complaint.  I never had to purchase any extra antenna or such for my other Uniden handheld to get the better reception. Also, the volume, even at max output, is only "normal" listening level--so if I am in a noisy environment, I cannot turn it up to hear it better. My old BC80XLT had much better volume.  An additional warning - Uniden's Support has gone down the toilet. I thought Uniden was a company that would at least *acknowledge* my complaint, and maybe even have some suggestions of a better product - all I got was an auto reply that I should hear from Customer Service in 2-3 business days--and then I never heard a thing. I checked my support question on their site, and it was marked "closed." Good luck 
 More Bain & Co hype, with not much evidence or substance.  Yes we know there is lots of wasted resource allocation, but we need practical solutions.   The book is full of pseudo-statistics, and like the earlier book, the Loyalty effect, many made-up numbers.  Evidence, empirical generalisations, hard facts are lacking.  This is the ultimate con in business literature, an argument from the particular to the general.  There is no ultimate question that fits all situations.  Buzz marketing only applies in limited circumstances.    Managers who follow this books advice are likely to squander money.  Avoid.

 I have yet to read a true Grisham thriller, but I plan to in the near future.  Having said that, I have no idea how this compares, but I didn't really care for it.  It's cute and has a sort of slapstick humor that I couldn't get into.  I felt like I was reading a teen or children's book, and I don't like feeling so patronized when I read unless I knowingly pick up a picture book ready for the simplicity of a good message--even then, I don't usually feel patronized or "written down to".  It's simple writing and a simple plot.  It's lighthearted and thus a light read.  I imagine many people would enjoy it; I just couldn't get into it.  :o 
 I found this book to be insulting to children and to educators.  This man obviously has no idea what he is talking about, his ideas are strictly from the deficiency model of student underachievement which has been shown to be a faulty method of explanantion.  Any educator who reads this book and takes it seriously should be relieved of their jobs ASAP.  In addition, his physical descriptions of his patients are bordering on perverted 
 Having heard so much about how this woman was the queen of conservatives I decided to give her books a try. However after reading this, I will say, if this is how conservatives are then I feel ashamed to call myself one. She touts on and on in the book about money, and how its every mans right to it yet no mention of how greed is one of the seven deadly sins. she goes on and on about how ALL liberals lie and how they insult each other. A many conservatives and liberals alike have lied however I see her being hypocritical (As well as childish) as she throws petty insults around in this book non stop.  she speaks of how horrible people who choose abortion are and yet when people seeking an abortion see conservatives they see people trowing bombs at doctors and protesters yelling insults, not a gentle person to turn to for support and alternatives. No wonder they don't look our way for help! All the souls I have encountered and helped in this area are not people "just looking for birth control" but people who are confused, made a mistake (though jesus forgives our sins most cannot forgive themselves) and are in need of some guidance.  Whats worse is she puts everything as a generalization of the whole entire section. ALL liberals, EVERYONE. No type of people are ALL the same, no matter what term you may group them under, and this just shows more of her predjuidcice to spread hate. ALL liberals are not the same and good thing ALL conservativies are not the same as her.  Sharing your wealth and helping the poor is just as important as personal behavior. To turn  your back on the hungry is just as much a sin as anything you might do.  Luke 12:33. "Sell your possessions and give to charity; make yourselves purses which do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near, nor moth destroys."  What ever happened to "thou shalt not kill"  Jesus chose non-violence, even as people threw stones at him he did not lash back, he did not return the stones, or attack others. Jesus said "love thy neighbor" he did not say for oyu to judge and hate your neighbor, God will do that as each soul reaches the pearly gates.  I don't know where this woman gets her blind sighted views but they seem more damaging then helpful. This woman is only spouting hate and making a bad name for us, I'm sure God will judge her fairly and she won't like where she is going. Until then I suggest you save your money on a better book. 
 I'm going to assume the book "I Captured the Castle" is better than the movie.  The cinematography is excellent, and the acting is decent all around except for the lead character played by Romola Garai. In her most dramatic scene, a confrontation with her father, she played out her emotions in an over-slow, melodramatic manner like a bad, bad stage play.  I'll give her a break because this is one of her first films, but thank goodness Bill Nighy carried the rest of the scene. The funny thing is when you listen to Romola during her interview in the special features, you think "Why couldn't we get this part of you in the film"?  She's an intelligent and witty woman, but her performance as the lead character was just underwhelming. That's a horrible shame.  The lead always sets the tone for the film. This would explain why the movie seemed to drag.      I found this film to be a bore despite the wonderful talent.    
 Those of you who hate O'Reilly will find this book funny. However, Bill has done more good than any news commentator in the USA. You can make fun of him all you want but he is the one getting results. From getting rid of liberal judges to protecting our kids with Jessica's law and holding our elected officials to the fire and fixing the Red Cross post 9/11 and putting the spot light on the ACLU. I can name many others but that will not convince some of you. The fact that he is the target of the liberal left says more about who they are than who O'Reilly is. At the end of the day, the truth will win out all the time. To put "Jesus" and "hate" in the same title is just another "satire" that can be excused by the coolaid drinkers but to the fair minded public, it is insensitive abd childish.

 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.

 I bought this in August 2005, when the original battery that came with my Nikon Coolpix 880 (late 2000) started running down fast.  On the page I ordered from, it appeared to be a genuine Nikon battery, however, when I received it, it was not.  It was made in Taiwan, and does not have the Nikon brand name anywhere on the battery (or packaging, as I remember).  This battery has never held a charge well.  It's about as bad as the original battery is now, and I've only had it a few months.  Maybe I just got a lemon--but I'd recommend you buy a genuine Nikon, if you can find one 
 I love many of the films featured in this book, have seen many of them, and have read many books on the subject. Despite that, I just can't bring myself to like this book. Many of the worst attributes (gore, depravity, etc.) are glorified, analyzed, and rationalized in this book, while many of the more innocent pleasures of low-budget films are largely glossed over.   While I disliked the vast majority of the book, finding it ponderous and pretentious, I gave it an extra star (I had originally given it only one) for the insightful interviews with Ray Dennis Steckler and Doris Wishman, two of the true giants of the genre. Steckler and Wishman contrast markedly with the ghastly Frank Henenlotter, and the insufferably long interview with the ever self-important Larry Cohen plods on for an excruciating 26 pages.  The book has a modestly interesting "Genre Articles" section, which is like a longitudinal study of trends in B-movies (and therefore is useful to serious students of film) but the self-indulgent "Film Essays" section is a painful exercise in over-analysis.   As much as I love most of these films, I can't recommend this book. It is smug and intolerant (especially of organized religion and the US military) at all turns, and there are many better guides available.  As a side note, the book itself is very poorly made. The binding on my copy cracked and fell off, with all the pages falling out during the first reading. The book was in such poor condition that I put it in the recycling bin at the airport when I finished it today...not that I'll miss it.   Two stars for Steckler and Wishman (and for mentioning Coleman Francis). 
 The author speaks of incredible global structures based on "white privilege" and thus reveals his work as complete and total medicine showmanship. This book could have been worthwhile as a laugh, but it is not well written enough and therefore comes across as garbage instead. The author pretends to speak on behalf of all white people, thereby exposing himself as as big of a charlatan as those like Jesse Jackson who claim to be able to speak for all of black people. This book is not even worth the sales tax or the shipping 
 I read this book after reading "The Wal-Mart Effect" (by Charles Fishman), and I immediately noticed that I didn't like the writing style in The Google Story (and trust me there was an extreme contrast between these books).  I think the title sums my aggravations up nicely: "The Google Story: Inside the Hottest Business, Media, and Technology Success of Our Time".  It seems to me that Vise is always trying to inflate the facts and turn them into some sort of sensational story (when he even bothers to use facts instead of a bunch of editorial).  Another thing that bugs me about this book is how Vise tries to inflate the "battle" between Microsoft and Google and make it sound like they are arch-rivals.  Google and Microsoft are operating in different spaces in the technology world currently.  Microsoft's bread and butter is Operating Systems, professional office software, IDEs, etc.  Google's bread and butter is advertising.  Sure, there might be a battle for the best corporate culture, but it's not like Microsoft releases Windows Vista and the Google team scrambles to release Google Earth 4.0 to show them up.  Vise also cites a speech given by Eric Schmidt at a school in Washington to illustrate this "battle" between companies.  I personally found Eric Schmidt's speech to be banal and irritating, and a mark against Google rather than for.  He sure did "attack Microsoft on their home ground", but how cool is that?  Schmidt pretty much acted like a jerk and tried to snatch up the best and brightest from a school in Microsoft's back yard so he could "flip the bird" to Steve Ballmer (who by the way is also a big jerk, so no big deal there).  But Vise makes it sound like it was some covert mission into enemy territory to make the world a better place.  As others have noted, there's no real wealth of "insider" knowledge on Google here.  I was hoping for a more technical book (e.g. I wanted more info on their clustering technology and less info on their investors).  He mentions that there was a fire that wiped out one of their data centers and their search engine coped with no problems.  How?  Doesn't it seem as if there would be a problem if a data center was taken out?  What about the search requests that were being processed by that data center at that time?  Still, I gave this book 2 stars.  Larry and Sergey were the saving grace, because their charisma and story somehow manages to shine (however dim or brief) through the pages of this book.  Because of that, I was able to get some value from this book.  But, I was able to derive value in spite of the author rather than because of the author 
 Sorry to say but this book is a dud.  While the concept of presenting interesting mathematical facts is great the presentation is so brief, so wrought with errors, and so incomplete that the work is not worth perusing.    Some of the "chapters" have answers at the back of the book and some do not.  It appears that the author could not make up her mind wether this was to be a "math tricks" book or a "popular mathematics" presentation substantiated by theory.    There are many other excellent books that are more fulfilling.  Journey Through Genius comes to mind.   All in all a disappointing work 
 Has this woman ever spent a day in the shoes of someone who has suffered major emotional/physical abuse?  I CANNOT believe that her advice is to find spirituality and even suggest the christian "god" as the MOST helpful solution.  I think this book is very one-sided and easily written without compassion.  Do this, do that...you should feel this...that.  Though she does claim that moving on is not easy to do...she sure contradicts herself in her statements.  For some of us, purely praying to God does not cut it.  What about the mentally, emotionally and pysically abused who aren't christian?  I think this book is not politically correct.  Though I decided to read it anyway and put my beliefs aside in an attempt to find something useful and helpful.  But this book just kept coming back to christianity and praying to God as an answer.  Aside from spirituality, if I could just snap my fingers as it seems so many of her "life" example subjects in the book who were often quoted seem to be able to do...why the hell would I need to invest my money and time in such a book?  I've already been told to snap out of it and move on forget the past, stop wallowing, etc.  This doctor repeating my friends and family isn't going to make much more of a difference just because she has a radio show.  Sorry.  Furthermore, making people feel bad about themselves for victimizing themselves and bringing their friends and family down in the dumps with them, isn't going to make them feel any better about themselves.  The suicidal, the ones who truly feel worthless will feel even worse at these acusations no matter how truthful they may be.  I just would have hoped a doctor would have better skills in dealing with the phsycologically distressed and would have a more compassionate approach to "awakening" them 
 This book is a sad excuse for a study guide.  It is a copy of pages from another book and lacks an expaination of the answers given for the sample tests.  I have passed 6 CLEP exams but this is the first one I ever failed.  I knew all the material in the study guide, too bad the guide had nothing to do with the test 
 I bought this book. I read this book. Then I put it back on the shelf where it has sat ever since.  I'm a more recent convert to Anne Rice's vampire books, having only read them since Pandora came out in '98 (By the way, thanks for that one Santa!)but I have since bought all the vampire and mayfair witches books. I enjoy the witches and the vampire books in two very different ways, and if I had not realised this before, it was made clear to me by this book. Unfortunately, even those parts I enjoyed were ruined by those I didn't. The introduction was both patronising insulting. Lestat's scene with the Pope, frankly silly, as has his very character become. I think the main problem I had with this book was the romance between my formerly favourite gorgeous fiend and Rowan, which seemed tacked on to the story as an after thought rather than a truely pivotal plot point. The series has been going for a while, and one can't blame the authoress for losing interest in the characters after so long, but one can't help but wish Lestat's final outing had been less... well, bland. I found the typographical errors frustrating, along with the plot holes and continuity errors (which others have gone into in great depth, so I won't bother with them). It's an okay resolution to the Witches series, but leaves the vampire series gasping and flipping around like a dying fish on the carpet. It's hard to say more without giving away the plot, so I wont, however, I will recommend other books by Anne Rice should this one not suit your taste.  DO read: Interview with the Vampire, Pandora, Vittorio the Vampire and Tale of the Body Snatcher.  Pandora, which I read first, remains my own personal favourite.     Now to address all the idiotic controversy:  1) Play the ball, not the man. When you write a review, keep your opinions of authors names to yourself. No-one cares. Nor do they care about your opinions of their private lives or habits.  2) Saying an author writes only for his or herself is not only a hideous cliche, but is undervaluing the work that goes into writing a successful book. If people are parting with their hard earned wodges of folding stuff  to purchase copies, and you are supplying copies, you are no longer writing only for yourself. If you are writing for yourself, it would be scribbled in private diaries.  3) On a public fourm, anyone can express their views, positive or negative. Variety of opinion is a sign of a healthy readership. Deal with it.  4) Don't feed the trolls.  When an author posts a rant, even if you feel it is justified, remember: Trolls who are posting merely for the attention take any response to them as a win and are thrilled. People giving honest reviews and critiques will find the vilification and insults defensive and immature. People who are devoted and loyal readers probably wont read any reviews. And those who make up the majority of the worlds readers, who have no particular affinity for any one author will take away a negative view of all those concerned. If you must reply to reviews (even the very off-topic ones) for goodness sake provide an calm and reasoned explanation do not denigrate, patronise or attack those with differing opinions.  This goes for reviewers as well 
 I may be alone on this boat, but my thoughts on this book are more on the negative side than positive. Although the story presented traits of originality, human flaw and truth, I couldn't help but think it was all too predictable. One could imagine what would happen from the first mention of an experimentation that would increase a person's IQ incredibly. Like that saying, "What goes up must come down." right? I found Charlie's efforts of finding an answer to what was going to happen to him next were stretched and unrealistic.  All in all, ignoring the predictability, this a phenomenal example of realization, "coming of age", and loss of innocence. Charlie's yearning for intellect slowly turns into yearning for emotional maturity as his IQ raises. He notices that with his new intellect, people started treating him differently. He realizes that the world wasn't as nice and comforting as he thought it was  before 
 I bought this, installed it, patched it, and then started going through the rather incomplete and disorganized documentation. The examples I played around with all worked fine. I started writing my own program, a simple math game with basic sprites and speech. I wrote a simple speech and graphics routine, which mostly worked. I wanted to try to figure out why one of my functions was going into an infinite loop and so I started the Debug mode, so I could watch what the variables were doing (very simple, basic, and common programming practice). Blat - debug mode crashes. Debug mode works on much simpler programs and for the few examples I tried out, but on my 200 line routine it generates exceptions. After the crash, I opened my project and found that everything I had written in my source had been reverted to an old version. I know for a fact that it was saved many times since then, but for some reason it decided to recall an old version for loading, as if all my Saves after an arbitrary point never happened. If I can't run debug mode on my programs or save my sources, then what's the point of this software? Complete and total buggy garbage 
 I have always enjoyed Rita Mae Brown's work. That being said, and yes, this  story line does wear abit thin, but the worst, unforgivable sin is that she read the story herself.  It was awful.  Several times she will start a sentence, only to stop and restart after a few words.  There was no feeling of character in her voice. Yoy can hear her swallow and clear her throat, so I guess it's the production values that are the biggest offender 
 It boils down to quitting your addiction, cold. And it's hard, really really hard. Personnaly speaking, I'm addicted to alcohol and cigarrettes. Lucky me, it's the "usual" ones. Without reading this book, yeah I'm being totally honest, just on the face of it, this book is BOGUS. If you're anywhere near a library, (thank you Carnegie!) check this guy out, for free. You'll "get it" real fast 
 I hate the song, "Tell Mw What You Want Me To Do". That is the whinniest, suckiest song I've ever heard. When I was a child, I heard it, and they played it on the radio non-stop. Needless to say, that has scarred me from ever listening to the radio again, fear of that song coming on. He sucks, and I just wish he and his albums would disappear. That's what I want him to do!!!! 
 Dont take me wrong I do love Mariah but this movie is not making any sense to me I mean Mariah doesnt seem very interest to "play" in this movie!!! This movie is all about music music music music music repeating over and over again nothing new nothing has been changed... come on!!! but then Mariah seem to be better in another movie called Wisegirls but again I honestly dont think that Mariah should be an actress herself I mean I think she is better off to be a singer instead of playing movies. Wisegirls she seem like she wanted to have the "attention" and "show-off" like saying in her mind: "Look at me I am in the movie!" I honestly deep in my heart she dont need to be playing in any movies unless she stands up and do her "work" with her actions in the movies not like this and Wisegirls movies. I feel bad for giving this movie a 1 star but I had to say what's my opinion about this movie anyways. Wisegirls was alittle better than this one! 
 i must address several untruths in ms. oates book.while she is certainly a good writer,apparently she didn't do much research for this book.she states that the majority of soldiers killed and who served in the vietnam war were black;wrong.blacks made up 12 percent of the u.s. population at the time,and 14 percent of the casualties.the average soldier who died in vietnam was a middle-classed white boy.next she states that champ jack dempsey was afraid to fight black fighters;wrong.he fought at least 3 black fighters that is easily verified,and his chief sparring partner was black.his promoter tex rickard wouldn't allow it,for fear of race riots.harry wills the top  black fighter of the time was afraid to fight middleweight harry greb.he also sustained a horrific beating at the hands of white heavyweight jack sharky.jack johnson admitted that the only acknowledged fight he lost was to joe choynski.while the "saintly" joe louis was dringing,doing drugs,and cheating on his wife,max scmeling was freeing jews in germany.incidentally max scmeling and jack sharky are both still alive at nearly one hundred.do some research please 
 Love the Beatles since childhood, of course John and Paul solo, even the occasional Ringo, but George always will have a special place as the unappreciated and vastly under-rated 3rd musical genius of the group. In many ways George was deeper on a spiritual and emotional level, which I believe was best reflected in his music and ability, all the while continuing to stay in the backdrop of Lennon-McCartney. I think both John and Paul consciously and unwittingly each burned this man to their own detriment. I think Paul realized this a bit too late, sadly, and may also regret not having spent a fraction of the time he used up in his downturn periods with John.    I have most of George's work on vinyl, cassette and CD, and my spouse and kids are very well aquainted with the majority of his work, whether they know the titles or not. I was very saddened by his passing, and of course wistful as I had been with John's passing - because I knew we were being "robbed" again of what might still have been to come. So I just had to get his last release, placing it ahead of anything else that might be on my musical wish list. It saddens me to say that I think George, of course knowing his condition and the inevitabile, likely just kind of let go. Maybe it just was a simple release from what he had previously wanted to accomplish, maybe he felt he had nothing left to prove (too true), or maybe he just wanted to express and vent - no frills. Maybe worse, he just didn't have it any more. For me though, it just wasn't the George that pierces the heart, mind and soul, that brings one to a deeper appreciation of how profound our relationships are and  what they should be or make us feel. This wasn't the same George, and I will miss him that much more.    
 I am a man with DID and I found this book insulting to those who truly suffer from its effects.  The book was written with an attempt to read like a novel.  The author obviously fills in many trivial events with specluations.  Since the Mr. West was NOT co-conscious for much of the book, he fills in the missing details with fluff and extremely poor writing.  The book is easy to read since it was written on a 5th grade level.  My eleven year old could easily sit down and read this.  The constant swearing and profanity left me baffled as to why the author decided to insert offensive language.  It didn't further the plot or define himself.  If it was an attempt to show the reader that he was a tough guy dealing with DID, it missed the mark since he spends most of the book refusing to take any responsibility for his actions, his family, and his diagnosis of DID.  The author spends most of his energy attempting to create a gripping story around his DID which falls flat in many of its 300 pages.  Not only are his sessions not realistic, but he paints his DID as debilitating deciding that he cannot work or take care of his family or even his young son.  The wife decides to work and puts the son in day care so that the father does not have to do anything but lay around with a blanket and toys and moan.  In truth, people with DID get up in the morning, dress, go to work, make dinner, help with homework, fix the plumbing, etc.  This is not an accurate portrayal of someone with DID.  Life with DID is hard and devastating, but DID is not an excuse to quit life.  Instead, all of life's responsibilities actually helps the person with DID to be in the present.    I found the therapy techniques in this book more consistent with DID therapy than in Fractured Mind.  However, Mr. West was not able to find a therapist who gave him the dose of reality that he needed until the last few chapters. The first therapist never encouraged Mr. West to be present or taught him the skills he needed to be present and function as an adult.  This obviously gave Mr. West the green light to whine and whimper through most of the book.  At the end of the book I became very concerned about Mr. West entering the field of psychology and leading others down the his distorted path of healing.  In short, I find the book poorly written with a great amount of offensive language, a contrived storyline with an abundance of holes, and an inaccurate portayal of someone who struggles with DID.  I am concerned that readers of this book will assume that there is important information within the pages that will help them. It will only assist the reader in becoming more confused about the disorder.   The Dissociative Identity Disorder Source Book is still the best book that will help anyone learn about what DID is and how to deal with it.  Energies should be spent reading viable material that will explain, teach and help those with DID and their support. Please do not get sucked in by the media hype and the over effulgent swooning of others who obviously have dealt very little with DID. For respect of those who daily brave the storm of DID, do NOT buy this book.  You've been warned.   
 This was my first reading of Jamaica Kincaid. She has a short, concise style, which made me often feel like I was reading poetry. However, I felt that it also had some downsides, like stifling character growth. In Lucy, the title character comes to America to be an nanny for a rich couple with four young daughters. Lucy watches as their marriage crumbles and tries to avoid turning into her own mother, who for some reason she hates. I wish we knew a bit more about Lucy, like why she hated her homeland so much. It was  an alright quick read, but had it been longer, I doubted it would have held my attention 
 If you ever wonder why energy workers are stereotyped as newagey, flaky, and also inprecise in how they define energy, i.e. they say energy is in everything, you won't wonder after you read this book. I picked this up on a whim, curious to see if it really offered a break through in energy healing.  There is nothing innovative about this book. You can find the concepts the author discusses in books on taoism and tantra that are better written and have a better explanation.  I tried his exercises out and found them to be not nearly as effective as he promised. If anything it seemed this was more like a diet lite soda than anything that promised a break through. I wouldn't really recommend this book 
 Anyone basing their understanding of this Austen novel on this movie alone will be misled.  Perhaps the director or producer wanted to make the film "relevant" to today's "hip" audiences (which don't understand anything sophisticated).  While the film was helpful to me in establishing the characters prior to my reading the book itself, I found that the novel has none of the raciness or even some of the scenes that are found in this film.  As is often the case, viewers will find that "the book is much better than the movie."  The acting is fine, but what the actors are asked to act is not faithful to how the real story unfolds.  
 eddie murphy is a comical guy, but is he really the right guy to play in something as stupid as this? Of course, who is the right guy for it? One of the questions i can't stand to think about in this movie, is how Dolittle hears the animals speak, but their lips move and nobody notices. Can't they connect the dots? Obviously not. And obviously, the filmmakers couldn't either 
 There is no other explanation. The following quote is all you really need to know to prove that Andrea is unstable and most likely hates who she is. "I want to see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high-heel shoved in his mouth, like an apple in the mouth of a pig." - Andrea Dworkin. If a man were to say something like this, I'm sure she'd call for his arrest. 
 If you are an avid Jance fan and have come to like and expect fast-paced action and lots of excitement from the "Beaumont" books, don't buy this one.  I usually can't quit reading a Beaumont book.  I've stayed up well past my bedtime on many, many, many occasions because I just couldn't put the book down.  I will usually spend hours reading the whole book in one setting.  But this book.....well, it just doesn't cut it.  I've started and stopped it on several occasions to read something else and only came back to it when I needed "filler" reading.  For one thing, several characters have undergone major personality changes.  Beverly, who was previously sort of a mousy, quiet, obedient character has suddenly become fiesty and mouthy and full of independence.  And I scarcely recognized Lars. And the plot is too contrived and the whole Kiksadi, Quicksady, Quixote thing is really stupid.  If this is the first Beaumont book you've read, please read some of the older books.  You will enjoy them.  But don't read this one 
 Amazon is offering a promotion where you are supposed to get a free TV show whenever you buy a DVD in Dec.  Well, they charged me for it, and I didn't really want it.  I just thought I'd try it because it was free.  There is no verification before you are charged either.  It is supposed to be free, you hit a button, and BOOM, there is a charge on your credit card.  NEVER AGAIN!!!  ..and the directions don't work, so I don't even have the "FREE" stuff I paid for 
 this little white janet jackson wannabe is a total sellout and trailer trash with nasly moans for a voice and stiff dancing. And yet 70 million losers bought her records 
 How is it that narada can pick over tons of albums and not come up with better compilations?This album is boring and the music is not even real flamenco.If you want authentic Spanish guitar music check out any number of awesome classical recordings by Julian Bream or John Williams and their performance of the works of Rodrigo,Sor,Albeniz,Granados,DeFalla,Sanz,Milan,Mudarra,and numerous traditional works 
 There is some very helpful information in here about how a woman's cycle works. I would be very cautious, however, about the nutrition information. Here is my story:  I was ovulating every 16-18 days with a 11-day luteal phase. Hoping to ovulate closer to every 14 days and lengthen my luteal phase, I began taking the vitamin Optivite, so heavily recommended in the book. I took Optivite for four months, and in that time I would either ovulate extremely late--30+ days followed by a 9 or 10 day luteal cycle-- or NOT AT ALL.   For whatever reason, I didn't immediately connect my ovulation problems with taking the Optivite (seems so obvious now). Then I read something from another source about how excess vitamin A can inhibit ovulation. I then QUIT taking Optivite. My first cycle off of Optivite, my ovulation returned to normal-- and THAT IS WHEN I FINALLY GOT PREGNANT.  It may be that Optivite has helped other women who were really deficient in some of those vitamins. But, in my case, I guess I was healthy to begin with, and it just screwed with my body 
 This is the WORST transfer to DVD I've ever seen!!! I think the VHS copy looks and sounds better, do NOT waste your money!! 
 The book's jacket announces somewhat presumptuously: "students on campus tell you what you really want to know."   My kids are interested in pre-med and business.  My neighbor's kid is interested in pre-law.  Clearly the Yale Daily News Staff assumes we don't want to know about the average scores undergraduates make on the standardized tests they take in college.  Yet, a high school kid thinking ahead to professional schooling might well want to know how students do on the MCAT, GMAT or LSAT tests at different colleges.  Just like the undergrad schools that use SAT scores as one factor in their admissions process, high school students could use this later college test information as one factor in their choice of schools.  But high school students are out of luck.  These data aren't included in the Common Data Set, and the Yale Daily News Staff doesn't ask for them.   The Yale Daily News Staff also assumes that we don't want any hard data about campus crime.  They ignore completely the information that colleges must make publicly available under the Clery Act.   Instead we get chirpy PR snippets such as that reported for the University of Pennsylvania: "Some students are concerned for their safety in the local community, but most people agree that safety in the area has 'really improved recently'." They deftly duck the issue of just how bad safety was before and what today's crime numbers are.  It's just another don't-rock-the-boat and somewhat lazy effort by a college guidebook publisher 
 Would have been a better book if the author had stuck to the subject of Freemasonry instead of spreading misinformation about the OTO.  The author does a disservice to the reader who might not know any better, as well to the many fine Masons who enjoy membership in both Freemasonry and the OTO.  Perhaps if he had spoken to one of these Brothers some of his misconceptions might have been corrected and I would encourage the Brother to consider interviewing a few Masons who are also OTO members for any subsequent editions or other books so that information is more factual and less sensationalized 
 I have only used this product for 3 days. The power suddenly turned off and can never be turned on again. I have to return it to Amazon. The bad thing is that I have loaded some my 2-year-old son's video into it, now I can not delete the files before the return. 
 I have to agree with the other negative reviews for this book. I bought it last night because the one other first name book I have was put out by Oxford University Press and includes a disproportionate number of Celtic names.   I thought this book would help me flesh out my list of possibilities. No such luck. As many others have said, there are so many names here that are made up, extremely rare, or simply bizarre, that it's very hard to spot the good ones in the mix.   What's more, in listing so many invented names, the author vioates the very advice she gives earlier in the book. Finally, I found her section of "fun lists" to be unsupported and arbitrary, and her etymologies to be incorrect.   As others have said. Save yourself some money and buy a smaller book, a better book, or just search online. This book isn't worth it 
 The advice he gives is totally absurd!  If a guy came to where I was working and greeted me with "Hey Good Lookin!" and handed me a cheap teddy bear, I'd think he was a sexual predator!    Maybe this stuff works in some places, but in the Midwest, you'd really creep people out.  I mean..."hey Good Lookin'"?  Ewww 
       This encyclopedia is for true believers in the Post Keynesian tradition of Joan Robinson,G L S Shackle and Paul Davidson.Unfortunately, this approach to economics can't operationalize any of the analytic tools and concepts Keynes developed in  the A Treatise on Probability in 1921(TP)or in the General Theory in 1936(GT).An obvious place to start is the failure of Post Keynesians to operationalize Keynes's concepts of the weight of the evidence in the TP,uncertainty in the GT and probability in both the TP and GT.Keynesian probability is fundamentally of an interval nature.It is quantitative and at the same time noncomparative,nonrankable,and incommensurable if any of the interval estimates overlap.The source of this analysis is chapters 15,17,20,and 22 of the TP.Weight of the evidence,w,is an index that measures the completeness of the relevant,potential,available evidence upon which probability estimates will be based.Keynes defined it as 0<=w<=1.If w=0,then you are dealing with what Keynes called ignorance in the TP.A w=0 would also hold in the 1937 Quarterly Journal of Economics article if"We simply do not know!"Other names would be complete or total uncertainty or the fundamental uncertainty of the Shackles and the Davidsons.w's between 0 and 1 represent cases of partial knowledge and partial ignorance.Here a set of different probability distributions or a set of intervals would have to be constructed.A w=1 allows a decision maker to specify a single unique probability distribution or interval.Given a strict application of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers,suppose that the data passed the Lexis Q-test for stability.Keynes would then agree that one could apply a normal probability distribution since an analysis of the data would support such a conclusion as long as the data was homogeneous in its composition throughout the series or sequence.Now let us turn to the GT.Keynes was quite clear that uncertainty is a function of the weight of the evidence.As the weight of the evidence increases,uncertainty decreases.As the weight of the evidence decreases,uncertainty increases.u=f(w).If w=0,then uncertainty is total and no estimates of probability are possible.In this case,the decision maker would exhibit a very high liquidity preference and tend to rely on heuristics,rules of thumb,habits,memory,conventions or a follow the crowd approach 
 I never received this book.  Apparently it had been sold to someone else the same time I bought it - that's fine, however, I had to write numerous emails inquiring on the status of the book.  I couldn't get a clear answer for over a week.  This seller just needs to respond with correct information so the buyers are able to make adjustments to find the bookd elsewhere.  I ws on a time constraint because this book was for school. 
 The arrogant way in which many evangelicals behave has me  believing they themselves are the New World Order.Here's my  point,if a religion wants to make all other religions obsolete, have controll of the economy and middle east,advance their  cause in a materialistic manner and rule the earth,this is  truly The New World Order.The obvious hatred of anything but  western religion and philosophy could have a frightening outcome.One of my dearest friends lives in Colorado Springs.Her family goes way back and they are very resentful of the many new comers whom have made their town a haven for born agains. You can't walk down the street without the feeling that some  evangelical will walk up to you and start preaching.This is just a start for them I'd assume.Their goal stretches over the  earth,to conquer and controll.Politics and religion are tied into one another and this is very common with born agains.In a  sense he is writing about himself and his chrones.Can't help but think they need to look in the mirror to see who the real  anti christ is.Jesus never condoned this arrogance 
 The prologue of this book lead me to believe this was going to be a very touching love story of a woman losing the love of her life and finding love again.  I was disappointed, soon after, when it turned into a gardening manual and a tale about ghosts, with a sort of haphazard romance thrown in the middle-and then even that was disappointing.  I mean Graceland for a first date?  I noticed a lot of similarities between Roz and the mayor in Northern Lights, and Logan and Nate from that same book.  None of them can talk in complete sentences.  And Stella, who comes across as this loving mother, who puts her kids before anything else, works from sun up to sun down and is so smug that she thinks the whole business is going to come crashing down around everybody if she isn't there to oversee everything, even though the place has been successful for years.  There is no addressing the issue of moving on with her life after the death of her husband, she just does it. Unless, of course, it was in the last 50 pages which I didn't bother to read because I just couldn't torture myself any longer.  And I'm a big fan of Roberts.  I love her Quinn brothers books and a lot of her other work.  But this just stunk because I could really care less who the ghost is going to turn out to be.  I'm certainly not going to suffer through the last two books to find out. 
 Now this books title is MISLEADING. It should be called "HOW I GOT BRAINWASHED INTO BEING A VEGAN"! Very little of this book has to do with women's health. It advice you to not to eat oil, fish, milk and meat, basing their "science" on statements, NOT FACTS! Very often source is not given or the logic is faulty. For example, at some point in the book you can find a statement like: your morning egg carries salmonella because chickens peck at each other because they are in cages.  BEWARE of this GARBAGE. What a waste of paper!! 
    Mrs. Weir clearly did not do the in-depth research that she should have. Among the glaring inconsistencies is on page 248 in which Mrs. Weir indicated that Elizabeth was taken from Ashridge on Feb. 12, 1554 later spending a night on Feb 21 at the village of Highgate. Raphael Holinshed in his chronicles of 1587 indicates that Elizabeth was taken from Ashridge on the 15th of March.    John Foxe and Henry Ellis (Two early historians)concur that Elizabeth was moved to the Tower on Palm Sunday, the 17th of March, not February 22nd as Mrs. Weir indicates.   There are other inconsistencies, please enjoy the story and do not rely on the facts.   Speaking as a professor of early European history for 18 years, these types of accounts only serve to distort history for future generations 
 An extremely informative series (Biology of plants versions) well written and in depth.  They ruined it with the 7th edition however, by putting two chapters( the ones on ecology) on the internet.  So the book, even though it says it's 800 and some pages, actually is thinner than the old 6th version.  Our teacher couldn't believe they had done this, as this was part of the curriculum.  So, not only would we have to pay about $120 for this book, but also have to print about 100 pages.... That's a sick way to make more money out of books, i'm tired of book companies screwing students just to make some more money.  I returned the 7th edition and got the 6th edition, which has basically the same information and ALL the chapters included in the book!  I don't like being this harsh, because i absolutely love the information this book has.  Reading it has added another dimension to my understanding of plants.  The Ecology chapters missing in the 7th edition are awesome reads, however and probably contain the best real world information that students should have.  As such, i have to praise the 6th edition for it has changed my life for the better!!! : 
 Way too much radio techno talk...who cares about "segues" or what disk jockeys talk about in detail to play. Basic story okay but not nearly up to his prior books...especially Heart Seizure which was the best 
 Parts of this story are entertaining, but parts of it tended to bother me.  What really bothered me was that Harriet did some mean things to people in her class, but her nanny never told her that what she did was wrong.  She seemed to tell Harriet to pretend to be sorry, even if she wasn't sorry.  That attitude is what really bothers me about the movie and the book 
 I bought this Basketball hoop for my son who was two and LOVED to shoot hoops.  Great height for a small kid, but difficult to adjust, latch always got stuck. Also, after a few months, the latch broke right off.  Now I have a hoop that is too low for the basketball to be any fun for my son.  Now it is just a $30 peice of trash 
 "Cookie Mountain" is an all-around mediocre album that, despite obvious passion and earnestness from the band, will age pretty badly. Most songs have little to no vocal imagination, the lyrics are bland, clunky and rhythmically sterile. Like a lot of music nowadays, TVOTR fuse a wide variety of genres, etc., without coming up with any memorable sound of their own. As for the "genuine, anthemic songwriting" the Amazon writer has promised, there is none to be found. Most of the songs drone on without any worthwhile catharsis. That said, "Cookie Mountain" isn't a painful listening experience, it just has no personality--it's safe, it's fashionable, will make most of the "Best Of" lists of 2006 and in one year will be entirely forgotten. 
 The worst movie ever made. I actually sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better. The acting was beyond awful, the story was a joke. I honestly was blown away at how terrible it was, do NOT waste your money or time on this movie 
 Kofi Annan is a sick man and a dangerous one at that.  Kofi Annan: The Peacekeeper is ironic in that Annan has been indirectly and directly responsible for the deaths of many people due his being asleep at the wheel at the UN, support for Arafar, etc.  Jeff Jacoby recently wrote that he is basically a symptom of UN's sickness.  Jacoby noted that just last week, Annan  woke up to a Wall Street Journal column by Glenn Harlan Reynolds, publisher of the influential InstaPundit website, urging that he be replaced by Vaclav Havel, the much-admired former president of the Czech Republic.  In The New York Times, op-ed eminence William Safire reviewed the revelations that link the massive oil-for-food scandal to Annan's own family: Until this year, his son Kojo was getting monthly payments from a firm that had a major oil-for-food contract with the UN -- even though he'd left the company in 1998. The corruption enveloping the UN will not begin to dissipate, Safire wrote, until Annan resigns, "having, through initial ineptitude and final obstructionism, brought dishonor on the Secretariat of the United Nations."  Meanwhile, the latest National Review was out, with its cover photo of Annan and the headline, in large red letters: "You're Fired!" An editorial inside insisted that "Annan should either resign, if he is honorable, or be removed, if he is not," while an essay by Nile Gardiner, a former aide to British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, explained why "Kofi's hour is up." With his record, Gardiner observed, "if Annan were the CEO of a Fortune 500 company . . . he would have been forced to resign months ago."  On Wednesday came another call for Annan's ouster, this one from the chairman of the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which has amassed evidence that Saddam Hussein used stolen oil-for-food dollars to underwrite terrorism and suborn at least one senior UN official. It is "abundantly clear" that Kofi Annan should resign, Senator Norm Coleman said. "As long as Mr. Annan remains in charge, the world will never be able to learn the full extent of the bribes, kickbacks, and under-the-table payments that took place under the UN's collective nose."  But odds are the world won't much care about getting to the bottom of the latest UN scandal. UN scandals rarely provoke lasting outrage. There was no global uproar when the brutal regime in Libya was chosen to chair the UN's Human Rights Commission. Nothing happened to the UN after its troops allowed Serbs to slaughter 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the "safe haven" of Srebrenica. Sex scandals seem to erupt wherever the UN goes -- the latest involves charges of rape, child abuse, and prostitution by UN personnel in the Congo -- but they never cause heads to roll in Turtle Bay. Annan himself became secretary general despite his failure, when he headed the UN's peacekeeping operations, to pay attention to warnings of genocide in Rwanda.  Why should anything be different this time? Oil-for-food may be the greatest international rip-off of modern times, it may have strengthened one of the world's bloodiest dictators, but if history is any guide, the scandal headlines will fade from view long before the secretary general does. By week's end, in fact, dozens of governments, including all the permanent members of the Security Council save the United States, had publicly rallied to Annan's support. Scandal or no scandal, he will almost certainly serve out the remaining two years of his term.  Which is just as well. Annan is merely a symptom of the UN's sickness, not the cause of it. His resignation would do nothing to reform the UN into the engine of peace and liberty its founders envisioned. Better that Annan remain in place as a symbol of UN fecklessness and failure, and a spur to those who can envision something better.  The UN is a corrupt institution, one that long ago squandered whatever moral legitimacy it had. The UN's founding documents venerate justice and human rights, but for the past 40 years, the organization has been dominated by a bloc of states -- essentially the Afro-Asian Third World -- most of whose governments routinely pervert justice and violate human rights.  Inside the United Nations, there is no difference between a dictatorship or a democracy: Each gets exactly one vote in the General Assembly. The reason the UN indulges vicious regimes like those in North Korea, Syria, and Cuba is that they are members in good standing, and most other governments lack the courage to cross them. The UN cannot be fixed unless that changes -- and that isn't going to change.  Kofi is a bad man 
 This is a poorly written textbook; rambling and fragmented information is presented on a piecemeal basis rather than in a clear, concise and well-organized manner.  Important information belonging to one subject-matter chapter, is often presented as "aside" information in other chapters on wholly different subjects.  This textbook appears to have been written by an author who forgot to take his ADHD medication.  This "substandard" quality has become common place with this particular publishing company, Prentice Hall, to include its many subsidiaries (Pearson, Thompson, Southwestern, etc.), to the detriment of the education system.     
 Can't tell you how well it works as it was broken! The cd lid does not close!

 This movie had many of the ingredients to make it truly great, including a phenomenal cast, lead by Cate Blanchett, and great scenery and cinematography. The actors playing Elizabeth, Cecil, and Walsingham spoke and acted admirably, each phrase spoken with such honesty and feeling, but the words themselves rendered the performances useless. The director and the author of the script greatly misunderstood the characters and the material. They should have read Elizabeth the First's biography by Elizabeth Jenkins. It is useless to say a movie does not need to be historically accurate but has only to entertain: had the author and director been more historically accurate, they would not have created the unbelievable character they created in Elizabeth, who is in turn hysterical, defeatist, overbearing, childish, tyrannical, who never shows her core intelligence, her great love of her people, who had a private core described by her motto "Semper Eadem", be always one. Elizabeth ruled with her advisors, she was not totally ruled by them. She would not have put up with Norfolk screaming at her across the council table, nor would Burleigh have allowed it. Cate Blanchett's wonderful acting and presence were pearls thrown before swine, wasted on a character portrayal that totally lacked any integrity, much less truth. How could the director think that the woman he was trying to portray was any kind of real woman? The ending had me blushing with embarassment for one and all. We are laughably given William Cecil as wimpy and ineffective, and Walsingham as the mastermind behind the throne. One of the reviews said that the director inspired Rush to play Walsingham much like the Hindu god Krishna. I suggest that he should have first read some English history 
 ESPN 25 seems as if it were put together by a high school senior trying to do a quick job on a term paper.  The prose and content make the book flow about as well as a lactose-intolerant person's colon after downing a double-thick milkshake and grilled cheese.  The book is worthwhile only if you can get it for a steep discount, and even then only if the DVD is still intact 
 Simply put: the movie is boring.  Clichï¿½ upon clichï¿½ is confirmed and story lines never come together. It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary. The main plot is very thin (a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince, gets caught and then warns the prince (why?)) and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting. So, a kid dies, which results in the "natural" response of the father: freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son's death. The lawyer has a drunk "friend" and keeps him around, why, no one knows. Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship.  All in all, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while. I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged. I neither laughed nor cried, I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause. It meant nothing to me, which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie.   Save your money, save your time, choose another movie. 
 After reading several really good Historical Fiction books of late I tried this book and was very disappointed.  Another reviewer remarked on it being tedious and I must agree.  I did not consider this historical fiction, rather it was a very predictable romance novel. If you like that kind of book then this book should be for you but if you are wanting something with much historical substance then this book is not for you. Serious Historical Fiction readers be warned; avoid this one.  
 Ross Thomas isn't exactly one of my favourite authors, but I liked some of his other books, so I didn't miss the occasion to read his Edgar-winning novel (his second, because he had won twenty years ago for "The Cold War Swap") and I have been very disappointed. It's as well written than usual, with brilliant metaphors and dialogue, but the plot seemed to me some confused. The characters speak almost only by epigraphs, and one never know what the story is about. I don't have in mind the other Edgar nominees for this year, but I'm sure there was many novels more deserving than this 
 This is the worst book in the history of books!!!!! My friend said it was good and i won't tell you that his name is cory shneck. Or SMS student. But it is the worst and most boring book in the world! Never read this book even if your being tortured 
 This is a good easy to read book.  It is filled with many excellent stories.  It is not a how to shoot or what gun should I buy book 
 Terrorists strike an America oil refinery with a small nuclear bomb. In steps Major Jason Richter, Army nerd extraordinaire, with his super CID exoskeleton. The hero of the hour saves a busload of kids, along with a beautiful reporter, and promptly gets placed on the newest war-on-terror team. The team starts to tackle the terrorist group responsible, but the team seems to be set up for failure with conflicting personalities and egos. The battles rage on around the globe, as Major Richter tries to pull the team together, find the mastermind behind the plots, and save his country from another disastrous attack.  Techno, yes; thriller, no. This book started out with promise and I really wanted to like it. But after the introduction of the major characters and gadgets, it quickly becomes cliched and predictable. The nifty new weapons systems would play much better with believable characters and a realistic plot. The pacing is fast, but the many twists and turns feel forced. Dale Brown is perfectly capable of writing exciting techno-thriller books with good characters - but this is not one of them 
 If I had a better grip on what it was like to be a woman during the era in which this was written I would probably like this novel a lot more.  But to be quite honest I found it to be almost unbearably boring and drawn out.  It simply reeks of the style of the times, which was to so forcefully over dramatize everything that work now seems almost comical.  The point of the novel was supposedly to show how Eyre was able to overcome the sexism of her time, but in the end it seems as though she gave in to the sexism and ended up getting lucky.  The plot is weak, the characters are unrealistic, and the language is far too melancholy.  I won't argue that it was progressive for its time, simply because of the fact it was written by a woman and openly spoke out against the sexism in society, but in our times I'm afraid the message has been lost in its tediousness and extremity 
 I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories.  This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing.  There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult.  I felt like I was in the "fog of war", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end.  Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?  
 this author has a bunch of friends that have given her good reviews - don't buy this book based on these misleading tactic 
 Jethro Creighton is living in the time of the Civil war.  It is just about to start and he is excited.  Jethro and his family live in southern Illinois.  So they live in a union state and have a union family.  All of Jethro's brothers go into the war, and also his cousin.  His brother John and Tom, and also his cousin Eb, go to fight for the union.  However, his brother Bill makes a decision to fight with the confederacy.  Jethro respects his decision and still loves him.  While a lot of his family is out at war, Jethro is still at home and expected to work even harder out on the farm.  All day he works in the heat, but he doesn't mind it so much.  But things start going wrong.  His brother Tom is killed in battle, it is very sad.  While that happened, some of the men in the down are very angry that Bill went to the confederacy.  They call him a traitor and said he deserted the union.  Then they start taking action for it and start tormenting the Creighton's.  After countless things they end up burning the Creighton's house down.  Then Jethro finds Eb, he had deserted the union army.  Jethro wrote a letter to President Lincoln to see what he needs to do.  Jethro doesn't tell the family cause he doesn't want anyone to get in trouble.  Later the war ends and Jethro gets his education.  This book was ok, not the greatest I have ever read.  There were things about it that I liked and there were things that I didn't like so much.  I liked how it showed what war is really like. It showed that enemies aren't always your enemies. What I didn't like is that it was sort of boring.  This book showed what war is really like.  Sometimes people actually want to go into war.  They do not see what it is really like. It's really hard to imagine what it is really like.  At the begging of the book Jethro is excited about it, he thinks that it will be fun, cool, and interesting.  Later on in the book he figures out that it is none of those.  He realizes that war is horror, filled with pain and sorrow.  His brother dies; he doesn't even know how any of the other ones are doing.  This portrays the way war is in a great way.   This book showed that your enemies aren't always really your enemies.  A lot of them can actually be your friend, even if you don't know it.  In this book there is a family that has a bad reputation.  The son of the man who started the bad reputation killed Jethro's sister accidentally.  But then Jethro goes on a ride with the father.  He is frightened but then the man saves Jethro from people that want to hurt him, so really he is his friend.  Also, even though some of Jethro's brothers are fighting each other, they aren't really enemies; they all still love each other.  	This book was sort of boring.  Though many things happen in it it's hard to stay with it.  There isn't too much action that you actually read about.  You hear about things that happen but you never get to read like you were there.  Such as all the battles, you just read about what happened, not as if you were there.  This book was alright.  I'm not sure I would read a sequel if it had one.  There were just things about it that were good and some bad features also.  I would recommend this book to people who like reading a lot and don't care if there is action or suspense in a book.  -J. Hamilto 
 Judging from the titles, the book should instruct how to make your own faux chicken, beef, and pork.  This is not the case.  All of the recipes call for prepackaged meat substitutes.  Personally, I don't want to have to rely on a grocer's, Whole Foods included, poor selection of soy products.  Almost everyone out there can figure out how to make traditional recipes vegetarian using meat substitutes.  If you are new to the veg lifestyle, and have never cooked a meal in your life, this book might be somewhat useful; otherwise it's not worth it 
 The book poses a very good question, one that most people are thinking about - "What will the future of work be in an outsourced global environment? "  But sadly Malone never risks making any futuristic predictions. This book captures the history of functional organizations and a some recent radical organizational models.    Internal trading concept for sharing scarce resources within an organization was rather interesting. In the final chapters Malone goes in-depth about the consulting industry's model of resource deployment, but he seemed to have missed out the key role that Resource Deployment Managers play in serving customers. As an earlier reviewer mentioned the concepts are over simplified and repetitive. It was an interesting read for me until I finished 2/3rd of the book, when I started to slowly discover that the book was repeating concepts and the author is reluctant to be making bold predictions as the title suggested. If you just want an interesting presentation on different organization models currently in practice then this book may be for you but if you are looking beyond the present then you will be disappointed.         
 This would be a much better read if you ignored all the  heavy-handed allegory about mastering your passions with your will and controlling your desires so that they can be sublimated into the fabric of community and the act of marriage, blah, typical Card stuff, and just read it as a story about a girl who wants to have sex with a giant bug. I'm serious--it would be much better 
 A tough book to read but it still doesn't explain why muslims are just so intolerant,of other peoples belief's. IS IT BECAUSE FOR ALL THEIR SCREAMING AND BOMB PLANTING THEY ARE REALLY VULNERABLE AND VERY INSECURE.IT SEEMS SO. And as a matter of interest WHY DID MUHAMMED HAVE THE POETRESS ASMA BINT MARWAN KILLED?  AND WHAT DID HE DO WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN.? Why did non-muslims have to pay Jeziya? Find out for yourselves 
 The sleeves are long and the shirt is short. I dont know about others but that is NOT how I like my clothes.... Wont look to good with low rise jeans! At least not with my average body. I dont weight 95 pounds 
 The only drawback to this case is there is no screen protection. It is nice that it has a clip, and it fits the mp3 player snugly, but... Would be nice if it has a clear "window" to protect the screen 
 It's not easy to criticize this book, because it is beautifully written and captures something tragic and poignant and important:  the emotional trials and conflicts of a spunky twelve year old girl who is coming of age in a world that doesn't understand her.  But McCullers' darker undercurrents taint the book.  Threaded throughout are elements of sexual perversity, terrible sexual boundaries with children, and hints at pedophilia, leading me to question strongly what in the world happened to Carson McCullers when she was a little girl.  Furthermore, the perversity often pops up in a disjointed way that adds nothing to the book's power, and thus reads largely as gratuitous.  A few examples from the book - a book which I did not finish because I didn't trust where its author was taking me:  1) The main character, a pubescent twelve year old girl who is nearly five-foot six, has spent her whole life up till now sleeping in the bed with her widowed and single father, until he looks at her one day and realizes she's "a great big long-legged twelve year old" - McCullers leaves exactly what he means to our imagination - and kicks her out of bed.  2) The girl's best friend is a six year old boy, whom she bullies and torments, and then basically forces to spend the night with her in her bed.  McCullers makes a point of showing how they change their clothes for bed in the same room - "with their backs turned to each other" - and then get in bed together.  Once the little boy is asleep the girl, who is two months away from turning thirteen, rubs his bare stomach with her hand, licks him behind his ear, and then nuzzles up to him.  (Also, imagine if their genders were reversed!)  3) The father takes a married couple as boarders in the house, but the girl - then age nine - walks in on them doing something overtly sexual with the door left purposefully open.  McCullers leaves it to the readers' imagination what her little protagonist viewed.  4) McCullers talks about the girl character, age twelve, having had sex with a neighborhood boy.  Again, she gets vague on details, but why is she sharing even this much?  If you were to remove the literary style and add a scant few more details, you would have child pornography.  5) Eventually the girl changes her name, wears an adult dress that makes her look much older - and goes out on the town and meets a visiting adult soldier.  He comes onto her sexually - though stops only because others come into the bar where he is giving her alcohol.  One is only left to wonder where the book will go from here.  Because this book was written in the 1940s the author can get away with it - and perhaps also because she's a female author - but really, it's disturbing and perverse 
 As a long time Beach Boys fan who is in his 50's, I was rooting for Brian Wilson to pull this off.  Unfortunately, this is a very mediocre album and in places really grates on me.  My wife made me take it out of the player in the car.  "Good Vibrations" and "Heroes and Villains" realize the potential of the 60's versions and shine as the albums best cuts.  Most of the rest of the album is unlistenable.  It is Pet Sounds progressing to the next level (not a good thing) and almost sounds like a Pink Floyd "Dark Side of the Moon" wanna be, only 35 years too late, and not as listenable 
 As other reviewers have mentioned, because of the made-up disease which causes her to gain weight, and failure of the character to really learn what she needs to learn from this experience, it is sort of a waste.  Could have been written better - and doesn't get to the heart of the matter 
 Basic in its approach to writing, this book may be useful for high school English classes but is totally unsuitable for college students.  Although it contains some worthwhile fiction, most of the non-fiction pieces are not very challenging for college readers.  The text is extremely prescriptive, and leads students to write formulaic papers rather than original and creative college level essays 
 I was really excited about this book when I first heard about it. I'd read through River God a few times, and I was eagerly awaiting a follow up... And I wouldn't really consider The Seventh Scroll to be a follow up, but rather an Indiana Jones type story that holds some references to the characters in River god.   I already felt let down and confused after the first 20 pages of Warlock. Something innate and compelling that permeated the world of River God was completely gone. The writing seemed uncharacteristically dull and rushed.   Maybe it's something to do with the way the narrative was changed from the first person to the third. There was something intimate about the reader's relationship to Taita's thoughts in River God. The story alerted you to his flaws and arrogance by letting you listen to him brag and congratulate himself. In this novel, Taita is a bland and uninspired figure.   I find it difficult to even recall the plot of Warlock. The characters were all 2-Dimensional and devoid of personality. If it weren't for the token Wilbur Smith gore and sex, this book would almost play out like a children's version of River God.   In some ways this book disgraces the world that he created and brought to life with River God. It is impossible not to make the comparison, and while it is an easy book to go through, nothing in this one stuck for me. I was bored instead of fascinated.   I actually found that by the end of the book, I was trying to discount it and just forget about it, so that it would not taint my attatchment to River God. In every way that River God was epic and inspired, this novel is boring and predictable.   If it were possible to detatch it from the first book and enjoy it for what it is (a silly action adventure novel about ancient Egyapt), I might give it 3 stars... but it is absolutely impossible to do so, and in some ways I almost regret reading it. 
 I was in the car the other day with a friend. We share different taste, but get along well. It was after school and I said I was going to have to do something if we do 'high school musical' as our musical next year. I listened to her and her mom inform me how it is the best thing ever. I watched it on my friend's ipod at her house. I wanted to turn it off, it was so very high pitch and predicable that is was horrible. She told be it would get better, but guess what it never ever did. There was nothing at all good in that horrible movie. I can't believe they call it a musical. Is this supposed to be a kid musical? Because I did not know that that meant a corny predicable thing. The songs have no meaning and I hate them. This by far the worst musical I have ever seen, no wait it is too bad to be a musical, it is by far the utter most horrible movie. What ever happened to real musical's : Annie get your gun, Phantom of the Opera, Rent, Music Man, West Side Story, South Pacific Wicked, Les Miz. Avenue Q., I could go on for ever. I hope this is not what musicals have come to. It is the worst thing i have ever heard or laid my eyes on.  Thanks p.s. don't buy it It is soooo stupi 
 If you're a fan of Rush Limbaugh and actually believe that Fox News is "balanced", you'll love this book.  If not.....well, you get the message 
 There's something strange about the way this book is written ... I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's MEANT to be a TEXTBOOK, but ... it's just strange. It's like, you would think that the subject matter (improvisation) would be associated with a lot of excitement and energy, lots of enthusiasm ... instead, it's just a dry, boring textbook. Very cold and impersonal. The other books I've been reading, including Keith Johnstone's IMPRO, Chalma Halpern's TRUTH IN COMEDY, and Mick Napier's IMPROVISE, are written with enthusiasm and what seems like genuine joy ... the way you'd think a book on improv should be.  Another thing that was odd - one of the co-authors is Paul Sills, who is apparently Viola Spolin's son ... yet in his "Foreward" (or maybe it's the introduction), he refers to her only as "Viola Spolin" this and "Viola Spolin" that ... again it just seemed so impersonal, like he was giving an academic speech before a bunch of old professors. No warmth at all.   And all through the book, Viola Spolin uses the same cold, impersonal language to talk about what should be fun, amusing memories - like, instead of saying "Once in one of my classes there was etc. etc." she'll say "In a class taught by this author, an incident occured at which etc etc" ...   These are minor things, I guess ... maybe I'm asking too much but I guess the bottom line is that, for me, this book (unlike the other books I've mentioned) failed to convey any sense of the thrill and delight that improv is. 
 Buying two of these.  Yes, indeed.  I'm the biggest loser of all.  I was so impressed with how this looked and the write-up, I bought two of them.  They are equally horrible.  One lost it's non-stick properties after the second use and the other became "all-stick" after the third use.  Do not waste your money on these things.  There are cheaper and better skillets available.  If you really want one despite all these reviews, please e-mail me and I will sell them to you really cheaply 
 I've given up on Dickey, this book wasn't good at all, and I gave an extra star. Nothing like his first books, and I know he can write better. I'm afraid to even read another after this one and Drive Me Crazy which wasn't much better to me.  
 Embrace, though arguably the first "emo" record as others have pointed out, is simply anoying. All aspects of the record (vocally, musically, lyrically, and production wise) are sub-par. Ian Mackaye, though boasting places in two stellar bands (the now legendary Minor Threat and Fugazi, the latter my personal preference), does a horendous job handling the vocal patterns and lyrics on the album. Songs like "Money" and "Do Not Consider Yourself Free" read like scrapped Minor Threat lyrics far too pointless to be used, basic, (even then) cliched, pseudo-political rants (against greed, government, etc.). Also, Mackaye's voice does not suit the music at all, his monotone yell just sits there, not even melding with the music. He can't be called "off-key" simply because he does not even attempt to make any sort of recognizable notes. Musically, it is typical post-hardcore / muzak fare. Lame guitar riffs and repetitive drum lines (save for a few choice moments in which the music can be mildly enjoyable, and even catchy to some extent). Fans who think Ian Mackaye can do no wrong would do well to pick this album up, same goes for collectors and completists, but for listeners of music, stay away from this album.  3.5 / 1 
 I WANT THE TWO HOURS OF MY LIFE BACK! After all the talk about what a cult classic this film is! What a waste of time! Maybe this movie was a novelty to American moviegoers in 1973. That time is past (even then, the "robots attack people" concept was hardly new). Now this is just a boring B movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action. This film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes. Unless you are doing a research paper on American Sci-fi cinema, or you are in your 40s and enjoyed this movie as a kid, or you just like boring anticlimactic B movies, AVOID THIS DULL PIECE OF DRIVEL. I FEEL CHEATED!     
 Musical scores were on spot, rich and compelling, imparting  emotional PUNCH! Chemistry was somewhat skewed between Kidman and Enman. The rule of "show don't tell" was broken periodically throughout dialogue, particuarly in Enman's dialogue when he goes from scene to scene "announcing" to each one he meets he's in love. Scenes were pleasantly varied, many of which were extraordinarily vivid and detailed with an interesting host of characters, however portions of acting came across as plastic and trained. It seems as though this movie tried to do "too much" and as a result the plot became vexed with business. A cornicopia of  scene effects, ranging from  surreal, to tragic, to tongue in cheek, to implausible (with the widow dancing and smiling shortly after she had witnessed losing her entire family to a massacre?) made it difficult at last to gain an emotional foothold and invest, although emotional offerings run like spooked herds throughout the production with the aid of ethereal soundtracks.  Speaking of implausible - The friendship that ensued  between the red-haired minister and Enman, in light of their initial conflict, seemed rather far fetched and silly, moreso with the minister commanding something more akin to a Broadway theatrical stage presence than a real person might portray given the strain of the times. Renee' Zelwegger did well but proved unbelievable for me in light of her typecasting and excellent role in Jerry MacGuire. Nicole Kidman was not in her element, yet even here in the role of a helpless swooner her acting credentials were present. This film was over-starred and substantially miscast. Didn't need Donald as Kidman's father and Kidman and Zellwegger's tension between themselves proved more distracting than complimentary. Overall the movie was interesting but lengthy to a fault. Undeniably a remarkable collaborative brainfest that in several ways might have been greatly improved. 
 This book came out at the same time that Judith Miller was doing the incredibly bad reporting for the NYTimes that lead the US into the Iraq War. Much of her reporting on WMD spurred interest in her book and increased its sales. I wonder how much her incredibly bad reporting that the Times has now repudiated as false and misleading can be credited to unconscious credulousness centered on the knowledge that more WMD fear would increase her book sales 
 Good: Motor drive speed.  Grip feel. Takes Nikon lenses.  Reacts fast to pressing the shutter release.  Bad: Skin tone renditions a color other than skin.  White balance doesn't balance well. Noise at anything above ISO 200, looks like 3200. CF card door tough to open. Screen fogs if you breathe when you shoot. Battery cover is not part of the battery.  Button placement not as intuitive as on the D100.  4.1MP allows for virtually no cropping of enlargements.    Dumped mine a month after I got it 
 Ethan Frome paints a vivid portrait of the beauty that is wintertime New England. Unfortunately, that's about all it does right. I was surprised to find the lack of both interesting and sympathetic characters in a novel that appears to be a character study.  Ethan Frome, the protagonist, is selfish and cruel toward his wife's illness. At times I despised him more than any character due to his extreme self-centeredness. In fact, his only characteristic that I can almost relate to, a repressed intellectualism, is barely even mentioned.  Mattie Silver, Ethan's object of desire, is an underdeveloped character in the most extreme sense of the phrase. It is unclear what her motives and feelings are even by the end of the story. However, this underdevelopment may have been for the best. The little that we are told about Mattie only adds to the disenchanting strangeness and sloppiness of the book. Most of the time, she comes off at immature and thoughtless.  Zeena, the supposed antagonist, is actually the easiest character to feel for. But don't get me wrong, she's unlikable just like the rest of the characters.  Overall, I suggest you avoid this book if at all possible. It's a loppy book with no real purpose or message. 
 Too broad, too vauge.  When it came time to put the projects together, taking what I had learned from the book, I couldn't do it.  Not worth it whatsoever 
 This definitely a magazine for gearheads.  It's pretty much just equipment reviews and advertisements.  I would have given it a higher rating but for two things:  1) I don't think I've ever seen Popular Photography not LOVE any piece of equipment.  The reviews can still be useful if you're just wondering what features the new gizmo has, but still, they ought to be a bit more critical if they're going to be such a review based magazine.  2) Many of the ads are from vendors with bad reputations.  I believe they make some sort of claim about requiring a certain level of honesty from anyone they sell ad space from, but it sure doesn't look like they have ever kicked anyone out of the magazine to me.    So what do you have when you have a magazine full of uncritical reviews, the occasional beginnerish article about technique, and a lot ads from stores of dubious virtue?  At best a 2 star magazine 
 I received a broken crockpit .... returned it for you to send me a new one, unbroken, and never received it.  Didn't get credit on my statement for my return either.  I have sent you several unresponded to notes on this topic 
 Ryan Reynolds is the Chevy Chase of his era&that can be good or bad depending on where you stand. I enjoy the humor in this film to a certain point&then it gets run of the Mill.I must say though Tara Reid was a Hot looking Momma,YES Double LAWWDD!! that chick had something in her eye-balls that made me look.but this film despite bringing back Tim Matheson from the films back in the day that were cut in this vein,has alot of hit&miss about it. it was Ok 
 The book begins with Huffington complaining that her cable bill has just gone up while the CEO of her cable company just got a fat raise. Poor Huffington, the victim of ruthless greedy CEO's. Here's  an idea Arianna, dump cable and sign up with dish network or Voom or DirectTV, or just cancel service altogether, its just cable TV not oxygen. She really doesn't discuss the fact that there are such alternatives. Why are there so many alternatives to those meanies at the cable company? Because of deregulation which she bemoans as the source of all the worlds troubles in the first place. This sort of nutty reasoning is used throughout the entire book. If youre an angry lefty by all means buy this book. If you want to learn somthing, don't waste your money 
 This movie, in a word, stunk. No attempt what so ever was given to character development.  It was all fancy camera play and special affects that frankly were not very impressive.  As a result, I couldn't connect to either the characters or the story.  This movie wasn't even a poor man's Raiders of the Lost Ark.  It wasn't anything!  Anything, that is, except trite, boring, superficial...  If you enjoy watching Angelina Jolie strutting around acting like everything and everyone around her is incredibily inferior and quite beneath her dignity, then this is the movie for you.  I was beyond disappointment with this film.  The only reason I watched all of it was for Gerard Butler who did his absolute best to bring depth to a poorly written, barely two dimensional character.  If I sound bitter, I am.  I expected so much more given the quality of the stars involved.  In fact, I almost, based solely on the cast, purchased this film without having seen it first.  Thank God I caught it on cable first.  I should have given credence to the fact that this movie is based on a video game.  Talk about two dimensional.    Unless you are completely bored out of your mind and can't find anything, and I mean anything, better to do I wouldn't recommend this film. I would recommend a visit to the dentist before I'd do that 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 A major shortcoming of Bazerman and Watkins' book is the failure to provide adequate evidence to support their arguments about what they call "predictable surprises", which they define as "an event or series of events that take an individual or group by surprise, despite prior awareness of all of the information necessary to anticipate the events and their consequences." Bazerman and Watkins build their case substantially on just two examples: aviation security failures leading to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 and auditor independence concerns leading to the collapse of Enron and Arthur Anderson. Several other examples are discussed in less depth throughout the text, however many of these are not actually predictable surprises under the definition provided. For example, global warming is discussed a number of times; however global warming has been in public discussion since the 1930s, and today a substantial majority of people believe not only the concept of global warming but that current warming is man-made. By 2050, this subject will have been under study for 120 years and popular consensus will have been achieved for 50-60 years. This is certainly predictable, but hardly a surprise. The United States' looming crisis in entitlement spending also falls in this category.  Flaws exist in other anecdotal support as well. For example, Bazerman and Watkins cite aviation security failures as an occasion when overly discounting the future lead to a predictable surprise. Quick calculation based on figures provided in the book show that, using equal discount rates for the expected future cost of security and the future cost of disaster, even with a disaster probability as high as 10% for any given year, the airlines would be ahead on a cost basis. The total destruction of both World Trade Center towers and the massive ensuing death toll was not reasonably foreseeable by the airline industry; based on the typical passenger plan carrying 78 people, this was the equivalent of an absurd 41 simultaneous aircraft disasters! Given the cost of implementation and the low probability of such a large disaster, even at a full cost of nearly $50 billion, the airlines' decision to oppose security measures on a cost basis was reasonable. The full scope of this surprise was unlikely enough that it should not be termed "predictable."  Despite some good analysis of reasons predictable surprises occur and ways to avoid them, this book is critically weakened by its lack of evidence. Bazerman and Watkins try to make it stand largely on just the aviation security and auditor independence failures; however these are insufficient evidence for their broad analysis and conclusions, particularly given the weakness of those arguments provided. This book would be substantially more persuasive with more anecdotal support 
 The album is rushed, being produced just in 8 days.  It did not showcase Casey's talent and sales charts speak even louder. Poor Casey. She deserves a better album than this 
 This telplay is supposedly based on the possibility of an asteroid hitting the earth. That possibility is real, and many people take the issue seriously. One commercial film, Deep Impact, also included some real effort to "get it right". However, there is nothing in this film that relates to the real concern about asteroid impacts. This is pure fantasy and thus a turn-off to anyone who has thought seriously about this issue 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 As an exercise in indulging the post-modern reader's understanding of William Shakespeare and the Early Modern Imagination, this book provides an excellent meditation by a man who has spent many years with the artifacts (plays and poems) of another man. Stephen Greenblatt's contribution to Shakespeare studies and his methodology for researching Early Modern literature certainly ought to be noted and applauded. At the very least, Professor Greenblatt indeed should share his own thoughts, meditations, and suppositions on the life of William Shakespeare. The matter of BIOGRAPHY, however, is an entirely separate issue. Greenblatt does not exactly name "The Will in the World" a biography, but plenty of readers and scholars (and Amazon.com) have erroneously recognized it as such. Accepting this book as anything other than  critical Shakespearean mysticism (rather than all-out Bardoloatry) should be dismissed as fallacious, deceptive, and misleading. Be wary readers of anyone who stretches 16 pieces of documentary evidence (all posterity can claim for the life of William Shakespeare) into a book-length "study." If you seek the mythology, then this book is for you; If you seek BIOGRAPHY, I suggest S. Schoenbaum's "William Shakespeare: A Documentary Life." 
 I was surprised to find this book on the shelf of books recommended for high-school students at my local bookstore, but the subject intrigued me, so I decided to take a chance on it. Like all decent sex manuals, it gives  good advice in many matters -- foreplay, treating one's partner with  respect, and so forth, but often lacks the detail necessary for one who  actually needs the advice in the first place to follow. And like most sex  manuals, the people who need it the most are the ones who will be the least  likely to bother with it. There is a long catalog of various names of the  sex organs of both males and females which was half-amusing, half-tedious.  Suffice to say that they are not all that different from the ones in use  today. Also, certain idiotic misconceptions abound, which will probably not  be helpful to most people -- that in order to satisfy a woman, for example,  a man should be rich and have a penis roughly a foot long. Also, certain  cultural assumptions are made which may strike some readers as odd, but  which in fact are very telling -- for example, in the period and location  when this book was written, fat women were considered very erotic. Hearing  a man tall about how he adores his wife's double-chin is rather amusing (in  this sense it makes a good introductory study towards ideals of beauty as  one finds in Wolf's "The Beauty Myth"), and lets one see that  contemporary idea of beauty are not by any means universal. Another  interesting aspect of the book was the notion that sex is an important and  decent part of one's life as it is given one by god. The author was  obviously Islamic and this shows over and over again, but unlike in  Christian writings of the same period, sex is portrayed as something  beautiful to be shared as a gift from heaven and not as a "dirty  secret". This is really quite refreshing -- in the west, we still  suffer from this lamentable malady today. The Sheik also takes it for  granted that women enjoy sex as much as men, and places a strong emphasis  on female satisfaction; something that only recently has become  fashionable. On the negative side, the chapters on beastiality and  tribadism were left out in Burton's translation -- necessary considering  the time in which he lived, but an omission which nevertheless leaves the  book incomplete. As a study in cultural values, it is quite interesting, as  a sex manual, it is obviously dated and could use much improvement --  modern ones are much better. Depending on what you are looking for, it may  be an interesting read, but still comes across as rather dull; it won't  replace the Kama Sutra anytime soon 
 Anyone who has read Reilly's books in the past know he's not a terribly strong writer. However, in the past, he has made up for the poor literary skills with compelling stories. Not so this time. The writing is so bloody awful, even for Reilly, that I can't bear to read anymore. Like mentioned earlier, italics are over used, and he's gone way overboard on onomatopoeia.   Reilly's other books are readable, especially when you need a page turner to distract you from, say, a long plane-ride. This is not one of those books, simply because it's written so poorly. 
 First off, I admire Dave Alvin a great deal.  He is in fact one of my musical heroes.  Some of the songs he's written are just flat out fantastic.  But it isn't just the music.  It's the person as well.  In the music business, integrity is almost impossible to find.  Dave has more integrity in his left pinky than most people do in their whole bodies.  That said, Dave isn't really a singer.  He works hard at it, but the instrument just isn't there.  He does a great job with his own songs.  When he starts singing other people's stuff, though, it can get dicey.  He's an outstanding producer and the production here is wonderful.  But  when it all comes down to it, most of the songs on this album need someone with the kind of vocal range Dave doesn't have.  I admire him for taking the risk of putting this CD together.  I'm sure it was a labor of love.  But it's not a pleasing listen for me 
 I bought this puzzle for my kid after he solved the original cube.  I had read the review here and other places stating that one needed to be cautious when turning the puzzle.  However, our major problem with it was that the orange stickers (within ten minutes of playing with the cube) began to peel back and fall off.  We tried using glue (they had no stick to them) to put them back but it was not long after that the green stickers began curling back and falling off as well.  The major problem is that these turned out not to be "stickers" after all, but rather colored squares of vinyl adhereing to additional stickers beneath (all white) by means of static.  They fall off easily.  This is a nice puzzle for show (impressive on the desk) but not for actual continued use.  Hopefully, Rubik's can use proper stickers or adhesive in the future and maybe even tighten up the design so that this can be used as a fun puzzle 
 ......I always suspected that Gilbey and Smith were the same person. In his (their) first book, Secret Fighting Arts Of The World, Gilbey (Smith) gave a very good narrative of useful and real techniques although experience and a good deal of thought were required to fill in the gaps of information needed to make most of the techniques work. In this second book the author has done a formidable job of saying next to nothing. The work is filled with inconsistencies as well as typographical, syntaxique and spelling errors and has a rather boring and awkward style. If you feel you must have it "just to see" then don't expect too much for your purchase 
 An Autobiography of Jack Gantos told under the name of Joey Pigza. While Jack Gantos sits in his jail cell he tells you the story of how he got there. Young Jack wants to be a writer, but growing up in a poor family means that he doesn't have the money to go to school. So he goes to live with his grandparents in the Virgin Islands. Shortly discovering how much Jack drinks, they kick him out. 	From there, he goes to live with a family who have an extra room and he messes that up too when he gets sick all over their house. After going through that and a ghetto hotel, he goes home to St Croix to live with his parents and work with his dad. He makes minimum wage by making and shipping crates. When a gut named Hamilton comes in with blueprints for a special crate for smuggling hash he offers jack a job. Jack sees the opportunity to get rich quick and use it to go to college, he had no second thoughts. He ends up in a medium security prison for smuggling drugs to the US. 	I really enjoyed this book because I, myself have done wrong things to do good things. I've also thought about doing things to get money quick. It's easy to make bad decisions when things are hard in life. this is an awsome book for teenagers to read and i think everybody should read this 
 Just a warning - 8 minutes doesn't count warm up, stretching, or the time it takes you to get up from the floor and situated to the next exercise (something that I find really annoying and ineffecient!).  I have not read Jeorge's book.  I got the routine from an excerpt in O! I don't understand why he doesn't pair exercises that are both on the floor or both standing - it's such a pain getting up and down, up and down.  Plus, I feel like you lose that whole idea of "no rest".  I'm sure I expend more calories to get up an down, but it's all too easy to take a sip of water or just in repositioning yourself.  I have been following WW while I have been doing the 8m workout (more like 10-15 for me), and I have not lost one pound.  I'll keep doing it, because it's probably better than nothing, but I'm not impressed so far (about 3 weeks) 
 I've read all of Flynn's books. In fact, I just picked up Act of Treason. As I'm reading it, I'm reminded of how disgusted I was with his last book, Consent to Kill, only giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.  Without giving away the ending, Consent to Kill is but an amateur attempt to keep a tired saga alive for the sake of a bestselling serial--that being the Mitch Rapp saga. To any real fiction writer, what Flynn resorts to in the book, in terms of Mitch's personal relationship, is quite sad; it's simply designed to keep Mitch "hungry" and "emotionally tattered" so as to allow Flynn to continue cashing in on the only story he's capable of writing.  The book started out to be intriguing, although I did ask myself how Flynn intended to keep Mitch going with the seeming direction our star spy was headed via the last novel. But, the story read like a tenth grader wrote it, a tired cliche designed for the sole sake of keeping Mitch Rapp and his million-dollar franchise chugging along.  By far the worst story Flynn has written to date. Skip this one 
 Someone recommended this book as the epitome of Augustine's philosophical work. It tries to replicate the style of Plato's dialogues, but its shallow logic, infantile writing, and general  poor scholarship as well as just plain lousy thought and development makes me feel like I got gypped buying it.If I could, I  would ask for a refund. Ugggg 
 I found this novel aesthetically pleasing, well written and interestingly structured, as well as witty in places, but hardly hilarious as others here have suggested. Regarding the book seeming to be written by a female (with all the presumptions of enlightenment that that carries with it - in this text and in literati generally) due its satirical reworkings of phallocentric myths and legends, I would say that the first 'novel' in history by Cervantes did just that, so phallused author's have a decent tradition in that area; having said that, this comment made the course material of my literature course at university, so you can see how pervasive it is. I don't blame the book for its strident and parochial feminist/misandrist and postcolonial themes - there is almost a complete cultural saturation of it. The book works in very well with current literary theory and should be used by all like-minded people as a text to place new 'Portias' and 'Shylocks' in different racial/cultural groups - same sort of hatreds with different wrappings. It's a shame, because King's talents as a writer are very great, despite the ideolatry. 
 I waited along time to buy this coffee maker...after it finally went on sale I went and made the plunge and bought it.  I was so excited when I finally got it, but boy...was I wrong.  It is very complicated to get it programed.  It was very unclear...also there are too many parts to it and too hard to clean.  The most dissapointing part was the thermal caraf.  It took at least about 30 seconds for a full cup to be poured...it was so slow.  There is no adjustment to the lid.  What a waste of time and money.  I wish I had read all the reviews before I bought it 
 Bought this book to look up some very old records that my folks had. Maybe 1 out of 50 is listed. This book is a piece of doodoo 
 This is my third Vince Flynn book, and I was thoroughly disappointed.  "Executive Power" incorporates two stories, neither of which have anything to do with each other.  It's as if Flynn had enough for two half stories and then squished them together.  The first is a story about an American family kidnapped in the Philippines. Lurking in the background is another story set in the Middle East.  I thought Flynn was going to bring the two stories together.  But he never did.  He resolved one in sweeping fashion and then focused on the other.  If you only read one Vince Flynn book, I recommend that you read "Transfer of Power."  THAT is an exciting book.  But stay away from "Executive Power."  You'll be thoroughly disappointed 
 Flynn is half-crazy and I can't for the life of me understand how he was able to type with his arms in a strait-jacket. With a book this awful to his credit, he'd make a great White House reporter 
 I purchased this years ago and tried to read it but found it hopeless.  The style, mistakes and flat out omissions make this useless.  Wheelock's Latin is far better and worth the money for textbook as well as the workbook 
 Amazing how a writer can attempt to make an immoral organization, the corporation, look moral. Only someone like Al Capone could sympathize with this group on the Oregon. How can anyone justify having the sort of firepower as is on the Oregon. The US apparently is willing to finance the group, but the US also financed Sadam, Noriega, ... Unfortunately, in this sense it is too much like real American policy, which absolutely disgusts me (the ends justify the ends no matter how many bodies are left behind, as long as they are not righteous Americans). The characters are clichï¿½, there is no suspense since everything goes as planned, and anyone in the crew can just about do anything, including being a successful rock band. It makes me look back on the Dirk Pitt books and wonder about Dirk's morality 
 Improbable people in implausible situations driven by too-convenient motivations.  A thin veneer about anthropology, development, political philosophy, and Africa that drags the story along but does little to enlighten.  Obviously written with a well-thumbed thesaurus at hand, the author's vocabulary use is more tortured than inspiring.  (Or, as Mark Twain put it, "it grates on the fastidious ear.")  A decent plot, but a snoozer in its execution.  The characters are drawn with multi-layered histories that are informational but exact no empathy.  
 The movie is great but the cd is defective.  It keeps on getting stuck on the same spot.  I'm trying to return it but I can't get any reply to my e-mails 
 While I was amazed by the story of the sailors and rescuers, I was disappointed by the presentation of the material.  I wasn't emotionally attached to any of the people because the individual accounts were  sporadically placed.  In addition, there were so many people and yachts  crammed into the book, I felt I needed a flow chart to keep anyone  straight.  On a final note, I feel those with limited or no knowledge of  yachting will struggle with the technical terms.  I have no prior knowledge  of yachting, and I don't feel I walked away having learned anything.  I  believe the author assumed an audience with a high level of nautical  understanding, but it was marketed as a adventure/survival story 
 This is a very odd movie, which Leonard Maltin amusingly calls financial science fiction. Director Alan J Pakula is in one of his paranoid conspiracy theory moods a la Parallax View and All the Presidents Men, and as Jane Fonda's IPC company produced it, she thinks she's doing The China Syndrome. Apparently international currency is dependent on the Saudi Arabians whose ownership of oil makes them the richest people in the world. When they contemplate investing in gold rather than lending their wealth to support the banks, wall street fears a new world depression. This all sounds very scary until one wonders if the Arabs bankrupt everyone, what good will the gold be? One also wonders how seriously we are to take this when Pakula casts Kris Krisofferson, sans beard, as a banking troubleshooter! Casting Fonda as a former movie star who gave up her career to marry money is kind of prophetic consider her future marriage to Ted Turner. We aren't given a clue as to what kind of actress her character was, but the way Fonda is styled and lit suggests Joan Crawford, so then we can free associate Crawford with Pepsi and Al Steele. Whatever suspense Pakula is trying for is ruined by an awful music score by Michael Small, and the romance between Kristofferson and Fonda doesn't work either. Kristofferson is laughable as a he-man, and there is something icky in the idea that this is the kind of behaviour that Fonda responds to. There is also the unfortunate coincidence of their matching hairstyles - it recalls Lily Tomlin and John Travolta in Moment by Moment. One curiosity is the kind of computer software used at the time 
          I was reading this magazine at work, and I consider it to be a trashy magazine. It only focuses on the sexual part of women, like if sex is the best thing in the world, because they had this article in which a girl was riding a taxi, and she thought the taxi guy was fine, so she unbutton her shirt and told the taxi guy to touch her breasts. And then she says it was the *best experience she ever had. I just cant believe they publish garbage like that, giving the message to women that its ok to undress yourself with a total stranger, who you dont even know. I prefer to read things that focus more on the inner heart, on the emotional, and spiritual side of things. And read books that will help me be a better person right now and the future, and throw away the garbage this society has 
 I'm a very spiritual person and I was expecting this CD to provide daily inspiration and help me to remember the very few things that are important in life.  Unfortunately, for me at least, the CD is rather boring and not very inspirational.  I'm about 30 minutes in to it and have decided to stop listening to it.  Fortunately I have a Christian radio station that does a lot more for me. 
 Reading this book put me to sleep. It honestly should be a 0. You can find the same material free at your local library 
 I bought this DVD for my husband and 2 boys as a Father's Day gift & we were all quite disappointed. Instead of action-packed, it's amateur video clips & boring narration. Save your (... 
 I see all the people here like this book, but I don't get why.  The first half is unpleasant though intriguing.  Styron seems to think it is interesting for characters to rant eccentrically about whatever is on their mind, but I would disagree, and I soon started skipping all rants.  The story is intriguing, and for a while the book was kind of interesting, as we see the naive narrator come to see the truth of his pretentious friend.  Half way through, the book becomes fairly unreadable as it changes focus to a different character.  This begins with an entire chapter of the sort of rant that I found so unpleasant, and then proceeds through a tedious accounting of an unpleasant and dull tortured artist type.  I tried reading this for a while but it was so annoying that I just skimmed the second half to see how everything was tied up, which it was in a perfunctory fashion.  I suppose this is good for Styron fans.  I've never read any of his books before and certainly never will again 
 The Starter Wife started out promisingly vapid, in an entertaining way, but rapidly became more disgusting than anything else.  The narcissitic self obsession rang true (not surprising given the author's similar lifestyle), and the ways in which it was indulged were fascinatingly ridiculous.  However, those descriptions only hold interest for so long, and then the book digresses into an unrealistic, annoying conclusion.  The insight into an actual L.A. Wife Of lifestyle is unbelievable enough; to try to throw in a homeless guy that leads an exemplary lifestyle then reconciles with his family and inherits their billions... there's a limit to the willful suspension of disbelief.  
 Way too expensive for a low quality product.  The clarity of the picture is poor.  There is not enough content to justify the price.  I don't recommend it at all.  I feel I've been cheated 
 ...and save your money. There were parts of this book that intrigued me. I pick out books by reading the back cover, and then the first page, and that hooked me. But it was a let down as the book continued. I think Ray begins to delve into some real psychological issues here, but unless you plan to analyze the book from a psychiatric view point, you are most likely just going to feel frustrated. I read half the book, then skimmed through, hoping to find something interesting or redeeming, only to find the completely disappointing conclusion (if you can call it that) of the book. Maybe something is lost in translation (brush up on your U.K. slang before reading), but I just couldn't get into this book 
 In a historical novel, I look for immersion in another place and time, and involvement with characters that I can care about. For me, Trent has not succeeded in either of these areas.  Although the author has a good grasp of our sketchy historical knowledge of the events in Alexandria in the early fifth century, I don't get the sense that he has done much research on the broader history of this fascinating time -- to say nothing of the geography. The basics are all in place: the brilliant philosopher Hypatia, the Great Library, the religious turmoil, the tension between church and state. But there's little in the way of detail to give you the sense of being there, and as often as not the detail is wrong. For example, the desert ascetics did not wear brown (the pagan sources are full of vilification of black-robed monks). Governors and bishops travelled in carriages with large retinues, not alone in chariots like characters from "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." (The "chariot" used by Hypatia is more likely to have been something like a sulky.) And no one ever met a woman by being asked to dance, because the Romans did not engage in social dancing. As for the geography, I'm still trying to figure out how you can get a view of the Nile from the western wall of Alexandria, which itself lies west of the delta -- and Antioch was certainly not in Persia!  Trent's writing is fluid enough, and occasionally there's a vivid and memorable image, but he has a poor ear for diction and often chooses words that are jarring or even incorrect. For instance, from a scene where a minor character visits her husband's grave: "She descended the broken steps to the fence. _What am I doing?_ she screamed." (The underscores signify italics, which the author uses for characters' thoughts.) "Screamed" hardly seems the word to express inner doubts, but it's typical of the clumsy way in which Trent tries to inject life into his characters.  Indeed, we spend far too much time in the heads of the characters as they verbalize their thoughts and feelings. Not only does this fail to bring them to life (it mostly just makes them annoying); it also slows the pace of the action to a crawl.  Hypatia herself is an uneasy mixture of intellectual, political, and emotional ingredients that never coalesce into a character we can care deeply about. Indeed, the book as a whole never makes up its mind whether it's a novel of ideas or a romance, as the perspective shifts between the major players  discussing philosophy, religion, and politics, and various love affairs or infatuations.   Many of the problems of this book could have been cleared up by a good editing, but as is too often the case these days, that stage of production seems to have been skipped. (How else would we see "palate" for "palette" and "reigns" for "reins"?) As it is, we have an ambitious effort by someone who simply lacks the writing skills to carry it off. 
 I have two words for you... bat droppings. This is definitely the worst $50 I ever spent. It's flimsy, it doesn't go back together, and getting it together took an engineering degree. I wish I had read up on it before buying it. 
 It would be nice, as a couple of other reviewers stated, to have included some of the "score" as well as the songs and arrangements already present.  I was hoping their would be a bit of that when I ordered it.  The songs are good but didn't warrant listening to the CD more than a couple of times 
 This cd was givin to me as a gift and I'm glad it was because it would have been a waste of money. There is only one good song on the whole cd, "Lost In Space." There is way to many vocal songs on a "smooth jazz" cd. Paul uses the same backround in many of the songs which makes you feel as if you are listening to one long, never ending,song. I despised the group until one day i heard and fell in love with their "GREATEST HITS." And thankfully "Lost in Space" is on there. I recommend buying that cd, it should be in every smooth jazz fans collection 
 I would have given this 3 stars just to be polite to a man whose music I respect very much but with all of the 4 and 5 star reviews on this site, someone needed to step in and provide some balance. Swing Low Sweet Chariot is nice and EC's cover of The Sky Is Crying is pretty good  but I'd lean toward Elmore Jame's original or SRV's before this one.  I'm a long-term EC fan, from his days with the Yardbirds on.  If I had a penny for every time I've listened to him play a tune, I'd probably own Amazon!  So I love the man and his music and I'm not calling this a BAD disc.  I'm just trying to put some dynamic range in the rating process.  There are people out there that use these reviews to make buying decisions and if you're one of them, I'd hope that you already had at least 20 Clapton CDs before you point your credit card at this one.  
 I am relatively new to craps. I can play but don't really understand the nuance of the game. Saw the reviews and bought it.   I find John's banter intolerable: "macho type dude, with muscles bigger than Dolly Pardon's trademarks," "Does Sophia Loren look like a boy?". I'm sure it a generational thing. It's kind of like having Buddy Love teach you trigonometry.   Anyway, some good information that's just really hard to get to. I'm looking for something modern and less dramatic.  
 This book is tired and out of date.  It is time to retire this textbook 
 K, besides the late arrival, the whole book was written in terminology in which I had to read over and over again before I understood the meaning. Its not like the book came with appendices right? Anyway, I do not know whats the huu haa about the book. It seems pretty fictional. Coming from a Muslim 
 Hi, In a nutshell, if you have a visual learner who likes colour, or one who struggles to blend this book is not for you.  My four year old was totally turned off by this so instead, we purchased the online Headsprout programme and now he is a really confident reader in a short time.  My advice is to go for a different book but if your budget allows, buy Headsprout because it is brilliant and it works.  My son loves reading because of that programme. Hope that helps you. Fay 
 Sorry, but I would not recommend this book.  As a "reference guide" I really expected more.  Probably a good buy at $19.95, but I'll sell you mine for $85.00 
 Although the book presents itself as a grammar guide, it actually only contains pages of mostly worthless rules on the gender of nouns. If you want excercises or to actually learn grammar, then don't buy this book. I would recommend "501 German Verbs" 
 Not a CD to buy when wanting easy listening too boring - made for German market.  Booklet with CD.    Robert Mitchum's gravelly voice does not come through as it should.  Not a good buy. Recommend Calypso Is Like So 
 Cause i grew up listening to chuck,i give 3 stars,but that aint chuck i knew from rapalot,but like a tru fan i got the cd anyway,some tracks are ok,but that aint bill,if you are a wick fan buy it for your collection,if you aint,dont 
 Half paean to old-time radio, half murder mystery, this overly melodramatic WWII-era set novel lurches along for far too long before petering out, exhausted with itself. I've enjoyed Dunning's "Bookman" series, and I like historically set mysteries, so picking this up seemed like a no-brainer. But Dunning overextends himself with this one. The story revolves around Jack Dulaney, a down-and-out racetrack horse-walker who gets in a fight that lands him in jail. His buddy helps to spring him from a work gang, but is then killed. This is the catalyst for Jack's incredibly complicated search for the killer and reason behind the murder. The trail leads him to a New Jersey beach town and the radio station where his buddy used to work as an actor. There, further disappearances and deaths are revealed, including that of Carnahan, the father of the woman he pined for years before. As it happens, the woman is also in town, working as a nightclub singer under an assumed name. Jack manages to get work at the station as a writer, allowing him to poke around and try to get to the bottom of everything (not to mention rekindle his old flame).   Here is where the book starts to have real problems. Namely, all the detail about old-time radio production is far more fascinating than the murders. I'm not particularly (nor are most readers likely to be) interested in how dramatic radio shows were put together back in the '30s and '40s, but Dunning makes the station come alive and does a fascinating job of detailing the inner workings. From the scripting, to the management, the actors, the sound effects, it's all very well dramatized. So much so, in fact, that it's hard for the reader to care very much about the deaths of some characters met only very briefly or in flashbacks. The station's attempt to create original dramatic programming that pushed the limits of what was considered acceptable material--such as a scripted serial about black Americans, an anti-war prison camp series, and soforth--ends up being much more interesting. Unfortunately, the story eventually leaves the radio setting (via a lame piece of misdirection lifted from Hamlet) to dive into the world of German spies in America, the Irish Republic Army, and all manner of melodrama.  The melodrama is enhanced by a certain thinness to the characters. The protagonist is an especially poorly drawn hero figure with altogether too keen a resemblance to the hero of Dunning's "Bookman" series. He's one of those all-purpose strong, capable men. Street-fighting? No problem. Writing a critically well-received Steinbeck/Dos Passosesque novel? No problem. Escaping a work gang? No problem. Master writing radio drama overnight? No problem. Expert tracking through the woods? No problem. When the hero of a story turns out to be exceptional at everything, the whole story is diluted. Beyond Jack, the cast of characters is so large that Dunning doesn't really have the time or space to develop any of them in any meaningful way. It's not generally a good thing when the villain in a mystery is a character you can barely remember being in the story. This is a pity, because there are a number of characters with potential, and the old-time radio setting is certainly well done. As a historical novel about a small group of people striving in a creative field, it works fairly well--in no small part due to the subsequent total demise of the world depicted in the book. Just don't expect to pick this up and find yourself immersed in a thriller. 
 Two main comments.  Firstly, the book is mistitled or I misread the meaning of the title and I would be delighted to return it.  This is a book devoted primarily on how to make your dog perform "tricks" with much on showmanship.  I have no interest in that but I do have an acute interest in dog obedience relative to the master's care of their puppy and mature dog.  Problems handlers encounter in "greeting" of your dog with other dogs and people.   Secondly, the book, as written, talks down to the reader and unless you have had some professional experience with dogs, you feel very unqualified to read on.  I felt intimidated by it.  
 If this author did his research he would know that marriage has changed throughout history and it is a social construct. A good book to read is "Marriage, a History: From Obedience to Intimacy, or How Love Conquered Marriage". Look at history not the dogma that fits a moralistic perspective. , what are these people afraid of? Critical thinking? 
 Many errors in trading card section. Plus no mention what-so-ever of x-rated #207 card and also no mention of any Heritage card 
 This novel by G.K. Chesterton, starts very well, with a policeman so succesful in trying to infiltrate a group of anarchists that he is elected one of the bosses of the cell. Then things slowly becomes more muddled and the plot collapses halfway through the book, as it becomes more and more confusing and improbable and the author tries to feed on us too much indigestible philosophical baggage (Chesterton was a notorious political ultraconservative who seemed to find nothing worthwhile in the Europe after the Middle Ages). If you want to read a novel about early 20th century anarchists, I suggest instead you read Joseph Conrad's "The Secret Agent" 
 While most of the content of this book is helpful, it is a religious-based book "undercover."  The farther I got in the book, the more I felt that their own religious beliefs were in the way of their professionalism.  My respect for their ability to include all people's freedom of spirituality dwindled with every page.  If this is the kind of book it is, Authors, that's fine, but don't sneak in your own religion without advising your readers 
 As a fan of historical mysteries, I was looking forward to starting this popular series.  I was deeply disappointed.  First of all, the character of Amelia Peabody is not appealing, and through her the author reveals that she has only a very superficial understanding of Victorian values and thinking.  (Although if you don't mind an author sticking a character with modern sensibilities in period dress, maybe this is for you.)  Furthermore, the mystery was simply not that interesting.  I found myself reading only to finish the book, for I had little interest in finding out who committed the murders. The success of this series and the acclaim the author has received truly baffle me 
 I picked this book up after reading both Books in the Bartimeus Trilogy and was excited to see what else Jonathan Stroud could conjure up. This book was a let down. I just couldn't get into the plot. I even found the story somewhat disturbing and eerie, especially for young children to read. There are very evil characters in this book who would be much better suited for an adult sci-fi novel, rather than a book marketed for children and young teens. The characters were unlikeable, and the plot just never seemed to grab my attention. I was very dissapointed that this is from the same author who wrote the amazing Bartimeus trilogy books! Well, I figured I would add my two cents in and let people know I just didn't like this book 
 This book was'nt what I imagined it to be. It's virtually pure propaganda of Israeli intelligence and their military services. Samuel Katz takes a one sided view here and mostly describes the Israeli population suffering due to the suicide bombers destruction. He virtually ignores the fact on why the Palestinians resort to this method and does not inform the readers how the Israeli's murder of innocent civillians started the whole issue. Samuel Katz should have explored both sides of the issue well before writing this book. Furthermore, those wanting to know of how Israeli agents tracked the bomber would be dissapointed as the book largely focuses on Israeli politics. A bad buy to anyone interested. I would recommend "By Way Of Deception" by Victor Ostrovsky and "Gideon's Spies" by Gordon Thomas for a compelling read 
 Susan Estrich's argument for a Hillary Clinton Presidency seems to be divided into three parts. (A) She can win. (B) All those mean things people have been saying about her are lies. (C) If Hillary doesn't win, women are in for a world of hurt. There is nothing here that will convert anyone who is not already predisposed to support a Clinton Restoration. It reads like a lawyer's brief with inconvenient facts left out or glossed over. Still, it does provide a window into the mind of a Clintonista who clearly has been champing at the bit to get back into power after eight years of the Bush Terror. Sad, in a way. Horrifying when one thinks about the number of people who will buy the argument without criticism 
 In Sylvia's third book of her Journey of the Soul series I felt her message was really starting to get diluted.  By time I finished this book I began to get the feeling that it was written just to sell more books.  Much of it was information repeated from the other books, with a few more stories added from her own experience.  It is also filled with countless meditations which all basically are used for the same purpose.  To cleanse the soul, heal, and rid it of negativity.  I get the feeling she is going to come out with a book of meditations which, once again will be gathered from those in this series.  This will add to her pocket book nicely.  But before you get the impression I think this is all about greed let me say that I agree with many of her tenants, which was why I continued to read her books.  Some of these include the fact that God exists in all of us, we do not need an intermediary to reach God, and that we all create our own Hell on earth.  Some of the inconsistancies I found in the book stand out like a sore thumb.  For one, on page 120 she quotes Genesis 1:26 "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness."  She uses this quote to support the idea that Mother God and Father God both exist, not just a male God.  Thus the Our, and Us, in the quote.  But then on page 122 she goes on to say "The Old Testament is a collection of teaching stories, but certainly not the word of God.  So, my question is which way is it?  Are we suppose to take this literal interpretation in Genesis as the Word of God?  There is also a false statement on page 110 when she is refering to her church she says "This is the first time in 2000 years that we're merging a belief in reincarnation into Christianity."  This is not true at all since Charles Fillmore, over 100 years ago became a co-founder of Unity faith which does indeed merge the two.  A strange statement from a woman who claims to be such a student of Religions of various faiths.  In conclusion I don't dismiss all she says but she is beginning to get a bit stale.  It is a fairly good book if you are curius enough 
 Recently I got into a conversation with the guy next to me on the plane about some of the memorable books we had each read in the past few years.  Unfortunately, I had to recall `Confidence'-easily the worst book I've read in years.  To describe it as disappointing is to go easy on Ms. Kanter.  It is far beyond that, and altogether abominable and embarrassing.  That such a prestigious business school like Harvard can tenure a professor who writes such insipid pablum boggles the mind.  Let's start with the central (and only) idea of the book--that winning begets winning and losing begets losing.  This of course strikes most people as fairly straightforward and unworthy of a book's worth of elaboration.  Yet Ms. Kanter tumbles all over herself to spell out the details: why this is the case (as if someone with an ounce of inferential ability couldn't figure it out in a couple of minutes), how it affects team morale, how it self-perpetuates, etc...  And worst of all, endless, endless, endless examples that do nothing or very little to elucidate; rather, they simply restate what has just been said.  And they restate and restate and restate.  Tautological (I think the word was invented in anticipation of this book), boring, tedious, insipid, stupid, unthoughtful, unenergetic, disengaged, disrespectful.  All these adjectives apply forcefully to the book.  Most of all, though, it is utterly uninventive and cliched.  Turn to any page and you'll find such gems of penetrating insight as (forgive me, but these are so funny I have to quote at length):   "Winning feels good, and good moods are contagious.  Success makes it easier to view events in a positive light, to generate optimism.  It produces energy and promotes morale.  It is easier to aim high and expect to reach the target."  (P. 29)  "Overcoming obstacles, leaping over hurdles, and recovering from fumbles can strengthen a team that has the discipline not to panic under pressure." (P. 71)  "Once the 'loser' label gets slapped on, those suffering losses are set up to fail.  They find it harder to get support, harder to get opportunities." (P. 115)  "Various turnaround tasks operate on different clocks.  Bold strokes are fast and can be done by one powerful person; long marches to change culture and behavior take more time and the commitment of many people.  Execution is play by play, game by game, while strategy is season by season..." (P. 178)  "People embodying the pathologies of the past can always be replaced, but eliminating the bad does not automatically produce the good.  It takes a major effort on the part of leaders to foster confidence that a demoralized company or group is capable of working together and succeeding at it.  Restoring people's (sic) confidence in one another requires four kinds of action..." (P. 241)  "Confidence is an expectation of a positive outcome, but what happens when outcomes are negative?  The dividing line between winning streaks and losing streaks is the choice of behavior in response to setbacks...  That decision to build rather than retreat, to rally rather than get discouraged, involves viewing setbacks through an optimistic lens, as an opportunity to learn and move on." (P. 357)  And it just goes on and on, mercilessly and cluelessly.   The wisest, most incisive business people read, study and think about far more than just sports and business.  I would recommend Ms. Kanter first enroll in a decent freshman-level literature or history seminar.  There she can learn to write and, with some effort on her part and perhaps a bit of luck, to formulate some imaginative approaches to problem-solving.  Beyond this bilge, I have had the good fortune to come across many books that have helped address confidence.  These are: selected essays by Montaigne and Emerson, `Hamlet', Whitman's "Song Of Myself", David Herbert Donald's biography `Lincoln', `Emotional Intelligence', `Flow', and Jack Welch's `Winning'.  `Confidence' inspires confidence only in the realization that you (no matter who you are) are at least intelligent enough to be the "Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor" at Harvard Business School 
 Only worked for a couple days.  Wouldn't spend my money on it again 
 Can anybody explain how "Til I Loved You" got left out of this compilation?  Where is "Wheels"?  I think "Mending Fences" would have made more sense than the inclusion of the last two songs.  Save your money and download the tunes you want from elsewhere - this cd isn't worth the price, and is hardly all of Restless Heart's greatest hits 
 Is this the best the right has to offer when it comes to humor?   No wonder the best comedians are always liberals 
 This book is a rip-off. There is no new information in it. It purports to give unique insights, when all it does is rehash conventional wisdom. 
 My roommate gave me this book and I thought it would be a good read during the winter break (I am a college student).  Halfway through chapter 2 (pg 18) I decided to stop reading the book. The book can be summarized by saying that we human make decisions based on feeling and not logic. This book explains why is that. But it doesn't teach you how to become more logical 
 The first twenty pages of the book quickly sparks your interest but soon after that, the story drags until it picks back up again toward the last third of the book.  I think the story would have been more credible if Barr would have thoroughly explored the inner workings of her fictional religious sect and offered more details about it.  Without those details, the book seemed "unfinished".  It was like watching a movie and only viewing the actions of the good guy without being exposed to villain.  Boring in my opinion.                                                                                                                                                                                            
 I bought these skates for my daughter from Sport Authority.  Since we both wear the same size, I decided I would try and skate in them after my daughter.  She complained the wheels would not roll and when I tried to loosen them with a skate tool, they wouldn't loosen at all.  I tried to skate in them as well and I almost fell on my face.  I wasn't expecting the same quality as my professional skates, but at least hoped for skates that rolled safely! 
 Ok, other than the one identity twist anyone with a brain picks up on after 75 pages or so, this book will bore you to death... it could easily have been written in 1940 (although it pales to the Masters of that time, Heinlein/Asimov/etc.).  Not a single character took any action/inaction which surprised me in the entire book.  It's like they all had tunnel vision.  And humor is (nearly) entirely absent.  I would have somewhat enjoyed the basic "war story" premise up to age 14 or so.  So that age group -- ignore this review, your homones will compel you to enjoy any man vs. bug fightin' story.  I did finish the book (barely), but won't be reading the sequel.   
 I think this book marginalized and almost ignored the most important case in human rights and human rights violations. Where is the Israeli-Palestinians case and why it's missing from Mr. Schulz book, is it because it will show the obvious contradiction between what USA says and what it actually do. What happens when the interests of the United States collides with the human rights. These question and many others needs answers in order to support the arguments made by the author 
 At First When I Got It, It Seemed Fun.  Then As The Minutes Go By It Got Boring Quick.  The Missions Suck, The Bosses Are Too Hard.  I Just Sold My Game,  If You Buy This Game You'll Be Doing The Sam 
 My 3-year-old loves this book, so I bought him a new copy to replace his tattered old one. I highly recommend this book, which is delightful, especially for train-loving little ones. This edition, however, was poorly edited, in my opinion. The illustrations don't match up with the words. The sentences break up in the middle of the page. Anyone who reads to children knows that they enjoy pointing at pictures and anticipating the next event. However, it's very confusing for them when the words and pictures aren't in synch. I bought him another version that had other little blue engine stories, and it was a big hit. 
 I don't get it. There is no story, just a meandering. While I was hoping to be drawn in to a vivid life of ocean hardship and island comforts, it is just kind of drab.  The pages are easy to turn, and she writes nicely. I realized half way through the book that it was going nowhere. I finished it anyway, hoping for some insight or revelation. There was none, except of course for the map that appears at the end, too lately revealed for it to serve it's function 
 This book is extremely challenging to get through and understand.  I was lost a great deal of the time and did not learn what I had hoped.  I appreciate the inclusion of the spiritual aspects of theories in the book, but the authors seemed to forget about teaching in an understandable manner 
 Where to begin?  Cliched. Pretentious. Flat. Static. Maudlin. Melodramatic. Homophobic. And finally, just plain BORING.  Start with an over-the-top caricature of a deaf-mute Patsy Cline young drag queen arriving the big city, pile on cardboard "colorful" characters like typical AIDS patient, porno star, and loud-mouthed Latina hot mamna, and whaddya get?  An amateur film populated with some of the most UNLIKABLE, UNATTRACTIVE characters ever, all spewing some of the unbelievably BAD dialogue ever written - and to think the (formerly talented) director made THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD also with D'Onofrio? Go figure.  Nice cover art, though 
 The moment I saw the cover of this newly published book, I immediately went to the cash register and bought myself a copy. I mean, even the title sounds cool.."Raised By Wolves". Yet, when I began reading this book, I was wondering where all of this writing was going.   The author, Jerome Charyn, seems to have only a wide knowledge of vocabulary that makes it sound like he knows what he is talking about. And at the same time, I feel as if he writes on purpose only to confuse the reader with all this filmic and post-modernist gibble gabble that really, if you try to think about it, doesn't make too much sense.  I wanted a detailed story about Tarantino's life as a youth, how he became the person he is today. What influences he had, what things he did to mold him into a film director, etc. There were bits and pieces yes, but I feel as if there was too much confusion around his aimless commentary and analysis to make it worthwhile to read 
 The book is full of nonsense that should be simple common sense to anyone that has worked in the business world.  Mostly this book is a chance for the author to talk of his many "high level" meetings and for him to boast about all of the execs and sports figures that he knows.  This book is rather entertaining, but you will not gain much from it in the way of business or management knowledge 
 It's not that it's boring.  It's that it's an advertisement. I recieved this book as a freebee with the holosync prologue.  It's got some nice information which is why it's so annoying that the author has to mention how great his program is and why you should get it just about every 5 sentances.  I'm up to chapter 3 and I just can't take anymore.  If you have the patience to read the constant commercial I guess it's a good book. 
 This will only please the most ardent vampire fans.  Why?  It's exceedinly poorly written.  I figured when I watched it it would either be a decent movie or so bad that it wouldn't matter.  Sadly it was neither.  Don't get me wrong, it was bad, but in all of the wrong ways.  For example the writing, plot dialog, character development is basically not there...well they are they're just about as interesting as chalk.  Unfortunately the acting's not bad.  This results in what must be the worst kind of bad movie.  You can't laugh at the bad dialog because it isn't bad enough, it's just flat.  And you can't laugh at the poor acting because for the most part it's acceptable.  It's got gore and blood, but it isn't the least bit scary.  In general my accessment is it is bad in the most painfully mediocre and forgetable way.  if you want sexy evil wait for the remake of Amityville Horror to be released.  Ryan Reynolds may not play a vampire, but that movie had more development in it's credits than this had in it's entirety 
 I bought this book because it claimed to have a lot of case studies on performance management's impact on organizations with programs in place.  I did not find that to be the case.  I would not recommend this book if you're looking for real life examples of how an effective PM program translates to improved business results. 
 I read this book and was very disappointed. For the price, it gives all the same information that every other stripper book out there does. For the price you can buy 5 other books by dancers, who wrote thier own books, and be much happier with your purchase. Not worth the money... And couldn't the author come up with her own title, Stripped, is already used.. 
 If you take the time to write a biography of a person, isn't it part of one's research to interview their wife? Donya Fiorentino was married to or lived with David Fincher for 5 years and gave him a daughter. When they met, he was directing Pepsi commercials, and when they split up, he was an auteur. For some reason, Sharon Waxman made no effort to interview or contact Donya, and dismisses her in two sentences as an alcoholic and drug addict. In fact, Donya has been sober for 6 years, is a brilliant and creative photographer who has an edgy side to the Fincher story that has never been told. I know the truth; as Donya's physician I have heard her compelling story. Waxman also does not mention that after their divorce, she married Gary Oldman. This was written with my patient's permission, who was very hurt by this book's publication 
 The service was great I recieved my package within a week, but when i opened it i noticed that the book was damaged due to the poor handling. I guess if your looking to just have the guide for reference then you won't have a problem but if you want it for keeps then you might want to order it with some bigger stuff so it doesn't get damaged on the way 
 This is not a George A. Romero project. Directed and written by Ken Wiederman. Film contains profane language, gross bloody effects.   Thom Matthews returns as a different character, "Joey", James Karen returns as a different character, "Ed", Jonathan Terry returns as "Glover", Allan Trautman returns as "Tarman". Brian Peck returns as 5 different zombies, "Pussface", "Thriller", "Jaw", "Eye-Pop" and the zombie on the car roof.   A truck that is traveling across a bridge is carrying pressurized cases that contain cadavers.  One case falls off the truck and ends up in the water.  A group of kids find the case and triggers the gas inside that spreads across the cemetary.  The living dead return.   Also in the cast: Thor van Lingen, Dana Ashbrook, Mitch Pileggi. DVD only contains audio commentary and theatrical trailer 
 I agree with "music fan" about this CD. Eden is a good album, and she's a good artist. But either this album was poorly produced or something, because this does not show her best. I wouldn't classify this as world music at all, because the instruments aren't used and it's more classical pop; if that's a genre. It seemed rambly to me with many of the songs sounding similar and lacking originality. I love her, she's unique in her genre. But she really shines as a classicist, with Classics, her work by Andrew Lloyd Webber (who she married) and operatic albums. This is what she's best at, so her collaborations on Eden and La Luna, which are classical in nature but still allowed her to branch out musically, turned out good. I have a lot of her albums, but I wouldn't buy this one. It's more something to listen to once. A few of the songs are good, the album isn't terrible, but it's not very good 
 I'm sure it was fun for Van to record a bunch of songs he likes, but overall this would have made for a disappointing bootleg.  Thanks for all the great music through The Healing Game.  All good times have to come to an end 
 This book started out well, although the disfigured model theme has been done already, and done much better by other authors.  The thing that killed this book for me was the overuse of the word "egregious" which became such a nuisance to me that I couldn't finish the book.  The author uses the word in places where it shouldn't be used, as if she doesn't know the meaning of it but liked the sound.  Teenagers who wouldn't have this kind of vocabulary use this word constantly in this book.  I'm also displeased by her depiction of both women and men as sexual objects and nothing else.  All in all, disappointing 
 well, namely, my copy is missing pages 361-392... but I suppose to make up for it they included two copies of pages 393-424. It would have been a pretty good review text but for the omission. kind of expensive for a book with this kind of F'up 
 Why? Because it underestimates our intelligence! It has nothing to do with natural health. It has to do with advertisements. It is empty, completelly. More: it looks like a woman magazine but I believe that a clever woman would feel like I feel now, angry! I paid for something that I believed but it is not. OK, we make mistakes 
 I was extremely disappointed with this book.  The only thing this book gave me was the notion that action makes everything happen.  Trouble is, I already knew that, and I bought the book to learn more about it, and perhaps gain new insights to enhance my life's actions.   It seems Ringer has patched together a bunch of disparate ideas which are all supposed to be related to "action", but really they are just conventional wisdom forced to fit what his book is (supposed to be) about.  A perfect example is his chapter "People Taxes and Action".  He talks about all sort of "people taxes" (people who tax your ability to act), such as "The Evilness Tax" (evil people), "The Dishonesty Tax" (dishonest people), and "The Negativism Tax" (negative people).  The conventional wisdom he offers is basically this: avoid evil, dishonest, and negative people, as they will get in the way of your ability to act.  I found this chapter, and the book in general, trite and patronizing.  This book was not even close to what I expected based on the reviews I read before buying it.  I am suspicious of all the glowingly positive reviews about this book.  My strong recommendation is to leaf through it in a bookstore or library before you buy it, to make sure it is what you are expecting.  I sure wish I had 
      I was offended from the first page of this book written by a psychiatrist, whose theory trivializes the emotional, aesthetic and intellectual (not to mention fun) qualities of collecting by reducing the pursuit to "compulsive action molded by irrational impulses." The author interprets the acquisition of objects "as a powerful help in keeping anxiety or uncertainty under control." This anxiety is ostensibly caused by "underlying factors" such as "war, a parent's suicide, prolonged illness, physical handicaps, death of a sibling, or SIMPLY NOT-GOOD-ENOUGH early care."       With this tunnel-vision approach, Muensterberger proceeds to relate anecdotes of famous collectors' lives and interpret them as compulsive and unconscious behaviors to alleviate neuroses. The text is padded with details about the rich and famous: Balzac was a collector of "bric a brac," a hobby described as deriving from childhood suffering. The collecting habits of Holy Roman Emperor Rudolph II are similarly reduced to "anal-obsessive character traits." Getty, Duveen and a plethora of historical fugues litter the text. This book is a classic example of psychoanalytic gibberish, probably originating from the author's doctoral thesis, based on the number of footnotes.       Ultimately, there is no argument here related to collecting that could not equally apply to any human behavior. Thus, there is no argument at all. As any educated person knows, it is all to easy to take an erroneous theory and find lots of examples to support it. As a former curator at a top ten museum, I think I am more familiar with collectors than the author. As a collector myself, I know that collecting is a happy, positive and enriching experience. Jeanette Hanisee Gabriel  
 I was forced to suffer through this rubbish in a college class. This book is merely propaganda packaged under a thin dust jacket of objectivity. The arguments are weak and contrived. Said seems to be just another appologetic for Islamic barbarism. The very premise for the book seems irrelevant -unfair potrayal of Islam in the western press. It's the very typical "don't believe what you see, believe what I say" sort of drivel that only appeals to mindless drones in dusty lands 
  I have given Skinner's book I star, because it was required to write a review. I consider its ideas dangerous - for the simple reason that it represents a frontal assault upon our ideas of freedom and human dignity.    　Of course, Skinner doesn't see anything 'sinister' in his ideas. He simply takes it for granted that our notion that we have 'interior selves' and are autonomous (i.e. free agents) - is largely an illusion. In short, Skinner's argument (and it just that, not a statement of fact, as he would have us believe) - is that we are wholly determined in our lives by environmental factors, which is to say - 'conditioned' by forces outside ourselves.    Skinner's argument, then, is that we might as well accept this and make the most of it. Rather than resisting the idea of conditioning, he thinks we should perfect it. In short, if there is nothing more than external conditioning and learned behaviour, then we might as well have social scientists maximising our potential to live with the learned behaviour.    The fallacy of Skinner's argument, is that the notion of human freedom and dignity rests upon scientifically 'unprovable' or 'unverifiable' assertions. When we look, we cannot find a 'ghost in the machine' - and thus, we might as well accept the machine. But it is a facile argument. The fact that we cannot reduce our interior selves to a scientifically quantifiable formula, is the very reason why it remains of vital importance to human life. Its resistence to reductive, strictly empirical formulas, is what makes human nature special. Nobody sensible would deny that childhood experience is highly formative, or that certain genetic determinants are at work, or that empirically speaking, we are conditioned in our external lives. But we have no reason to suppose that these factors are ALL determining.    Needless to say, Skinner's thinking was informed by wholly secular ideas of social and scientific progress - much as if we could get behind everything and 'push.' Paradoxically, Skinner never gave that much thought to who controls the controllers! Skinner wasn't thinking of anything like Soviet style dialectical materialism - but, if we wanted a graphic example of how things go painfully wrong by regimenting human nature and trying to educate people out of the idea that they have 'interior selves' - well, the failures of the Soviet Union (or Communist China) tell us all we need to know.    I don't say this with any illusions that captalism and 'free markets' per se, are intrinsically more respectful of human freedom and dignity. Those values hinge upon something deeper, and without that, there is little to prevent a 'market oriented' society drifting into social controls and abuses of human nature, no less than those which drove the Soviet system.      Ironically, some reviewers have adduced Buddhist teachings(i.e. the doctrine of anatman = no-self) as further confirmation of Skinner's ideas. But Buddhism only denies that there is a permanent self in the skandhas or aggregates - a materialistic self. In fact, the Buddha taught people to take refuge in the 'self' and the Dharma as an inner lamp. Buddhists do have 'interior' lives. Moreover, the Buddha accorded 'dignity' to human nature, or manusya- as the 'most noble of two footed beings.'    It is not anyone else's business to define what we are - in any final or absolute sense. Those who would endeavour to do so are of the same mind as those who would patent the human genome,and plan on engineering an improved version of the human race in their laboratories. The chances are that those who would play 'God' will end up doing the devil (or Mara's) work. As the Rolling Stones song said: - "Hey - you! Get offa maa cloud! "  
 In 1978, when film critic Roger Ebert interviewed Irwin Allen, the mega-producer suggested a potential story idea for a planned sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure"...The survivors of the Poseidon disaster would be rescued and taken to land in Italy where they would be placed on a train which would go through a tunnel in the Alps. The tunnel would collapse and everyone would be trapped under the mountain. Ebert thought it was an excellent idea. And as it turns out Mr. Allen should have went with it. Because the movie he wound up making is an idiotic waste of time; ranks among the worst sequels ever made; and marked the beginning of the end of Allen's reign as the "Master of Disaster." Side note: Allen directed this mess and, as "Beyond TPA" star Michael Caine said in his autobiography, good ol' Irwin should have stuck to producing! Worth a look for "Poseidon" fans, but that's about it. 
 Listening to Gieseking play Debussy is like listening to a pianist who sat at his instrument with the composer's score stripped of all dynamic markings and performance instructions and interpreted what he saw like it were Beethoven. There are crescendos where there shouldn't be crescendos and violent and sharply biting outbursts in passages where Debussy is asking of the pianist the most gentle and delicate touch possible. I'm not saying Gieseking isn't a phenomenal pianist from a technical standpoint, but he displays so little regard for the composer's intentions. By all means, buy this record if you want to hear Gieseking, but not if you want to hear Debussy 
 The book suppresses a lot of unfortunate injustices that happened to our Jewish neighbors and friends in Cairo.  To this day, I remember clearly how our neighbors' two sons from across the street were dragged by the police into a van.  My mother and I were watching out of the window, and I recall my mother crying.  Within a few days, we learned that all Egyptian Jewish men were incarcerated in Abu Za'abal prison and tortured.  Our neighbors left the country a few months later, and we never knew what happened to their son.   None of this is mentioned in the book.  The period 1967-70 is omitted, and that is dishonest 
 ROBOT MONSTER is one of "those" classic Five Star One Star '50s horror movies. The problem with "C" movies is that they can't be rated by the usual standards. By its own standards its a gem.   But for the fact that this gobbler wasn't touched by Ed Wood it has all the guaranteed elements of bad moviemaking. Actually, ROBOT MONSTER was panned so severely upon release that director Phil Tucker attempted suicide afterward.  ROBOT MONSTER concerns the depredations of a fat gorilla-suited space alien in a diving helmet (Ro-Man from the planet Ro-Man which is populated by the race of Ro-Mans) who comes to earth and destroys virtually all of human life with the aid of a vacuum tube radio and a Lawrence Welk bubble machine.  Ro-Man is a grouchy, slow moving space visitor who talks with his hands and grumbles a lot. He lives in one of the more familiar Hollywood caves of Bronson Canyon, California.   The few surviving humans (a family of five) protect themselves by stringing aluminum foil around their house so that Ro-Man cannot use his death ray machine against them. Instead, he must dispose of them one at a time "by the process of strang-u-laaa-tion" if they are so foolish as to step outside of their Reynolds Wrap safety zone.    Given their current world political situation, the humans, Richard Nixon-like, are seeking "Peace---But peace with honor!" from Ro-Man. Hmmm. Seems reasonable. After all, Ro-Man has really shown restraint up until this point. Why shouldn't they trust him?    But wait! Even after atomizing everybody else (apparently including the film's scriptwriter) Ro-Man has developed a penchant for Alice, the eldest daughter of the survivors. Fortunately for us, Alice seems to have a corresponding yen for excessively hirsute and overweight men wearing fishbowls on their heads. So while Ro-Man is distracted picking a bouquet for his new girlfriend, the family figures out a way to finally finish him off.    Exactly how humanity is going to repopulate the earth with only the Father Knows Best kids around escapes me, but clearly someone involved with this film escaped from somewhere.  It's as bad and as much fun as it sounds.   
 The Complete Scoundrel is more of a frosty rose icing to an already overdecorated cake which are the Complete Handbooks. We get a rundown of 'scoundrels, from literature, movies, and tv but it's never a good idea to base one of your PCs entirely off an already existing character no matter the medium. We also get another slew of prestige classes, very few of which had any appeal to me and I doubt my players will have much interest in them. Next up are the Luck Feats which really seem to be stretching the limits and pretty much eliminates the bonuses you get of other class features (sneak attack taking the biggest hit) but it could provide good flavor description with an imaginative DM when such a Luck Feat is used. What interests me most in this book are the Luck Skill Abilities which allows someone to build up quirks/traits using skill points. Finally comes the new 'scoundrel' spells, again, few of which intrigue me enough to really bother with. I had some real hope for this book but once again, it falls short of expectations and seems ground out of the Complete... series forging machine 
 Do not buy this DVD as it is a total waste of money,Joe Walsh can be heard on a much better DVD with Eagles Farewell 1 Melbourne,Au. This DVD DOES NOT have DTS 5.1 Audio format as advertised 
 Before you vote this review down, I ask that you fully read it, so you can understand why Sin City does not function as a good film.  Sin City unfortunately is an absolute mess.  I sat down to watch this provocative disaster about a year ago, and it has stuck with me ever since.  It has lingered for so long because it is representative of everything that could possibly go wrong with a production such as this.  I am fan of Robert Rodriguez's directing. I also absolutely love everything that Quentin Tarantino has cranked out since his inception as a director.  I grew up with interest in the occasional Frank Miller graphic novel.  This is why it is so sad that Sin City fails on so many levels.  Within the first 23 minutes of watching this film, I was praying that it would be over soon.  I only stuck it out so I could one day write this review.  Let's break it down to its most basic levels.  The film has great directors, great actors, a great story, and a great production design.  With all of this going for it, one expects "Sin City" to be a landmark movie experience, and it is -- though, for me, the experience is a negative one, and the attainment it achieves is in the depths of pointless, mean-spirited exploitation.  The film tells three stories (with a fourth vignette as a framing device): Bruce Willis battling a child-molesting monster; Mickey Rourke as an ugly hulk out to avenge a girlfriend's murder; and Clive Owen as a private eye helping a band of imperiled hookers.  The three segments transpire more or less in sequence (with some confusing overlapping) and all take place in Sin City: a super-corrupt, super-violent, super-shadowy, and in every other way super-exaggerated caricature of a '40s Hollywood film-noir world.  It's a caricature of a caricature.  No one would ever confuse this world with reality. The heroes shake off multiple gunshot wounds, devastating blows to the head and other lethal overtures like slaps on the cheek; the hookers all look like Victoria's Secret models; the scenes are ugly day dreams.  And, to be fair, the stylish blend of CGI- exoticism and continual chaos generates a certain visual fascination. Sin City, however, can't sustain it, and after the first segment it's hard to imagine how anyone could find its trashy excess anything but tedious, obnoxious, and repetitive.  Everything that happens in the movie is an calculated cliche. The stories have a minimal narrative drive or interest, the banter is banal pseudo-Raymond-Chandler babble and the performances are as shallow as most "SNL" skits these days.  Rodriguez is rather vain because of his pride in the way his movie so faithfully bows to the "genius" of Miller and re-creates his comic-book world with the same kind of religious devotion Gus Van Sant paid to Hitchcock with his frame-for-frame "Psycho" remake.  Is comic-book art some special invention that deserves such recognition? Aren't movies already enough like dumb comic books without actually trying to BE one?  Though it's not immediately obvious, "Sin City" is a comedy, and its aspiration is to pull off the Tarantino trick of making its audience wearily laugh at the outrageousness of its sadism at the same time it subtly gets off on it sexually.  And it's out to one-up Tarantino by basking in the pornography of brutality on a large scale, a giddy spectacular in which we sit back like Romans at the Coliseum watching people being decapitated, disemboweled, dismembered, castrated and humiliated.  Check out Fellini's Satyricon if that is what you are really after.  The publicity has made a big deal about what a "risky" commercial venture this is, and how heroic it was for Rodriguez to insist on putting Miller's name in the title and above his own in the directing credits. But this all stinks of the worst Hollywood insincerity.  For one thing, can anyone doubt that such a violent, low-budget movie with such a lineup of stars will make a ton of money? Given the distance "Sin City" pushes the envelope to on sick movie violence, and given the recent Columbine-like massacres, such a backlash from the Christian right and other voices for movie censorship seems likely (and Rodriguez may even be hoping for it).  I don't support these voices for a minute: I don't believe in censorship and I don't think movies motivate mass murder. But I do think that a film like this, especially one made by a major director under the flag of artistic integrity, adds something ugly to the air for which critics must hold it accountable.  Sitting through the thing, watching scene after scene in which I was being asked to be entertained by the spectacle of helpless people being tortured, I kept thinking of all the other horrible acts that are being committed today and how we, as an American society are taught to think that it is all so gruesome and atrocious.  I suppose some people don't find it that bad. "Sin City" is their movie. 
 "Customers who bought this item also bought ...". That's the bit that is easily overlooked when one orders that item. Once the toy arrives you will be surprised to know that a number of accessories are also needed. It takes a lot of time to finding some, and a lot more creative thinking for others (gravel!). And then this compound starts getting highly educational as you have to teach the child to handle his/her birthday present the way a nurse would normally deal with patients under intensive care. The whole thing is a little disappointing overall. An actual comment about this item was nothing les than "this package sure is nice". Maybe the idea is interesting, but will offer more headaches than fun to your family 
 It really sucks, tried to download but it's not able to be viewed in pc's outsided the united states. Crikey. I'll have to wait for reruns to watch it on the telly. Whatta shame amazon dot com. Let's send a CSI to yer headquarters 
 I purchased this book because of the several glowing reviews of it on Amazon.  Now that I have a copy (which I will be returning shortly) I can only guess that those reviews were written by friends of the author. This book is little more but a long and rambling antidotal collection of PC repair stories roughly organized into general failing areas.  No symptom analysis, no error code explanations, no organized flowcharts of logical procedures, no tables of settings and types.  Just paragraph after paragraph of "if you notice this, try that".  In my mind this should be called something like the "Jeff Foxworthy you might be a redneck PC repair tech manual". However, if you are new to PC repair and have no idea where to start looking for the resolution of a problem, this MIGHT be just the book you need - because you can sit and thumb through it and look like you are doing something useful while you await the arrival of the guy who knows what he's doing.  You might even stumble on an antidote that actually applies to the problem you are currently experiencing 
 I read this book in 2002 way before the Iraq invasion seemed probable.  After reading it (and believing that I was reading thorough reporting) I supported going after the WMD in Iraq.  However, now that we've seen how Judy can manipulate facts and her proven track record with no WMD found in Iraq I strongly suggest you read this book with a skepticism to truthfulness.  Some of the non-Iraq WMD reporting was very interesting and I learned a bit from that, but how do I separate fact from fiction?  As a result of being 100% wrong in her reporting and Judy's recent comments, "the analysts, the experts and the journalists who covered them -- we were all wrong," which is not true (read John MacArthur, Ian Williams and Joby Warrick), I think this book loses its credibility.  You may want to read it just to attempt to discern fact v. fiction 
 Come on men...this album just sucks.   This is one of the worst recordings in his long time carreer. Now we understand why he kept on publishing live albums and collections in recent times instead of brand new songs. If this is the result i would rather stand for another "Best of..." of this rocker from Zocca, Italy.  Five stars are just five times too much.  Avoid it like chicken pox 
 In many ways, this Beowulf is a lot of fun for kids.  The writing is direct and clear (although there are plenty of vocabulary stretchers).  The action is fun.  Beowulf's heroism is unquestionable.  But, I don't understand why one would publish a Beowulf retelling and stay just close enough to the original to be confusing (as opposed to John Gardner's wonderful Grendel, which told the story from the monster's perspective).  The most disturbing divergence was making Unferth a petty bad guy in enamored of evil.  In doing so, Nye sacrifices much of the nobility of the original.   I don't know if there are other kid-friendly tellings of this story.  But, I would look for one of those, first 
 My mother gave me this book and her first cookbook, too.  Hard to believe, but this book seems worse than the first one.  She must get paid a bazillion dollars by the Processed Food Association because no one in their right mind would use so much crappy processed food in their recipes.  She seems totally oblivious to the fact that fresh food is available in her regular supermarket and that its just as easy to use in recipes 
 In this book, Lessing has an ax to grind against the kids--so noisy, so dirty, so infuriatingly idealistic about the left politics she herself has abandoned.  Naturally those idealistic kids are really thieves, liars, manipulative, clinically crazy, and...terrorists!  Lessing is a writer strongly motivated by spite, particularly spite against ideas about which she has become disillusioned.  (In fact, she has some very interesting things to say about the functions of spite in parts of the Golden Notebook.)  Unlike her disillusioned writing about the left in the Children of Violence cycle and the Golden Notebook, this book contains not one person who is both an ordinary, functional human being and a person who seriously believes that society can be improved--and even her disillusioned former-liberal characters have rolled over to Thatcherism with such feeble excuses about the laziness and pettiness of the youth!  Her villains are laughably crazy and manipulative--at least the villainous left wingers in the Golden Notebook were complex enough that you could understand their power.  (An awful lot of people who have never done political activism or met a left-wing person read this book and assume that it really depicts the world of activists, because people who don't really care too much about politics assume that those who do are crazy zealots.)  Lessing's other, better work shows that world more accurately in both its bright and dark aspects. (On that note, I feel that Lessing has written herself out about the left by the end of the Children of Violence cycle--later, wonderful books like Diary of a Good Neighbor and merely very good books like Mara and Dan deal with new issues.  One of the amazing things about Doris Lessing is that where many writers go through one or at most two big themes/phases in their writing careers, she has gone through, oh, four or five.) 
 This review covers only the Gateway Movie Classics edition, softcover, 1999.  What a thrill to revisit this gripping story that I enjoyed in childhood so much. Good writing, excellent story-telling, if you're not too squeamish to tolerate late 19th century colonialist literature.  But skip this edition. Mainly because of the numerous typos scattered inanely through the book...periods dropped into the middle of sentences, rogue exclamation points, and words inaccurately transcribed as though an original text had been OCR scanned without any professional quality checking. Inexusable in a professional publication. And, frankly, I don't think the movie is all that great, so the cover photo of a film version Quatermain doesn't do much for me.  Get another edition 
 Sorry, but I found this book a total waste of time. I never did like the main character - I found HER boring! I laughed out loud when I read another reviewer say that "this person escaped her life to be a secretary?" - good point! It was just so unbelievable a woman would leave her children without any thought really - and to continue this "new" life without really taking time to search her soul. Instead she befriends even more boring people than herself.As far as the ending of the book goes - I couldn't have cared less what happened to her anyway! After reading it (book on tape) I felt I had totally wasted my time. What a disappointment 
 My reaction to this book was the eventual impetus to just go out and purchase other books on meditation because the style and approach of the author were so irksome to me. I bought it because of the simple eloquence of the cover and the title, and I think I did read the first page when I was in the store. It looked straightforward, and I did indeed want to learn simply "how to meditate", being a beginner. (I subsequently learned that there are actually a few books called "how to meditate".)   I felt it was important to write a review because there seem to be so many positive ones, and it seems a book that may work for some, but for some like me, it's a real turn-off, although fortunately for me I just resolved to look for other meditation books (I've been using the "Getting in the Gap" meditation most extensively, and been trying to read a couple other books). There are a few reasons I wanted to learn how to meditate... one of them being the hope of maybe experiencing moments of deep insight or contact with something mystical or angelic, and at one point the author actually more or less actually discourages this aspect of meditation. He specifically refers to the possibility of these types of experiences during meditation, saying that you can just basically ignore it and keep going with the meditation, because these aren't the important part of meditation. It would seem to me if you had a mystical experience during meditation it would be something important enough to pay attention to, whether "real" or not.   This annoyed me, but my disagreement with that view was not so much the problem, as the consistent authoritarian and absolute style of his teachings on meditation. He seemed so focused on the shoulds and shouldn'ts of the whole discipline, which to me in a way is sort of going against the whole notion of meditation, and it made me put the book down. I did his first breathing exercise, which was fine, and I tried to go on with the book, but the style of his teaching was too much for me. It was annoying because the cover looks so elegant and zen-like and then what was inside, to me, seemed at odds with that.   Basically, if an an air of finality in an instructive book on meditation doesn't appeal to you, then you may want to read-before-you-buy. Because of my frustration with it, I was only able to get 15 pages or so into it, so I can't say much to the teachings of the book, only the way in which it was presented 
 	While I realize that many readers enjoy approaching a topic through the author's personal experiences, people like myself will find much of this book self indulgent.    	Other parts of the book deal with the things like the adoption community (see the Families With Children From China website instead),   and the single child policy.    As a long time member of  Zero Population Growth I can hardy be impartial on the latter, but why spend an entire chapter on the single child policy if later on you are going to say that gender ratios in India are even worse?   	 	I expect that one of the target audiences for this book is parents deciding whether or not to adopt from China.  While I myself would strongly recommend it,   I am also one of the parents the book mentions for whom the lack of identifiable birth parents was a major selling point.  Of course, many adoptive parents have the opposite desire, and perhaps they might consider places like Korea or Guatemala (Obviously domestic would be even better for those adoptive parents, but it might be considered impossible).    My Korean niece and nephew know what city their biological parents are from, their occupation and why they were given up for adoption. They could probably find their biological parents very easily if they ever chose to (They are in their teens and have no desire to do so as of yet in spite of their parents urging).   Under Guatemalan law the birth mother must remain in contact through the entire adoption process, signing off multiple times, including at the end of the process.    I read of one couple who suffered the heartbreak of a delay because the woman who claimed to be the birth mother failed the blood test so the child was not eligible for adoption.  	With this in mind, the place where this book and I part company is in approaching an adopted child when all you have to go on is one sentence in an adoption report.  I strongly agree with the expert who is quoted in the book as saying "Tell your daughter the truth.  Tell her you don't know where she comes from."  as well as the author's friend who says "I think there is not the looking inward in China that you imagine".   Therefore I wince when the author says about an imaginary conversation with the birth mother that "I imagine this partly out of my own projection and wishful thinking, I know.  I want my daughter to have been wanted." Or that "You have to assume that love was involved."  The vast majority of adoption literature that we have received specifically says not to tell your child that the biological parents loved them.  Even the literature that does recommend  telling  the child that the biological parents loved them then goes on to urge you not to tell your child that giving them up for adoption was an act of love, as love then becomes equated with abandonment.  One psychiatrist was quoted as saying that many of his clients are in therapy because of such statements.   This book never explicitly encourages such statements, but I expect that many readers would take it this way.   				------------------Ed 						Tianan  				  
 Dull and dragging.  I found a much more consise version of wiccan history in the beginning of most wiccan books.  The only good thing is the one naked person. 
 First let me start by saying that Manji has very little knowledge of Islam for someone who claims to have gone to an Islamic school.  I will not say madrasa, because the word has been misused, purposely, to give darker skinned peoples an exotic barbarity. The word simply means school and is used, worldwide, to refer to schools both secular and religious, simply coming from the Arabic root "to study."    I do not understand why Manji rants and raves over and over about ijtihad  (reasoning independent of the past religious opinions), but one thing is for sure, and that is that she has no knowledge of Muslim movements of the 18th centuries onwards.  One of the most successful movements, founded by Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, known as Wahhabism by those opposed to it or Salafism by its proponents, has as its founding principle the use of ijtihad, as it wished to break from what it considered was corruption of Islam by all Islamic groups and empires after the community of the Prophet.   However, ibn Abdul Wahhab's followers had to change his theories, as he only accepted the Qur'an and Sunna (the traditions of the prophet), but these traditions were not collected with any authority until the 9th century, meaning in order to claim the Sunna, the Wahhabi's would have to accept the consensus of the first 3 centuries of Islam (which includes the Golden Age).  The problem with the Wahhabi's is that they are a exceptionally right wing, and so their independent analysis (ijtihad) is inherently conservative.  Why doesn't Manji know this.  It is not a hidden fact.  She doesn't even need to learn Arabic to find this out, it is written plainly for anyone with knowledge of English.  You don't need a comprehensive study of Islam to know this, though you would think it should be a prerequisite for anyone claiming to have the ability to tell the world of the trouble with Islam 
 well, what i said above pretty much sums it up. Do not buy these. I got these before the summer of 2006, im going to say around may. They stopped working by november. I didn't even wear them around... I used them with my computer, and my DVD player when my roomate was sleeping. POS, and a waste of money. they look nice, but that is all. do not use you money on these. Skullcandy should be ashamed of themselves for producing such a piece of garbage 
 This book is one of Dean Koontz's worst.  Not as bad as THE TAKING, but right in there.  OK, here is the plot ... really, really bad guy kills girl and parents.  A girlfriend witnesses and escapes only to find herself in the hunt for really, really bad guy.  Girlfriend chases really, really bad guy and craters the guy, but that's not all.  During this (yawn!) high drama, the heroine finds a little girl that really, really bad guy has (yawwwwwn!!) captured.  After knocking off the really, really (yawwwwnnnnnn!!!) bad guy, heroine rescues little girl and adopts her. ZZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!! Oops, sorry, I nodded off.  Please Dean, can you recall this book?  I mean we aren't asking for an apology here -- just take this piece of junk off the market.  I did see where "new and used" has it for as little as 1 cent.  Uhhhhhh!  DON'T SPEND IT !!! It is not worth it !!!!  And Dean, when you are going to give your email address out to the fans?  Most authors do this.....but, you seem to be reluctant.  Could it be literary cowardice?  Inquiring minds want to know.    Much of Dean's work is excellent ..... this book isn't.  Densel Myers Yukon, Oklahom 
 I fall asleep at every single chapter. I think that it's meant for older people AND as a torturing device for high school students! (AHS -I hate summer assignments!) I mean, come on! We're only rising 11th graders! This kind of stuff doesn't interest most of us yet 
 As someone interested in the Russian Revolution, I found this book at a school library and read it. I was not favorably impressed. Lenin is pushed down to the level of megalomaniac idiot. You don't have to like the guy to try to really explain his motivations or to seek real answers to the questions that bamboozle people. In addition to the pyscho-babble mentioned by other reviewers, I had a problem with Robert Service picking on someone who is to dead to sue him for slander. Robert Service accuses Lenin of shooting down his own Soviet troops (an absolute idiocy in the middle of a civil war).It may be fashionable to produce "exposes" of Soviet leaders, but that doesn't make it a good trend. Modern biographers of the Russian revolutionaries need to remember that Joe McCarthy and his Committee are no longer here to black-list them. In Robert Service's biography, I was upset to find the author judging Lenin through 21st century glasses. By this I mean: 1. Cutting out the context of the Russian economy's ruin during the Civil War. 2. The abject failures of the "democrats"  3. Forgetting what the alternatives would have been had the opposition won (I don't mean the Whites- even the peasants hated them) I wonder what Mr. Service would do if he were in Lenin's shoes...  While I'm wondering, I think I'll go pick up W. Bruce Lincoln's books on how the revolution happened and what happened during and after the civil war 
 I was thoroughly disappointed while reading Lord of Silent, as the overall action and suspense was kept almost at a minimum.   It seems almost as if Peters went on a long tangent about the Emerson's family life, writing a lot of filler to go along with the main plot. Until the last forty pages or so, I struggled to get through the book because there was no suspense at all. No cliff-hangers or anything of the sort.  Ramses and Nefret, though darling, only thickened the struggle. I don't think that all the interaction between them was really necessary; perhaps Peters wanted to throw in some romance, but is wasn't working.  Lord of the Silent is a sheer failure of Peters's story-telling skills, as in many of her other books her talent proves to be quite brilliant. Save your money and buy a different Peters's book 
 Unfortunately Mr. Gould is teaching tennis methods on this DVD that have been completely debunked over the past 5 years.  All the top tennis academies now teach the Oscar Wegner method of an open stance, not running with the racquet back, and moving naturally to the ball.  All professional tennis players also use the Wegner method and not the Gould method. I strongly discourage any parent from using this DVD to teach their children the modern game of tennis 
 As another reviewer said in his 1-star review of this book, the sections on poker are excellent but they are buried inside of seemingly endless chapters on Ted Binion's murder, the author's grandparents, and all kinds of other nonsense.  While those subjects could possibly be fascinating, McManus isn't nearly good enough as a writer to make them interesting.  So what we're left with is a highly-compelling description of the 2000 WSOP for about 1/3rd of the book and then 2/3rds garbage.    Best avoided if you're looking for a poker book 
 From the cover hype, I expected a complete turnkey program for installing and learning Linux. I was disappointed.  First, the book-provided CD would not boot, and there were no directions in the book on how to change one's BIOS to allow the CD to boot. (I learned from a friend how to do it.)  Second, the software provided to allow one to have a dual boot (Windows and Linux systems existing separately on one hard drive) is incompatable with Windows 2000 and XP, for it is confused by NTFS files.  So now I've got a useless book, unless I go out and plunk down 50-70 bucks for commercially available partitioning software OR install a companion hard drive reserved solely for Linux.  The cover should warn the inexperienced (dummy) user of these sorts of things 
 Too specific to charity.  Not generalized enough to perform in a "normal" situation.  Was disappointed with the read.  
 I cook healthy all the time and just got this book as a gift...I'm so unimpressed.  I'd seen Ellie's show on the Food Network a couple of times then stopped watching because the stuff she makes is still fattening if you're trying to stay in shape.  Sure it has healthy fats, blah, blah, but that doesn't keep you in shape.  I'd be a bit forgiving if the stuff actually tasted great, but it's mediocre at best.  The book is no different.  And she's not even fun to watch like Rachel or Giada.  I have a pile of healthy cookbooks and diet books this one is definitely my least favorite.  
 If you are forced to watch this movie, imagine that the Pauly Shore masturbation scenes are meant as a clever comment on the movie itself. There is little other hope for preserving your sanity 
 A letdown.  I've enjoyed Calvin Trillin's writing over the years and looked forward to reading his latest book. Unfortunately, Family Man reminded me of one of those multi-page Christmas letters that we receive,  with a cringe, from our better relatives.  This series of anecdotes comes  across as one long euphemism for family life.  The writing is unrevealing  and self-amused, containing the kind of witty, but shallow, stories you  might expect to hear at a light social gathering.  His wife, Alice, comes  across as a dour, controlling presence; his children are anonymous to the  point of being interchangeable.  I have a tremendous respect for Trillin as  a writer, but this book seemed empty, as if Trillin were unable or  unwilling to really share meaningful revelations about his family life 
 ...SI's first album was sheer beginners' luck ? It made me wonder. Whilst I found Dicknity somewhat charming,and mildly entertaining (i'd give it 3 out of 5 stars), their new effort lacks all that I hoped it to be. After many listening sessions, I still don't connect with it and, quite frankly, find myself skipping all the songs a few seconds after they begin 
 I'm not sure about the glowing reviews here, but I fail to see how this book can be much help to current embedded designers? While the copyright is 2004, most of the book reads as if it was written in 1994 or even earlier. The book talks a lot about discrete logic, something that's rarely (or barely) used in modern embedded designs. Likewise, the author largely assumes external memory, which is also increasingly rare.   Most people, today, use SPI, I2C and/or CAN serial interfaces within (and even between) embedded devices and peripherals. The book doesn't provide useful coverage of any of these (or even mention some of them). It's as if the author's last real world embedded development work was with the 8051 a few decades ago? It's the only processor he goes into any detail on and not even the current System on a Chip versions.  The book does contain a useful primer to basic electronics and microcontroller theory. But like the rest of the book, much of it is out of date relatively to current embedded design and the same material is covered much better in other books.   The only reason to POSSIBLY buy this book, in my opinion, is the chapter on worst case timing and loading analysis. But even that section is showing its age. Signal levels, PC board design, bus/signal termination, impedance matching techniques, etc. are largely done differently today than what the author suggests. For example, do you know anyone using TTL discrete logic in their current embedded designs? Apparently both Ken Arnold and Newnes/Elsivier think someone does? You can have my copy back Amazon 
 I have been reading the Navajo mysteries for the first time, in chronological order. I was sad when each ended, and could barely wait to get the next one from the library...until this one. The plot is convoluted and far fetched with a LOT of holes, and I found the setting ugly and depressing, especially the character of the hit man. (This is the second hit man Hillerman's given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama.  Hmmmm...)  I skimmed the last 4 chapters because I was tired of both the book and the setting...I just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because I was not enjoying the experience as I usually do.  So as other reviewers have advised: don't start here 
 Time was when the words Betty Crocker actually stood for something good in cookbooks, although the books' recipes, for better or for worse, were always a product of their times.  The very first "Betty Crocker Picture Cook Book" was published in 1950 (still available), revolutionized how cookbooks were produced, and was an enormous best-seller.  The recipes were the result of much thorough testing in the company's kitchens and in homes across America.  This was cooking from scratch with very little reliance on convenience foods in its pages.  This gradually changed as Betty and her books became more and more of a shill for General Mills' products and her name got plastered on one mix after another to the benefit of the company's bottom line, but to the detriment of good cooking.    The two all-purpose cookbooks that came out in 1961 and 1969 were both loaded with recipes and wonderful tips/helps, although you could see the beginnings of sacrificing quality for convenience--especially in the 1969 edition--but this was still relatively minor in proportion to the majority of the recipes.  If you have one of these books, treasure and keep it; you'll never see their likes again.  The current 10th edition looks good but, like the past several editions, the number of recipes has been drastically reduced.  Gone are the many variations, which are especially missed in baked goods.  It was wonderful having recipes of many cakes that were sized for two people or small families and having different mixing methods to choose from.  Now way too many recipes are of the "dump and stir" method instead of choosing methods that would insure the best results.  Also gone is the very friendly, assuring, conversationial voice of yesteryear.  Yes, there are recipes covering a wider range of ingredients and styles, but they are mostly stripped-down versions.    It's obvious that the folks at Betty Crocker now seem to think that no one really cooks anymore and can't be bothered with proper preparation of dishes, which begs the question of why General Mills even bothers to publish these cookbooks anymore.  The "Better Homes and Gardens New Cookbook" is a better bet for those looking for an all-purpose, everyday guide.  It has a better layout, the recipes and ingredients are generally of a higher quality, and there are more recipes and variations than Betty Crocker's had in some time.  Even better, if you care at all about the quality of the food you eat and serve your family, I highly recommend the cookbooks of Cooks' Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen.  Their comparable, general-purpose cookbook is called "The America's Test Kitchen Family Cookbook."  The recipes are tested and reworked--dozens of times, if necessary--to be the best their staff can make them and you get precise directions in preparing them.  It's a shame that Betty Crocker has abdicated her throne and good name, but there's even better stuff out there now.  Go for it! 
 Save your money - there's really nothing new here 
 After of a long period without seeing my DVD copy, I was alerted by a friend that his copy was oxidized. And so was mine. What to do? In my DVD collection ONLY this one is damaged!!!  I like Kylie and this wonderful collection wich deserves lots of stars + starKyle 
 I would strongly recommend you to get "The Mahabharata" retold by C.Rajagopalachari. This is the best version of the Mahabhatata you can ever read!!! Please do not buy the version by William buck.. 
 I am so tired of people praising Thomas Jefferson as if he were not a racist, hypocritical adulterer.  He was also a rapist!  Sally Hemings was a child and a slave!  She was incapable of giving her consent.  She had no choice but to comply with his wishes even if he allowed her the illusion of thinking she did.  I would recommend this book because of Jefferson's historical significance and to confirm how racist this "founding father" was.  Thomas Jefferson was NOT brilliant or even original.  Do you think he invented democracy?  Please read Lies My Teacher Told Me if you want to know where Jefferson and his peers gleaned their ideas from 
 If you have no idea how to play craps then i will say as all other books it explains the basic bets etc.  The problem this book had, along with many other craps books i have bought is that 70% of the book is basic craps primer, 10% are about stories of big rolls, 10% is about comps and casino management and about 5 pages are about actual strategy to use while playing the game.  Drumroll please, the big strategy that will make you tons of money can be summarized in 3 sentences.  bet the pass line with double odds.  After each Pass win without a loss, press the bet up.  At the end it has you betting something like $500 on the pass and 1000 on the odds bet.  here is the problem:    In order to get to that level the shooter, get this, has to make something liek 11 points.   I have seen some shooters make 5 or 6 points but 11 is very very rare.    This book in a sentence:  After each pass with double odds win press your pass and odds bet.  if you lose on 3 shooters go home. 
 I only paid 60 cents in a used bookstore for this piece of tripe, but figured I used to live in Texas and like political stories, so .....  Then, I found the book so bad, so ridiculous I had to  keep going to make sure it would be on my list of real stinkers.  It is.  Just because you write for films, doesn't make you an author.  The writing was not bad, but I would suggest Mr. Richardson pay someone to give him a decent plot.  Additionally, the stereotype description of Texas and its citizens is quite insulting - very Hollywood.  So it's been sold and will be made into yet another bad movie.  It is really a shame and I did not find it "fun" or "enjoyable" because it was not good satire, it was just plain awful.  You can be sure if this guy keeps writing (I see it did write another which sounds even worse), I won't be reading and anyone who has good taste should avoid his books as well 
 I have read just about every trading, stock scandal, biography type book and this was probably the worst book I've ever read.    As far as Kessler as a writer, he is decent.  The stories were told nicely but the content is what disturbs me.  This was the first book I've read of this type concerning analysts.  I am very familar with analysts and how they work and have done some analyst work myself.  This book justifies to me why analyst are the most worthless people on wall street and how investment banking has ruined the true, real analysts similar to how Kessler described himself in the early years.  Now to the stories.  Lets just say that analyst are no traders and shouldn't even be hanging out with them.  Kessler's "wild" tales sound more like a frat house than a Wall Street war room.  $4000 dinner?  Big deal.  Almost got into a fight?  Whew, that was a close one Andy.  What disturbes me the most is how he never talks numbers.  So and so did this deal and so and so got paid for this.  How much?  Why should I be excited that you donated 6 months of your life and earned 200K airline miles if you're not going to tell me how much you and/or your associates earned?  Most of the deals he participates in he doesn't see a dime from.  What the hell?  So you devote your time and life to kiss butt in anticipation of getting a bone.  The only good thing he did is get out and go to the buy-side of the business.  Kessler spends countless chapters relating stories of traders and other Wall Street bankers that were busted and thrown in jail for this and that, but he tells them in passing as if he read them in the Wall Street Journal instead of getting the inside scoop.    Perhaps the worst story of Kessler's is his supposed encounter with the infamous Nick Leeson of Barings Bank in a Hong Kong bar.  He claims he will never know if it was Nick but it couldn've been.  Great.  So he could've encountered an infamous trader who did way more wild stuff than him but he is not sure it was the right guy.  Let me help you out.  It was not Nick Leeson.  First of all Nick Leeson never traded bonds as you claim the man was a bond trader.  Secondly, the encounter took place in 1990 and even if he had been trading bonds, Leeson was not trading in Asia until the early to mid 90s.  Great story by the way.  Basically this book illegitimizes the analyst business and proves to me how boring and worthless those people are.  I would advise to read this book only if you are interested in falling asleep.  
 Sorry guys, I don't know if I wasn't tasting REAL Miso Soup at my local restaurant, but the thing is I didn't like this one bit, and I still have lots of packages left! haha.. I gave it a chance because I love the soup from the Japanese restaurant I visited and I wanted to taste this soup whenever I wanted, at home. But, I didn't like the flavor, don't know if I'm missing something, but better buy one (ONE) a see for yourself 
 If Mr. Alterman just watched a nightly news cast of CNN, which are full of liberals and how they blast any and everything that does not agree with their limited perception of reality, then he would know that this is standard for all news on cable and web, tear apart the truth and just form a limited perception of reality. Uneducated viewers eat this liberal trash up like McDonalds fast food, however those who know better, avoid it because it can be damaging to one's mental health, but then again Mr. Alterman just wrote this book for the money, even if he makes a fool of himself doing it 
 I loved Fly Girl, so when I seen that a new book came out called For The Love of Money based on the same characters only grown up I was thrilled to read it. But once I did, I could not get past several pages, I honestly don't like it. I own the book and never even read it through 
 Save your money.  Or, if you need to spend it, buy plain yogurt -- you will find the bland white stuff much more exciting than this novel. If you do buy this book, you will wade through pages and pages waiting for the story to get started and then you will not care about a single character you meet.  In the course of the book, there are love affairs, savage beatings, and a kidnapping or two, and all these incidents unfold without an ounce of passion, desire, or emotion.  Anna, the long suffering wife, is so strangled that she can't bring herself to demand a new washing machine.  She and her obtuse husband never talk to each other or to their children.  And we are supposed to care about the marriage of these two?  Buy yogurt 
 I was very pleased to finally acquire this book, having heard of it several years ago. Although I'm not an expert in history, I have read a lot of books concerning this period, and always look forward to reading more. My pleasure soon turned to dismay as I started reading. Through the first few chapters I had a growing but unspecific feeling of unease - something about the prose didn't ring true. It was nothing I could put my finger on; aspects of the writing didn't feel authentic.  I persevered. Eventually I stumbled across details that I knew were wrong. For instance, in this period the term "Your Majesty" to address the King or Queen had not yet been introduced. This didn't come about until the time of the Tudors. Plantagenet monarchs were content to be addressed as "Your Grace". Next, Edward IV was several times described as wearing a collar of interlinked S's. Unlikely. Yorkist collars tended to consist of roses and suns - the interlinked S collars were favoured by the Lancastrian nobility. Then in book 2 of the series we were asked to believe there was a Jewish money-lender in Whitby. As this story is set slap bang in the middle of the three hundred and fifty year period during which all Jews were banned from England, I find this hard to believe. Book 3 (which I've read, living as I do outside the US) would have us believe a crescent moon sailed the sky for an entire night. I ask "On which planet?!" A crescent moon when new is seen only at the start of the night, and when waning is only seen in the hours before dawn. The only moon that is seen all night is a full moon.  These known inaccuracies ruined the book for me. I found myself questioning every detail I read. Was it true? Was it authentic? Or was it just a flight of fancy or wishful thinking on behalf of the author? In the end I was unable to finish the 3rd book in the series because I found myself irritated to the point that I no longer cared about the fates of the characters. I'm only grateful that I got the books out of the library rather than spending hard earned cash on them.   I'm left wondering how such glaring errors could make their way into a published book...or am I expecting too much that a work of historical fiction should reflect its setting accurately 
 The reason many of us fail to succeed is that we buy into common sense.  This book does just that by reinforcing bad practices.  It suggests that one should save and invest wisely.  There is little way in which a person could achieve significant wealth by this method though perhaps a good retirement.  The most successful people do not follow this method.  I am pretty well off myself and I can say I did not follow this method and had I, I would not be doing so well.  Unfortunately there is not a solid path to wealth (not that I know of).  Compare the wealth of Richard Branson versus Donald Trump - two very different approaches without few similarities.  My mother followed this approach and ended with just a small savings.  The story sounds appealing until you realize that it is fiction - there was no such man and that should speak for itself.  
 It is incredible how pop-rock has invaded some illuminated minds and made such cool and nonsense sound flow from so privilleged musicians.  You'll find a technically great keyboardist here playing sequences and sequences of unimportant sounds with master command of his instrument.  This is not the right thing to expect from composer and musician Herbie Hancock 
 About 6 years ago I saw a 20/20 feature about this generation's greatest author Thomas Pynchon, and how incredibly acclaimed and mysterious he is.  So I figured I would check out his work.  I had begun reading fairly intensely and wanted to see what all the buzz was about.  I picked Vineland because it looked intriguing, and hey, anything that features lesbian ninjas can't be bad right??  Well, unfortunately the 20/20 segment was far more intriguing than this book.  I honestly don't understand what all the buzz is about.  Maybe it's because I didn't live through the 60's, or didn't grow up in Humbolt county.  But I certainly don't "get" Pynchon at all.  The man has an incredible imagination, but the problem is that the stories he concocts lack almost everything that I treasure in literature.  The characters are quirky, but I don't care about them.  The circumstances are ridiculous, but rarely to the point beyond a half-amused chuckle.  The "plot" wanders all over the place but ultimately leads nowhere.  If there's a point or theme that the author is trying to convey, it's hidden far beneath the depth which I would care to dig.  Looking back, I can't remember the characters, or the resolution.  I just remember it being a very disjointed story.  It's sad to me that someone with Pynchon's obvious mental and literary prowess, can't use them to write something that is moving, or teaches you something.  Something that sticks with you for life.  My recomendation to people who are considering reading Pynchon: if you like Tom Robbins, go ahead and try Pynchon.  For those who want something a bit more substantive, read John Irving.    Note: It IS possible for some of us to enjoy Stephen King, as well as, the acclaimed "literary" scribes like Saramago, McEwen, Umberto Eco etc.  It just takes a little less pretension, and an open mind.    ...and for the record, the lesbian ninjas were a big disapointment.        
 As a software "old hand" in embedded systems for way too many years, I ought to know better than to be taken in by the hype on this book. But, I blew it. This was a waste of money. The examples are misleading, the  text is just plain wrong in far too many places, and the direction he takes  in instructing is insulting. Then to cap it off, the compiler he wrote the  examples for is very old. I have used Borland compilers since Turbo-Pascal  days, and I used BC3.1 for years (still have it on one of my systems), but  I would not recommend them today as they have been passed by. He obviously  has had experience in embedded user interfaces, but this book will not help  novices learn the how, where, or why of the subject in a way that they can  use for the future. My recommendation is to pass on this one.. 
 This is definitely NOT one of my favorite books about stocks.  The title of the book is a little deceiving, the author talks a lot about option instead of stocks and half the book is about stock splits.  Chapters 1-4 are about general info, such as you must buy and sell to make money, don't hold for a long time. You must research the stock before purchase, EPS must increase every year.  I didn't find anything in those chapters that I didn't already know.   Chapters 5-10 is all about stock splits and when to purchase the stock as well as when to sell. Once again, the author talks about the obvious; buy when you hear that stock is splitting and sell after the split before the after split dip.    Chapter 11 gets into more advanced trading techniques, the bull put spread.  This is not something that I use or will use in my trading.   Chapter 12 is the concluding chapter  
 Maybe because i'm not in my forties or fifties and have never experienced marriage or having kids......is the reason i didn't like this book.  I didn't think it was a bad storyline but I felt the way everything came together it was too unrealistic.  I really couldn't get into the characters either--her husband seemed boring and cold.  I wouldn't read this book again and I wouldn't recommend it to people 30 and under b/c they wouldn't understand the issues here. 
 More an attempt to cash in on Rice's genre with far less enjoyment than that which was provided by the graphic novels and movies. Unless you like reading the encyclopedia or the dictionary, there's really no reason to purchase this book. Fans of Ms. Rice already know these facts 
 I recommend you not buy this book or cd.  I listened to the CD and it was too elementary 
 For years with a combination of paranoia and political zealotry, conservatives have promoted the myth that the media was bias against them.  Most conservative believe this claim even through there is no real evidence to support it.  Brian Anderson's book, South Park Conservatives, is the latest book that tackles the subject of left wing bias that adds to the countless number of conservative books that have made the same claim.  In the book Anderson, main objective is to promote the rise of conservative news reporting, and to claim their reporting of the news is a lot more honest and factual, which simple research would show that those beliefs were never true.  One recent example to show that is not true is Ben Domenech who ran his own blog before he was hired by the Washington post as a blogger.  Domenech resigned, recently, when it was revealed he plagiarized from several articles he wrote for several publications including conservative ones.  Domenech confessed to that he plagiarized works of others.  This is one of the examples of dishonest journalism that conservatives have been involved in that Anderson does not talk about in his book.   Anderson's own methods of judging liberal bias is questionable and ridiculous.    Here are some examples of how he judges if you are liberal, and how he measures liberal news bias.   Anderson claims being a liberal means supporting abortion, racial preferences, a lack religious belief, having blame or hate America attitude, have no objections to Adultery and do your own thing 60's values.  Anderson never says how 60's values are bad, or what 60's values are supposed to be.  The simplistic and silly comparisons Anderson came up with in the second chapter of his book have little to do with real liberal beliefs, but how conservative prefer to see Liberals and Democrats.   This is to show a lack of respect and contempt of their political views with petty attacks and false claims.  In addition, Anderson mentions nothing about other Conservative biased views, of past and present, such as Rush Limbaugh racist comment to a black caller, during his early days on the air.  Shaun Hanity early radio days of Gay and Lesbian bashing, Ann Coulter and Michelle Malkin columns being dropped because of their extreme biased and liberal bashing and finally Bill o'riley who threatened that San Francisco should be blown up by terrorist because they voted against Army recruiting.  Yet, these are the conservatives praised for being the one defending against Liberal bias with honest reporting.  Nevertheless, an [angry] rant that a city should be attacked by terrorist, expressing a hate for liberal views, racism and gay bashing has nothing to do with honest reporting or defending against the false claim of liberal bias.  In the book, Anderson praises the Conservative media for being the ones who got the late President Regan biography pulled from CBS because of objections from conservative on how the former president was portrayed.  Later in the book, he objected to [The Conservative] Sinclair broadcasting not showing an anti Senator Kerry film, Stolen honor, connected to his Vietnam service, a month before the 2004 November elections.  In the book, he claims that Democrats that controlled public pension funds threatened shareholder lawsuits if the film was shown.  However, that was never true.  The letter came from Glickenhaus & Co., a Wall Street investment firm holding 6,100 shares of Sinclair stock, their political affiliation was never mentioned in the letter.  And, even if Democrats were responsible it would not have mattered because Anderson had no objections to Conservative-Republicans, that included him, protesting against the Regan Bio.   So why should Democrats, he claim objected, not have the same right to do the same over the portrayal of Senator Kerry?  Anderson main objection over the Regan bio was its inaccuracy, which is the same reason for the objection of the bio on Senator Kerry, which he was upset that only 15 minutes of the two-hour bio attacking the senator was shown.  The predictability of South park conservatives was to praise the conservative media while ignoring it moments of being dishonest, while attacking Liberal-Democrat views with the same bias Anderson claims he is against.  It was also predictable in ignoring Conservative bias, which makes Anderson another conservative who is a hypocrite about fighting media bias, because they ignore the same bias in their own ranks.

 This book is nicely illustrated, but you will be frustrated if you try to prepare for your examination based on this book. reaction mechanisms are not there, the details are scarce, and important points are too often omitted. only suitable for those who will only do one biochemistry course 
 ...is still phonics...while calling it "phono-graphix" may be little more than a sales ploy, the authors indeed seem not to understand the phonics method as it's currently practiced...they seem to confuse phonics with the language that appears in many so-called "basal" readers -- e.g. "See Spot run. See Bob run. See Spot and Bob run."...such "basal" readers have very little relation to true phonics instruction...regardless, what the book presents is in fact basically just old-fashioned phonics...phonics probably is best for getting down the basics necessary for starting reading...but there are other phonics options -- my own favorite is "Explode the Code"..."Reading Reflex" is adequate but there's nothing special about "phono-graphix"...shop around -- there's better stuff available 
 This book depends upon (count'em) five works from the nineteenth century, all of which have been debunked by scholars. It is a wonderful fantasy. If you like reading fantasy, and can accept it as such, it will be a great book for one to read.   However, ask yourself what has happened to Hal Lindsey in the last 36 years: he made a fortune, now owns several homes and luxury cars. Strange way, don't you think, for one to show his belief that the end is near 
 This product does not work.  The vendor is great though.   They refunded our money very quickly.   We were very disappointed because it is a great idea.  
 I wanted a book like this for myself and to educate my kids. The reviews were glowing, but I found the illustrations to be weak.  They are plentiful, but they don't appeal to me.  The cover art is the pinacle of the quality.  I feel a bit silly, because I usually do quite a bit of research.  I guess this was an IIB--Internet impulse buy.   Oh well, I am keeping the book because the text is informative.  
 I loved "Diary of a Witch" and was hoping that this book would be just as good and give even more insight.  This book can not compare. It takes away Sybil's validity. She is really quite vain and arrogant,very  self absorbed,and homophobic.  It was a dissapointement and even made my  view of "Diary of a Witch" come down a notch. Much too wordy and  runs around in circles 
 Meandering, amateurish writing with no conflict.  Please save yourself the time of reading this unsatisfying book.  I kept hoping that all the ideas that were introduced would be developed and paid off, but they never were.  as I got later and later in the book, I thought perhaps there was a big surprise ending, but it never arrives!  Lots of interesting storylines are started - is there intelligent life on the new planet?  Will the starship stay and come into conflict with the native population?  Will the legions of sleeping crew awaken?  Will any of the crew abandon their mission, or natives stow away on the ship?  Will either betrayed lover freak and do something?  Will the VOLCANO go off for christ's sake???  Nothing happens!!! The book stomps all over Chekhov's cardinal rule of drama - if you put a shotgun on the wall in the first act, it damn well better go off in the third.  There are shotguns everywhere in this book but they remain dusty relics that add nothing but frustration to the experience of the reader.  The love story is laughably dry, even though it should be a tension-filled shifting love triangle.  You don't read about any of it happening as it develops.  You just get boring, lifeless updates after the fact.  I didn't care about any of the characters - none of them have any goals, they aren't developed beyond the most rudimentary descriptors, and you don't see them make any compelling choices, again we're just told about their actions after the fact in the most boring, lifeless terms.  The discussions of religion are amusing in moments, but on the whole pretty uncontroversial.  Although the way it's written, you can tell Clarke THINKS he's blowing your mind.  Maybe for some people it's earth-shattering (ha-ha), but again, even if they're good ideas, there's no reason to care about the ideas, because there's nothing at stake, i.e. no story.  seriously, there's no story.  for a moment mutiny is threatened, but it goes away after a polite meeting and one slightly interesting but totally perfunctory interrogation.  i mean it, that's IT.  the love triangle goes nowhere.  one character dies in a tidal wave and even THAT is completely undramatic, and he's brought back to life in a completely routine way on the next page.  yawn!  seriously.  don't read it.  instead, if you haven't already, check out Childhood's End, another Clarke novel, which is completely brilliant.  It has good ideas AND a story, complete with conflict, tension and characters you actually care about.  it's still very cerebral, but in a way that works, unlike Songs of Distant Earth.  Even the title never pays off in the way you want it to.  The starship brings with it all the artwork, literature and music of obliterated earth, and there's concern over how this influx of information will impact the young civilization.  but then you never see any impact.  there's one very mundane concert at the very end with no aftermath, good or bad! although the setup is there for some fascinating conflicts it just never pays off.  kind of like the rest of the book. very disappointing 
 I bought this book to give me a nice overview of Buddhism. I was encouraged by the introduction. Unfortunitly after that the author began to make fun of every other religion. I know that buddhism isn't about that. And i think by putting people on the defense about their childhood religon will make it very difficult for them to remain openminded to the spiritually enlightening concepts that buddhism has to offer. 
 Description or product is wrong.  There is no quad independent power/charging indicators.  They are set up in banks of two.  One light for two charging bays. Batteries must be charged in banks of two.  Tried e-mailing Vidpro for additional info on this charger. E-mail came back as undeliverable.  Cannot find any reviews on the internet for this charger 
 i dont think this book was very interesting The apprentice is a book about: Arduino age 13 his 3 brothers and father are all tailors and his father wants him to be a tailor, but he wants to be a painter, his wish comes true when his father apprenticed him to Cosmo di Forli, a professional painter in renaissance Florence , but one night Arduino realizes that Cosmo is keeping a secret from him in the attic will he stay and keep his job and no say  anything , or will he confront Cosimo if it risks him of loosing his dream?  resting this book was abou 
 This is a Wicca 101 book in disguise.  I have an interest in dream recall, alternate conscious states and lucid dreaming.  This is not what I expected.  This author teaches how to set up an altar, cast a circle and spellcast under the guise of 'dream magic'.  Nice marketing ploy 
 I look for Linda Howards books as soon as they come out but was dissapointed with this one.  An unbelievable plot can be entertaining but this story was to much.    
 The author and most of the readers are missing the boat.  "Jesus Christ" was never a real person.  He is a mythological character, invented in the 2nd Century by members of secret societies and mystery schools that stretched from Egypt to China, practicing a mythological-religious tradition that had existed for thousands of years.  This is what accounts for the widespread myth of Jesus in the ancient world, plus remarkable similarities between the life and teachings of Jesus, Buddha, and many other Pagan gods.  If you want the TRUTH, read "The Christ Conspiracy" and "Suns of God", by Acharya S.  Ignore any book that takes a life history of "Jesus Christ" as reality.  He did not live in India.  He did not live in the Middle East.  He lives only in MYTHOLOGY 
 Grisham's worst book by far.  90% of the story is preaching to the reader that homeless people just have bad luck and are good guys.  It would be ok if that was woven into a good story, but it is not.   For great Grisham read The Firm and The Partner.  For very good, read Runaway Jury and Pelican Brief.  All of these are page turners.  Street Lawyer is a stomache turner.  Really bad.  What happened 
 This woman's book is an embarassment and she is a self deluded human torturer.  Anyone who likes this book is an idiot and millions of humans are embarassed by her.  She has not treated humans with the respect they deserve.  She try to tell you how dangerous she is and then she proceeds to intrude on my space and humiliate me really -- treat me with massive insensitivity. I won't be surprises if she comes to grief.  I hope your carry your book in you pocket, and stingray stabs you right through your book, into your heart.  Overall I found the book poorly written, half baked, and non sensical 
 Lets get 1 fact out: IRON MAIDEN DOESNT CARE ANYMORE!!!  How can they be SO brilliant with # of the beast, Piece of Mind & PowerSlave & then put out 5 terrible records in a row starting with X-factor?  This record is soooo boring! I bought it based on Wickerman which I found to be OK, reminiscent of  the old Iron Maiden & then they just ran completely out of material. Track 2 on sounds exactly the same, long boring slow tunes that never end.. going track after track, album after album. Does "Dream of Mirrors" ever end? I cant ever tell.. I just lose my attention due to its such a GD drag. Then they hit me with "Thin Line" which is even less interesting than the most boring professor I had in the most boring class in my entire college career.   You cant listen to the original "Iron Maiden" release & then seriously listen to this new crap & release it, unless you just dont care. Obviously they dont CARE!! This record is TERRIBLE!  If they did care they would relisten to the first 6 or so & rethink thier efforts & either improve the sound or just end Iron Maiden & come out with a new band named "Too old, too tired!" & quit defiling the great name of "IRON MAIDEN" 
 Do not buy this for your xbox.  It sucks.  The unit was functional (well, not defective) and by 'dialing in' to the unit it was able to communicate (with and w/o wires) with my computer.  The first red flag was when the xbox did not recognize the DWL-G820 as a wireless adapter.  This is normal.  It has to be configured with an IP address, which is ridiculous because the wired router connection is normally plug and play.  However, no amount of configuration in the xbox dashboard would allow the xbox to connect wirelessly.  This was even with the assistance of tech support, which is spotty at best.  The folks are nice enough, but getting through can take a very long time.  I'm okay with networks - all of my other stuff works great - but definitely not an expert, and I could go on and on about the changes I made.  I won't, though.  If you prefer painless set-up it's probably best to match brands when designing a wireless network.  I'll give D-link the benefit of the doubt and admit I was using a router of a different brand, but with all of the configuration options on both ends, this should not matter.  Oh, and I read some of the earlier reviews and I agree that this thing runs real hot.  Who knows what that'll do for the product's longevity because I don't plan to keep it.  If I ever got it to function properly and I had small children, then I'd probably mount it out of their reach 
 This item was not at all what is seems to be.  The box was the only durable part of the toy.  I unfortuantely purchased 3 of these as Christmas gifts for 3 different boys ages 5 & 6 years old.  After seeing them open and what was in the box, I was very disappointed 
 and mostly stupid dialogue!    people do not then or now  deal that way with people,  nor do they not have any idea why people might take kids out of school, at that time after ww2.   example "why must I not marry..." "how could a girl..."  
 After buying this book, you then discover that there is a WHOLE other series of books they want you to buy afterwards.  This book barely covers the areas I thought it would.  Almost the entire book preaches on where to learn, and where to buy, and board a horse.  But doesnt barely, or not even, covers the step by step essentials of how to groom, apply tack, or even how to ride a horse.  They want you to buy the other books to learn that information.  Save your money 
 The techniques that comprise the bulk of this book are aimed at children just beginning to read. For older non-readers, the only answer seems to be to contact the author and pay for her tutoring program.  I have sent e-mails to the address and have not received a reply.  
 Christopher Byron's sensibility indicates that he is a small-minded, pathologically envious little weasle of a man, who tries to puff up his empty meaningless life by attempting to denigrate a great woman who has brought great beauty and grace to our culture.  Unless you're one of those nasty-spirited people who find glee in joining the pack of hyenas who hate powerful, brilliant, talented women because the light from great women's souls is too bright and reveals too vividly your pathetic life, avoid this book. Byron is simply a mean little vampire, trying to suck money and notoriety from the life blood of Martha.  Shame on John Wiley & Sons for publishing this book 
 I cannot recommend this book versus others in the genre at similar prices. The writing is mediocre and while I appreciate the efforts on the charting the data sets are too small to be significant.  Nothing new let alone ground breaking or revolutionary 
 One plot that happened in the book was when the Time Traveller showed his friends the Time Machine model.  His freinds did not believe him.  I didn't like this part because they thought that he was just kidding, and they thought that he was crazy.  Another thing that happened was when the Morlocks tricked the Time Traveller into the Sphinx, and he had to fight them off.  I liked this part because it was exciting, and you didn't know if he was going to escape or not.   The different settings in the book were in the Time Traveller's laboratory in 1900.  In the Eloi world in the year 802,701.  The last setting was on he beach with the huge crabs even further into the future.   The main problem was that the Morlocks had stollen the Time Machine and he was afraid that he was going to be stuck there forever.  This problem was solved because the Morlocks tricked the Time Traveller into going into the shpinx to retrieve his Time Machine.  The Morlocks were waiting inside for him, and as soon as he came in, they attacked.  The Time Traveller struggled to get away and finally he pushed the lever forward and went farther into the future.    All in all this book was pretty boring and slow.  There was only about one exciting part.  It wasn't a very good book.  Book review By: C.D.     
 Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste.  The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste.  It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell.  But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with.  Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader 
 I have had this unit for just over a year.  Beware that the cd tray is in front and it slides in and out.  Because of this design, it is prone to misalign the cd, which will either not load and the "no disc" warning will show or when it does play, there is a significant vibration.  To try to remedy this I had to wedge a piece of folder paper inbetween the disc drawer and the unit!  Alas, I just got tired of not being able to play a disc for my daughter at bedtime.  It is now time to spend a bit more and get a better product such as a Sony..... By the way, the buttons are cheap and the overall construction is poor 
 I bought the book in the airport and started reading it during the 8 hours flight. I could not believe that such an uninteresting and painfully slow paced novel was a bestseller...I forced myself through the first 30 pages...but that was it. I just left it in the airplane.Maybe later got more interesting,I woudn't know that. But what I read was just plain awafull. Now that I look at the amazon's reviews...they are not so bad......makes me very cautious about reviews in the futur 
 This album is terrible.  As a Mississippian, I know David Banner did a poor job of displaying the quality of music in Mississippi.  Besides the singles that were released, this cd has absolutely nothing to offer.  I commend him for trying to put Mississippi on his back, but if he's going to represent on meaningless (how many different times can you refer to your genitalia on one cd?) and useless (even though it's a southern cd, the beats aren't even that good) albums like this, I'd rather he left "The Sip" out of it 
 This book is not for Charmed fans.  It knocks all the little things wrong on set that you may not have noticed and would rather not.  You would think a book of this title would be more positive but this book points out things that went wrong on set such as missing items (jackets, purses, etc.)and it talks about how "real witches" aren't like the ones on Charmed.  Hello, can you say fiction?  So if you are looking for something that knocks the show you will love the book but if you are a true Charmed fan, you will find it offensive.  
 The problem with this book is that it was written as a textbook with very little practal advice and no real "know-how" methods.  Similar to virtually all business books written by professors for colleges, this book falls very short in equipping would-be entrepreneurs with the insight, skills, and know-how needed to become successful entrepreneurs.  I would not waste your money on this book at any price.    If you want a great book on the topic, I highly recommend "The Startup Company Bible for Entrepreneurs".   This little-known book is rapidly becoming THE STANDARD for entrepreneurs.  
 Good organization and readability does not excuse publishers from using their business knowlege to stick it to students.  The "description" here doesn't do anything to change that impression.  Perhaps this book should have been called "How to Make a Killing in Academic Book Sales"  Obviously book buying is a new hazing rite for American students. "Yes, sir, may I have another! 
 I can utterly guarantee that this thing won't work. I was employed in the pest control industry for 16 years. We used to find cockroaches living in such devices all the time (it's usually nice toasty warm in there). Sanitation, exclusion, and very careful application of pesticides is what you need.  Rodents are sometimes repelled for a brief time, but quickly adapt (adapting to environmental conditions is one of the things rats do best). Again, count on sanitation, exclusion, and traps; try to avoid baits because you'd rather know where the little s.o.b. died (i.e. in a trap, rather than in a wall somewhere) 
 Don't get me wrong, I'm all for music that is a departure from mainstream junk. Crispy Ambulance employs basic chords and driving beats that have the potential for being good songs but they just dont have the ability to pull it off. The most obvious downside is the horrible vocals. Let's be serious folks, if you're out of key 90% of the time, your music is going to sound like crap. This is one garage band that should have stayed in the garage 
 Nothing special, nothing new.  Her Nut book, however, is excellent, and you should definitely check that book out.  
 Most Hollywood products are designed to indoctrinate the audience in one way or another. The main propaganda punch line for this move is this: People who work for government agencies are intelligent, kind, ethical, emotionally mature, trustworthy and have your best interests at heart. The US is a beacon of light, goodness, equality and justice. 
 This book is confusing and should be improved (a lot) if there is ever a second edition. First, the book starts by discussing the mobile game market and ends by comparing J2ME to Brew. Both chapters are a waste of time (and money, as you pay for them anyway). Next it starts to dissect MIDP2.0 and the game API. Whereas in some sections the book hits the spot, it has some serious flaws. For instance, it starts teaching animation using basic MIDP1.0 techniques, whereas MIPD2.0 have easier and more effective ways to do the same through the Game API. Once you learn the GameCanvas and Sprite classes you will ask why he did that to you in a MIDP2.0 book.  One mixed bag is the chapter discussing the TiledLayer. The author does a great job, and indicates a great free map editor (Mappy, a great tool to design tilemaps and 2D game levels). However, it ruins this chapter by indicating that you need to subtract 1 from each tile in the map so it will be offseted to the correct value. Later he contradicts himself when showing how to load a .MAP file as a resource, where he says you don't need to subtract anything (which is correct, as a TiledLayer image consider the first tile in the image as 1).   The example game is poor, he could have used the two wasted chapters to develop a more complex example, or a second example. The book has some good info on it, but beware, it has many downsides that even at 27.95 it is quite expensive 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 American Pie: an immature, mindless, vapid, boring, blandly disgusting, humor lacking piece of over-rated trash packed full of cliches, highschool sterotypes, annoying horny teenaged behavior performed by a wonderful cast of grade A douchebags. 
 Why were the other three released on DVD and not this one?  I would like to complete my set 
 For a diehard Austen fan, any sequel or attempt is of interest. I found this book to have a much darker tone than all of Austen's work. Aiken takes the story on a path of brooding, sickness and poverty. The characters are drawn with a much heavier hand and seem to be generally bitter and unhappy in a very 20th century way. Worth reading, but if you read Austen to visit a happier, simpler era, this is not the way to go 
 I have read this book (and its companion volume) a couple of times, and to be honest I am not a fan.  Many of Jan Fennell's suggestions are useful, but none are original.   Ms Fennell's method is based on the idea of using the non-violent language of the wolf pack to put your dog in his rightful subordinate place, and therefore gain his understanding and cooperation.  Alpha wolves eat first - so Ms Fennell has the dog owner eat dinner before his dog.  Alpha wolves take the pack out hunting - so we are bid to walk our dogs daily.  Alpha wolves aren't demonstrative - so we are told to ignore our dogs for five minutes each time we arrive home from work.  These suggestions are sensible, but they are hardly revolutionary.  Maintaining dominant status by behaving like an "alpha" wolf is a technique that has been championed by many other authors - the only difference is that Ms Fennell gives this process the cutesy name of "Amichien bonding".  The technique is a good one for restoring a relationship with a dog that has been spoiled or confused in the past by weak or misinformed owners. Its success lies not only in the owner mimicking canine behaviour, but also in the institution of house rules and a predictable daily routine for the dog.    So what is wrong with this book?  The first fatal flaw is the unrealistic simplicity of the method.  Ms Fennell seems to believe that all canine behavioural problems are caused by the dog wishing to be alpha.  It is certainly true that a dog with a misplaced sense of his own importance will probably become a problem dog.  However, dogs can also behave badly for a plethora of other reasons - poor training, learned fear, boredom, health issues, confusion and inherent high prey drive, to name just a few.  Ms Fennell's insistence that all canine problems are dominance problems that can be cured by "Amichien bonding" is unfortunately just not realistic.       For a professional dog trainer, Ms Fennel also displays a rather disturbing lack of knowledge about several dog breeds.  At one point she states that it may be impossible to fully train Bull Terriers "and dogs of this type" due to their inherent "savage natures"!  One gets the impression that she has been unable to train this type of dog herself and holds a grudge about it.  Whatever the reason, I find it somewhat disingenuous of her to ignore the fact that other trainers have managed to train these breeds to very high standards, and blame her own failure to do so on the dogs instead of on her own methods.  In short?  If you know very little about dog behaviour and have a mildly pushy dog, then this book isn't a bad buy.  Certainly, applying the "Amichien bonding" advice won't hurt.  It is the same type of programme as recommended by dog behaviourists the world over (you can get much of the same information for free on the internet, from Shirley Chong's website for example).    However, Ms Fennell's book is not a comprehensive guide to solving every dog's problems.  If your dog has moderate to serious behavioural problems, save your money and book a consultation with a professional behaviourist.  Your dog will thank you for it.   
 The very first chapter talks about folks starting to invest in real estate.  Of course they bought all their investment properties  using other peoples money (mortgages), which is fine. The only question for Mr. Kiyosaki: Which bank is giving a conventional mortgage for the investment property at 95 % LTV, meaning putting only 5% down? As far as I know 5% downpayment  or less is available for PRIMARY residence ONLY. You can not have 2 primary residencies. The Bank can see in your credit report how many mortgages you have. When applying for the new mortgage bank requires to explain all other mortgages in the credit report. You definetely can not buy all 5 properties -  with 5 % down. It is very inaccurate and misleading. Minimum downpayment for the investment property is 20%, not every bank will do it, a lot of them will ask for 25-30% downpayment for investment properties. Go to your local bank and check it out. So Mr. Kiyosaki is not telling the truth? Are those stories REAL? Seems like he is getting rich on writing very controversial books using the success of the first couple of them but not really investing in real estate. 
 Don't ever buy this. It is a rip off and a gimmick. Your hands will get tired really fast for shaking the flashlight and 30 seconds of shaking will not even get you 5 minutes of light with consistent brightness. Even more the light dims almost instantly after shaking with no retention of charge whatsoever. Other flashlights that require cranking can give up to 2 hours of light for 1 minute of cranking if you get the right one 
 The "hermeneutics" of thinkers like McClosky, Rorty, and even some of those 'austrian' economists over at GMU is certainly not a new creed. It is the age-old song of the German historicist school and epistemological relativism. Okay, so it has a new coat of paint, updated with a few contemporary insights. McClosky targets economics with hermeneutic "propositions", seeking to unravel the modern methodological basis for the science (positivism/empiricism) and propose a new criterion to judging economic propositions (or any proposition whatsoever).  To McClosky, truth and falsehood are irrelevant categories -- what matters is only whether or not something is persuasive. Thus, rhetoric claims prime importance. Consider this telling excerpt from the book: "The very idea of Truth--with a capital T, something beyond what is merely persuasive to all concerned--is a fifth wheel. . . . If we decided that the qualitity theory of money or the marginal productivity theory of distribution is persuasive, interesting, useful, reasonable, appealing, acceptable, we do not need to know that it is True (p. 47)." Or, in comparing economic science to literary criticism, McClosky writes: "[Rhetoric] believes that science advances by healthy conversation, not adherenence to a methodology. . . . Life is not so easy that an economist can be made better at what he does merely by reading a book (p. 174)."  Surely, to anyone except those with a Ph.D. in philosophy, this must strike one as totally counterintuitive and absurd. Are we really ready to concede that there is no objective truth? All right -- let us do so, for the sake of argument.  But then we must of course inquire into the status of McClosky's own propositions. It is simply contradictory to make validity-claiming proposition averring that validity-claiming propositions cannot exist. Furthermore, such a claim implies a performative contradiction, as any argument presupposes the proponent's understanding of the meaning of truth and falsehood simply in order to say "I propose such and such, and you can either agree or prove me wrong." A proposition gains axiomatic status if it must be presupposed in the course of refutation. Argumentation has such axiomatic status. It is nothing but nonsense to argue that you cannot argue.  In fact, McClosky and other hermeneuticians are _so_ wrong that they can only say what they say _because_ it is wrong. For to them, there is no objective truth criterion for any proposition whatsoever. And yet, the use of language itself is a form of action, and surely there is a difference between McClosky's pronouncements and, say, the clacking of buttons on the keyboard as he writes it out (well, she was a he when this book was originally written and published, back when i read it -- i really don't know what pronoun to use). The most elementary tools of logic, like junctors and quantors, and the Laws of Identity and Contradiction, have their roots in action. these laws could never be undone by anyone, for in order to deny that they are in fact laws of reality, one would have to presuppose their validity. Accounting for the structure of elementary logical propositions (like "Hamburgers are a food") is the fact that in each and every action, a person must identify a situation and categorize it one way or another if choice is to be possible. Thus, while one could certainly say "and" means something other than "and", one could not deny its realist praxeological-ontological meaning, rooted in reality and action, without stumbling headlong into contradiction. Thus, at the _very least_, the existence of language presupposes the existence of truth categories and this could never be denied by anyone using language. Evidently, then, some common ground exists for people. McClosky's entire position is full of hot air.   Of course, McClosky levels many challenges to scientific orthodoxy of empiricism in the social sciences. All well and good -- empiricism is an empty doctrine, completely inadequate as a methodological basis for economics. But McClosky has simply chosen the wrong target. Empiricism claims that all a priori knowledge is merely analytic (in fact, it is doubted if analytical propositions qualify as knowledge at all). All facts of reality must be observable, and all truth-claims must be verifiable (or are least falsifiable) by experience. With this approach, an economist would be left willy-nilly unable to _know_ anything, since they must concede that experience could have yielded a different result. But if McClosky's purpose was to attack the foundations of objective truth in economic science, why choose empiricism? would it not have been more prudent to target the extremist-rationalist thinkers such as Ludwig von Mises or Murray Rothbard? Such proponents of economics as a realistic science of a priori laws whose validity is not contingent on experience, would seem to be the antithesis of the hermeneutics position. The irony of it all is that McClosky's own methodological position is impotent to take down empiricism, much less rationalism which goes essentially unchallenged.  The refutation of hermeneutics vindicates rationalism, leaving us with no choice but to regard hermeneutics at a vacuous doctrine. This is a book of less-than-zero scientific value. If you are looking for good writings on rationalist economic science, see Ludwig von Mises, _Human Action_; idem, _Epistemological Problems of Economics_; Murray Rothbard, _Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market_; Hans-Hermann Hoppe, _Economic Science and the Austrian Method_. This book should not be taken seriously, but laughed and ridiculed as contradictory garbage 
 C. S. Lewis exposed the circular reasoning in Hume in the book "Miracles."  David Hume was not a skeptic.  He was a freemason and therefore a gnostic.  He was only skeptical of nongnostic positions, such as Christianity.  He was an apologist for gnosticism.  He had blind faith allegiance to the masonic lodge and its creed.  His argument against miracles is his chief argument against Christianity, and it suffers from circular reasoning.  Circular reasoning you exclaim?  Yes.  Hume argued that miracles violate uniform experience.  However, if uniform experience is against mircales, then they cannot happen.  Uniform experience is his presupposition.  But, uniform experience is defined to exclude miracles.  If they didn't happen, well, they didn't happen.  This begs the question.  I have a better argument than Lewis's.  I would simply point out that pure logic cannot dispense with the empirical question of whether miracles happen.  Afterall, mathematics is made up of tautologies.  As such, mathematics or logic or any formal reasoning cannot have physical meaning.  Pure logic, as Hume employs, cannot tell us anything about the world.  Therein lies the sophistry.  It boils down to the distinction between analytic statements and synthetic statements.  Whether or not miracles happen depends not on logic, but on the existence of God who intervenes in human affairs.  As the former atheist Antony Flew said, it is impossible to argue against the existence of God in light of the evidence of intelligent design of the universe.  If anyone went to the moon and found a house there that supplied oxygen, food and other human necessities, they wouldn't hesitate to posit a creator of that house.  So why would anyone question the existence of God in light of this wonderful planet that supports our lives?  What is remarkable about him is how irrational he is.  He possesses a flair for writing and shows great promise in reasoning.  Yet, he sacrifices good reasoning for pushing his gnostic agenda.  It's like a person who graduates from medical school who decides to murder patients, or a graduate from law school who chooses to rob banks.  He tries to use reasoning to support irrational thought.  Hume was a strange man.  The engine is running, but there's no one behind the wheel.  
 I admit that I'm addicted - despite the s.l.o.w. progress, constant female bickering, and frequent fashion details.  I want to see how this dang series ends...will it?    This particular installment of the Dragon et. al. left me feeling underwhelmed.  The ending was a disappointment, but I'll press on and order book 8.  
 This book is horribly outdated!  If you have Acrobat 5, - fine. Or maybe not so fine... use the money you would have spent on this book and upgrade to the current Adobe version: Acrobat 7 as of Sept 2006. ..and beware of Wiley Books that don't specifiy the application version - -  Wiley is notorious for this -- remember, when purchasing a Wiley book -- think twice if the version of the application is not specified. 
 Trashy, trashy, trashy novel!  He is an abusive hero with two sides to his personality-since he is half English and half Arabic. Frustratingly, his less redeeming qualities is attributed to his Arabic culture and Muslim religion, which is very insulting for anyone who comes from the Middle East, and his admirable qualities-not surprisingly- stem from his English background. The heroine is just as abusive as the hero, yet hailed and praised by the author because she happens to be "English"-extremely stereo-typical and racist for both characterization.  Does Coulter ever take into account that many romance readers have ethinic backgrounds and that she has to be a responsible writer and must depict some form of veracity-good and bad- when she takes on a project that deals with a culture that is not her own? Many innocent readers may be mislead and misinformed about a culture they do not know about and mistake these types of fictions as a true historical background when in actuality, women tended to possess political, economical and social powerful positions within the harem and were not these submissive, useless women Coulter made them out to be. All I ask of an author is to balance the good and the bad so as not to misinform the public-which Coulter failed in this novel.   I am not normally picky when it comes to historical truths in fictional Romances; in fact, I write many reviews telling oher readers to lighten up when it comes to historical errors the author may have made inadvertantly. However, this is an exceptional case because of the extreme lenghts Coulter went to in insulting and degrading this particular culture without adding any positivty to form some sort of balance in the story-line-very infuriaiting.  My advise is to skip this novel, I could not even finish it and threw it away 
 "All life/ has song..." Stan Rice announces at the start of "Singing Yet," chaotic collection of poems from his prior three releases, plus several new poems. Rice (who sadly passed away at the end of 2002) displayed a flair for evocative imagery, but his poetry is so confusingly random that it's almost impossible to decipher.      The first parts of the book are a tangle of bizarre eroticism (comparing melons to a woman) and odd morbidity ("It is death's/drizzle we write/checks on/when we die/we bounce"). But in the "Some Lamb" section, Rice delved into some deeper, more real turf: the death of his daughter from leukemia. "We stopped beside a hole where she/was put by men who could not see."      With an actual focus, Rice's poetry shifts into aching confusion, describing his daughter's illness, death, and burial, all the emotions that came with it. Unfortunately, Rice's poetry doesn't improve after that, including in the stretch of new material at the end of the book -- while his style mellows out a little, Rice's poems are still surreal and still nonsensical. "The iceplants/turn to the sun/their purple/sadist flowers..."     Dreamlike poetry and strange images are not a problem. But Rice's poetry goes beyond strange and into incomprehensible. "Golden silver copper silk/woe is water shocked by milk/heart attack, assassin cancer/who would think these bones such dancers?" he announced at one point. Okay, whatever. Maybe it's about death. Interpret that as you will. While his poetry can be intriguing and seductive, most of the time it just seems like cool phrases tossed randomly together.      Certainly Rice can't be faulted for his lack of description. He could evoke astoundingly weird, Dali-esque images. The problem is, they seem strung together like beads. Rather than focusing on one and exploring it, he seems just to have tossed them together randomly, assuming that they will see profound despite their lack of connection. "Thunder no more, sky/big sandwich gold & coral" -- it doesn't evoke anything by itself, and it seems completely disconnected from what comes after it.      An overview of Stan Rice's poetry, with a stretch of new material, "Singing Yet" doesn't shed any more light on what went through his head. Nor does it make his random poetry any more appealing. 
 Don't buy this book, unless you are heavily interested in literary theory, linguistics and/or semiotics.  This is not a history book nor a book on history, but rather a linguistic and literary interpretation of some accounts of the conquest of America.  Further, the book is biased.  It does not discuss the truth of the matters asserted in the early conquest accounts and there is barely any criticism and analysis of the reliability of those sources.  Get instead a Prescott if you want to know what the conquest was all about 
 This book is dangerous and full of errors relating from a general ignorance of basic human development.  If you want your life not to change when you have children, DO NOT have children.   Following this third world orphanage model of raising a child is not the answer to sleepless nights and crying babies.  All crying eventually stops, either when the babies needs are met, or when the baby gives up hope.  
 A friend recommended this book to me as a treat in preparation for my vacation to Charleston with my mother.  So I sent her a copy for us to read together.  It was not a treat.  I was disappointed there were not enough descriptions about Charleston and the Low Country.  I've been to lovely Charleston and Beaufort and this book didn't make it recognizable.  I agree that character development was shallow.  What was that mess in Mexico that made no sense?  And, nothing is more aggravating than reading a 'professionally' written book with TYPOS!  And repetitious descriptions.  The ending was implausible and a rush to have some closure.  PLEASE do not compare this author to the talented Pat Conroy.   So we waded through the 'pluff mud' of Islands, and are giving Siddons another chance with Peachtree Road, but my mother has finished it, calling it 'bizarre'.  Gee - can't wait 
 Scarpetta, Marino, Benton, and Lucy are all back with another good guy gets bad guy caper.  The bad guy in this case is mad at Lucy because of something she inadvertantly caused when she was 17 that ruined his life.  So he winds up stalking her and killing others.  What the fabulous four don't know is that the individual crimes they are each investigating all wind up being linked together and committed by the same bad guy.  The story also places much emphasis on their personal lives which all pretty much suck.  They are all alone and miserable in their own ways and don't seem to be able to do much about it.    Sadly, I can't muster up anything nice to say about this book.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the fondness I still have for the early books in the series.  Once upon a time I bought the new releases in this series the day the hardback came out and stayed up all night to read them.  But with this one, there is nothing about it that makes it worth reading.  There are even places where the grammar is just horribly and shockingly incorrect.  Cornwell didn't used to be this sloppy or seem to care so little for a series that she spent such time and effort developing.  I hate to see them go, but after the next one (which unfortunately I already bought) I think I'm done 
 I mostly bought this book because I am a fan of the TV show Medium and thought this book might give me an idea of who / what the real person was.  I was hoping also to hear more about the criminal profiling aspect of Alison Dubois' "gift".  Unfortuantely none of the above were achieved.  This book seems to be more about telling it's audience to accept the psychic's in their lives.  I didn't feel it gave me any insight into the afterlife.  Overall I was very disappointed 
 As a South African acquaintance said to me... "I've never been able to finish a Gordimer book". I decided I would finish this book, and it is well written if in an archingly intellectual manner. But its tough  going...too detached, and ultimately not enough to keep you wanting to go  back. I chose it at random since I had heard so much about Nadine Gordimer,  but had never read any of her work.  Suggest finding another one 
 I wish I would have saved the invoice for this book. I would send it back today!!. Unless you can get a doctor to let you give yourself injections of hCG, this book is a waste of time and money 
 This book has its interesting moments, but seems to be quite bland at times.  If read for school, don't become discouraged too easily.  The true meaning of the book is brought together later by the author. All in all,  the book was rather bland to me, but I'm simply one reader.  Find out for  yourself 
 Having devoured the Skye series, and finding them to be the absolute best of the historical romance genre, I found The Last Heiress to be a huge disappointment. The plot is comparatively simple.The reader waits for the adventure and intrigue of Small's previous novels, but it never comes. I find it hard to believe that this is even the same author.The plot is entirely predictable after chapter one. No surprises twists or turns. Save your money and skip this one 
 The opening strip scene is reminiscent of Barbarella - too bad those aren't Basinger's legs though. Nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by Kim Basinger. I have never understood Ackroyd's characters. And keeping in form, he is once again as unfunny as mud. Basinger tries so hard - too hard - to rescue this film, but that's no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film. OK so she munches on batteries, and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime. She seems a genuine Betty Crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts. Jon Lovitch also tries to prop up Ackroyd and this weak script. However, his contribution seems way overstated to me. He doesn't have much to do. Funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step-mother is not like other people. Basinger's character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do. Think, Jar-Jar Blinks. I suppose it's OK as a backdrop for housecleaning. But that's it. Flat and mechanical 
 The only sentence worth reading in this preposterously conceived and insultingly rendered apparent rip off of Neil Goodwin's THE APACHE DIARIES is the author's apology to the Apache people.  But this acknowledgement that the book should not have been written without a meaningful understanding of the historical and cultural context is insufficient. A wise person once advised me to avoid spending too much time cleaning up others' turds, so I'll refrain from the painful and pointless exercise of cataloging Fergus' many, many misrepresentations of people, place and history, except to note that even a cursory reading of reliable sources on Apache interpersonal conflict makes it clear that Apache scalping was very limited in scale, aberrant in relation to their culture pattern, and recently learned from bounty hunters and others. Suffice it to say that many Apaches believe there is no greater sign of disrespect than speaking when ignorant. The spiritual and material consequences for doing so may be swift and devastating.  By dressing up a puerile fantasy as a glimpse into the forgotten last chapter of the story of the thoughtless subjugation of Native America, Fergus has viciously maligned the Apache. The author might consider taking his apology directly to the living relatives of the people--at Fort Sill, Mescalero, and San Carlos--who he has so thoroughly insulted. 
 GOD..."WAY DOWN YOUNDER ON THE CHATTACHOOCHIE"??? THAT'S THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER HEARD OF. THIS IS THE WORST COUNTRY MUSIC AROUND! IF YOU LIKE COUNTRY MUSIC LISTEN TO THE ALLMAN BROTHERS! YOU SUCK ALAN JACKSON 
 Was looking forward to this book since I found some systems using BBs.  However, was less than impressed.  Nothing new, especially for someone that the indicator is named after.  Lots of references to his websites too.  Squeeze play-expect a move after period of low volatility, yep, nothing new.  But, no good discussion on how to implement strategy to capitilize on squeeze.  You'll learn more from the following tips than this book,  1. If price touches a rising lower Bollinger Bands (long) or a falling upper Bollinger Bands (short) in the traded time frame, that is a safe entry point.  2. If price touches a lateral (flat) Bollinger Bands and is also touching (or nearly touching) a lateral Bollinger Bands in a higher time frame, that is safe entry for trade in opposite direction.  3. If price touches lateral lower Bollinger Bands (for long) and lower Bollinger Bands on higher time frame is distinctly rising, that is a safe long entry (reverse for short).  4. If price touches lower Bollinger Bands and MACD and/or stochastic on higher time frame is showing long, that is safe long entry.  
 While the author rehashes some basic business writing theory, she consistently fails to follow her own rules: - The text is full of fluff - The style is flippant instead of useful - The lecture style puts you to sleep   There are much better books on the subject. A textbook approach is necessary for this subject. Not this dopey-run-on-crap.  
 I read this book because of the good reviews. By the end of the book I wanted to shake Alison and dump her myself. 
 I thought Weston's book was a little too short when I first picked it up. Turns out I should have relied on my instincts.  While I believe Weston does a fair job introducing readers to the concept of arguing, he fails terribly overall. Basically, any student that took Math in high school that involved "proofs" would know Weston's entire book.   The only thing I really enjoyed was the index on "cheating."  Don't get this book if you have ever taken anything involving mathematical proofs or philosophy. Otherwise, knock yourself out 
 I have to whole heartedly agree with review posted by Deanna Weber Prine on April 26, 2006.  In addition to that psoting, here are my personal thoughts.  My biggest complaint wasn't the unlikable hero, but the poor story telling.  During this whole series, it came across to me that Donaldson was more interested in describing the self-pity and self-loathing of Thomas Covenant, than he was in telling a truly good story.  His focus on this leads to unoriginal and unimaginative plot that is completely predictable and cookie cutter.  The only true twist Donaldson put on this story, was that the unwitting and unwilling hero was so despicable.   The only truly good portion of this series is in the second book when Donaldson leaves Covenant for a while and spends some time writing about the other characters and their "adventure".  In closing, if you are looking for an exciting, fresh, and fun fantasy series that will captivate you with solid character development and an original and exciting plot, I wouldn't recommend this series.  Instead look at such series as Carol Berg's Rai-Kirah series or George R.R. Marin's A Song of Fire and Ice series 
 First of all there is no such word in Websters and I do agree with some of the other reviewers.  I did read Blindsighted and found much repeated word for word from that.  The people in charge of solving this do indeed have too too many personal problems and not enough swapping of information.  When the doc hears something, she doesn't know what they are talking about as no information was given her by the detectives.   After all she was at the scene of most the crimes and should have been given a better handle on it.    Then I hate the way the perps get away with stuff right under the noses of the surveilance.  This author sure leaves you dangling.   
 In this writing the author starts out with an opinion that the disciples were not intellectuals.  What is the basis for this statement?  His basic premise is that Jesus refuted and did not choose the intellectuals of his day.  This presupposes that an intellectual had to be a part of the orthodox establishment.  Where in the Bible does it state that the chosen could not read or did not communicate with others on philosophical or religious matters?  They were all common men classified as laborers, fishermen or clerks.  I will not assume that people of these vocations are all ignorant and unsophisticated.  The author essentially is spurning people of mental capability as related to thinking capacity.  The book is essentially the presenting of the author's own belief system using the disciples as his puppets for story building.  I am indeed struggling through this work anyway.  If you want a heavily romanticized story of the 12 chosen ones this fits the bill.  I was looking for something a little more realistic I suppose.  The disciples seem to be a bit cartoonish in this work. There is a lot of moralizing written in these pages.  The work is better suited to sermonizing then getting a feel for history.    Truth is illusive in this one.  I can't help but feel the disciples might even feel offended by some of these characterizations, if not be humored by them 
 Never received the book, so very disappointed at the delivery process and cost I have incurred 
 Boring, boring, and oh, did I mention boring?  It was short, not terribly clever at all, and the illustrations are not even Dr. Suess. I felt ripped off.  I don't know why I thought it was tooth "fairy" related, as our daughter just lost her first tooth and we thought this would tie in.  It doesn't.  Neither of my kids (3 and 6)liked this even a little.  They both said it was...boring.  
 If your organizational culture is one that supports and encourages leaders to spend a lot of time discussing their feelings then this might be a good book for you.  If your leaders enjoy learning through creative techniques such as making crafts, drawing pictures, writing poems, and metaphores, then this is book is just what you've been searching for.  I have never encountered such an organization (not counting my girl scout troop).  Feelings and creativity are important in every business.  This book, in my opinion, goes too far.  Working in the HRD field, I'm accustomed to reading lots of corny ideas for training and most of them can easily be modified to suit the company culture.  I wasn't able to salvage any activity from this book - it was just too "out-there" for me.  I wish someone else had reviewed this so I didn't make the mistake of purchasing it.  
 What a thought provoking and creative album title.I wonder how long it took her to come up with that name?I cant believe the trendy garbage people listen to these days.All the songs sound the same and have the same pointless lyrics to them.She cant produce,rap write or do much of anything of value.I saw this trash at tower records and it was just collecting dust.Save your money and dont buy any of her worthless junk ever again.Listen to some real artists like black sabbath,judas priest or iron maiden.Dont forget to vote for my review 
 "Wise Blood" could more aptly be called "Stupid Minds."  Both titles are tendentious, but the latter is more accurate.  Ms. O'Connor depicts a pair of Southern troglodytes in the grip of religious mania.  We are meant to regard their fanaticism as a form of primal wisdom; in fact, it is merely ludicrous or pathetic.  Those who deem this judgment parochial should ask themselves whether Ms. O'Connor, an Orthodox Roman Catholic, was any less so.   Faulkner plumbed the humanity within or beneath the grotesque.  Ms. O'Connor is more interested in the God-driven grotesqueness that warps humanity; she sees it as higher knowledge.  Her prose in this early effort is merely workmanlike, and time has made what was strange or shocking in her vision seem familiar.  If blood wisdom were truly wisdom, an Islamic terrorist would be wise 
 The use of the words 'she' and 'herself' as well as the mockery of the portrayal of Vice as a 'floozy' really sickened me.  It made me realize I myself and several other people I know could have written a better book on the subject.  Did it feel good to type in 'herself' and 'she' as if to suggest no male will read this book and if they did they were excluded?  Can we just get past this feminist finger pointing?  This is 2006.  There is no doubt the author could have used the pronouns 'his and herself' or something more objective.  It just leaves one to ask....why didn't she 
 The only good thing is that the review system does not let me rate this zero stars.  From the obscure language to the fight the system attitude, this book does nothing except expound upon Profesor McLaren's political views.  This publication points at one facet of the discussion of critical pedagogy and fails to evaluate the other aspects.  As a political work, this book appears well researched, but look elsewhere for a book on critical pedagogy 
 I was attracted to this book because I was turning 50 and finding it unexpectedly disturbing.  The book was interesting enough but not very useful.  I didn't really find out anything I didn't already know - other than there were a lot more women out there who were going through, or had been through, a similar re-evaluation. So while it was vaguely comforting, it wasn't at all inspiring or particuarly helpful.  I wouldn't really recommend it to anyone who hasn't had a traditional married-with-kids-plus-career lifestyle 
 As someone who is very interested in oil and it's effects on the global economy, I looked forward to reading this book with great interest.   The Leebs go through a cursory analysis of the state of the current oil supply.  The question of when we will reach peak oil production is open to great debate with estimates varying widely depending on who is asked.  The Leebs assume that we will arrive at our peak oil consumption in this decade and predict $100/barrel oil by 2010.    They may be right, they may be wrong.  I am not troubled by their prediction of $100 oil; however, their conclusion that $100+ oil will cause hyperinflation is stated as fact with no real evidence to substantiate their belief.  In fact, many economists will argue that rapidly increasing oil prices could be deflationary or only marginally inflationary.  The Leebs assume that the oil embargo of the 1970s and the resulting inflationary spiral that occurred in the U.S. will occurr again as oil prices march steadily higher.  This logic is flawed for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that a steady, measured rise in prices allows time for the global economy to adapt to higher oil prices in ways that a sudden oil shock does not.    Furthermore, some economists argue that higher oil prices could be deflationary.  The Leebs ignore the fact that we are living in a globalized and highly competitive environment that is very different from the world of the late 70s.  If companies are having greater difficulty passing along higher energy costs to consumers; profit margins will contract, investment in R&D and new manufacturing capacity will slow, job groth will stagnate, and deflation will be as great, if not more of a threat, than inflation.  When manufactures are able to pass higher energy prices to consumers, the higher costs will tend to suppress demand thereby limiting economic and wage growth.    Personally, I think they got it wrong.  The Leebs do not support their basic premise that higher oil prices will lead to inflation; they accept it as received wisdom.  For this reason, everything that flows from their assumption of hyperinflation is flawed.  
 I found this book filled with far too much fluff and not enough valuable information.  The author told far too many stories and never really got to the point.  Generally I enjoy storytelling as a method of learning but this was over the top.  Go flip through the book before you buy to decide if it's worth it to you 
 I was disappointed when I received this book.  The title is very deceitful.  What the book really showed was posed photographs of rock stars and actors.  What was not shown were detailed photographs of tattoos, nor was there really any explanation or narrative about the individual photograph itself.  The book is weak and definately not for someone interested in tattoos.  However, if your interested in photographs of a few famous people, you should buy the book 
 I heard him talk, this guy is an idiot. A conspiracy theory is al this is 
 I had rated this book a "two" in relation to other Koontz books I have read. The book is entertaining enough, but is not very unique in relation to other books that Koontz has written. Koontz appears to have somewhat of a formula when creating main charachters. Often there is a primary charachter who appears to be rather basic at the beginning, but through later description becomes more complex due to an unusual background. Koontz books often have the aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background to overcome difficult obstacles usually in order to save a loved one.   I believe Koontz tries to express certain generalties, some of which have moral and religious undertones:  In the end, good overcomes evil and often evil by its destructive nature, destroys itself.  Love is worth fighting and dieing for.  Love is stronger than evil.  What does not kill you, makes you stronger.  Evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries.  The key to happiness is love, not material gain.   Evil lurks where you least expect it 
 Three things make me better than Sean Hannity: 1) I was actually in the US Military 2) I graduated college, unlike Sean 3) I don't believe that everybody who votes a certain way is a loser, or hates America. Sean Hannity is a bunch of hot air. Just watch him on FoxNews, or listen to him for one hour. He is yet another of the current line of conservative commentators who believes that all people who vote Democrat hate their country and hate all Republicans. Sean - stop labeling everybody. Every American has their own opinion 
 3 cups? I don't know where this teeny thing would equal that- not even 3 demitasse/espresso cups.  Amazon really should make the 'See larger image' say 'See life size' (try it)... or better yet show something for scale- like 10 coffee beans- the amount it holds.  So, I'm already kinda down on this Liliputian trinket and I check instructions to see if I can heat the water in the microwave- like I do with my other 'real size' French press (without the top).  No, nothing saying that should be a problem...  2 minutes later the rubber bottom mat is burning furiously in my microwave !  I'd hope Hugo had a 'BonJour' because I certainly didn't.. 
 This book of short vampire stories is BAD, BAD, and BAD. The books feels like it was put together in a matter of hours all in pursuit of the mighty dollar. The stories are meaningless, contrived, and a waste of the paper they were printed on. The ONLY REDEEMABLE story in the whole bunch was Angela Knight's Galahad. If she's smart, she'll turn that into a full story to add to her collection of Mageverse. Galahad's story was quite good. We actually read a plot that developed quickly and had a show-down between good and evil. It also explained how another of the three "unholy" grails was destroyed. I'm glad I bought the book simply for that particular story. Galahad deserves FIVE STARS but the book as a whole should simply be left out in the yard for the sun to destroy 
 I have been a long time fan of Brazilian music and own a huge collection of cd's from ballads to pulsating carnaval music. I agree with the reviewer who said this was garbage.  This is NOT Brazilian music.  It is repetitive, electronic "sound" that can become annoying and very boring.  It does not do justice to the mastery of the Brazilian musicians most of us admire.  If you are searching for a better representation of  Brazilian music I would recommend the cd "Chill Brazil" 
 The disc itself is very good, [...] The CD includes content protection that includes XCP software that can mess up your computer. Sony is recalling all the discs with this XCP-copy protection system and supposedly will replace them free of charge with another disc without the content protection. Go to http://cp.sonybmg.com/xcp/english/faq.html to find out about this and for a list of other Sony CDs that have this problem 
 I ordered this item and it stated that they were in stock.  Three weeks later I received a note from Amazon stating they could not locate one to ship to me and that my order had been canceled.  I was forced to go to an actual book store and buy it.  They were able to locate it for me 
 this is a sad attempt for the Liars at taking their sound in a new direction. It comes off as a hearted rip off of "Animal Collective's" "Feels" album, which was amazing. This disc doesn't live up to the hype surrounding it, and conventional wisdom is starting to tell me that Pitchfork has gotten too big for there britches 
 The decline of Christianity!  Right.  There aren't too many Christians around anymore.  Besides that obvious, astonishing oversight, I expected worse in regards to a biased perspective Crusades, and was appeased at the author's acknowledgement of the silmultaneous atrocities of Islam.  While attempting Biblical higher criticism assumes massive arrogance on the part of the critic, Johnson remains as balanced as one could expect.  But in the last analysis, Christianity is a lot more than a history, and claiming to be able to explain Christianity as a historical specimen assumes both monstrous egotism and unimaginable naivete 
 Another book of wishfull thinking and reflective racism all written under the guise of acadamia.  The author begins her premise by stating that when she was in school that she could not keep up with white students because of their competitiveness (read:bad white kids, bad bad.  Ladson wished that she had come from an idealistic afrocentric school where children learned and produced together (can anyone say Neo-Marxism)...    The majority of her book follows in typical order; Ladson claims that black children make up a unique cultural group whose very presence requirers that we all change our particular world views to fit theirs whether it may be destructive or not.     Ladson's main emphasis is on what she calls Culturally Relevant Teaching; ie., both color and culture do matter. Yet those who supposedly teach that way are just modeling a generic respectfull ethos and not a particular cultural standard as Ladson wants us to believe.    Only in the appendix of the book do we really understand the authors agenda.  Guess what? all bad things lead to the white man!!!...Ladson lauds  black feminists as "having developed an ethic of caring suggesting that personal emotions, expressiveness and empathy are central to knowledge (read black knowledge) and only black women have this....as for the white male he is dispassionate and objective!!  nuff said!!! 
 Don't buy this book. The Magic Lantern Guide, late though it is, is a much more comprehensive book.  The book's title is misleading. It's not a "field guide." A field guide would be a book dedicated to fully categorizing and explaining each of the camera's operating modes, controls and menu selections. This book simply regurgitates what's in the manufacturer's manual and then goes to boilerplate on how to make better photos. The things unique to the Nikon D200 are largely done by page 72. The remaining 178 pages is largely a generic digital photography volume.  All of the current DSLR cameras are amazingly feature-rich. They have complex architecture and much hidden capability. They also have capabilities that can actually get in the way if not properly understood and they have gee-whiz features that are most often best left alone. The manual that comes in the box explains each feature as if that feature were co-equal in importance with every other feature.  The fact is, some of the camera's feautures are very important. Some are less so. And which ones often depend on the type of photography being done. A good book on this camera would offer real-world explanations and advice with respect to the long list of capabilities represented by this camera.  The reality is that there is little to be gained from this book that is not available from the camera manual and from the photography books that you probably already own 
 Mr. Oski's book misses a very important point--the problem with milk and modern dairy foods is that we have processed them to death!  Raw milk from a healthy, pastured cow (not grain-fed) is one of nature's perfect foods.  While it is true that most of what is available in our grocery stores is poison, that is not the fault of the milk.  If you want to hear the other side of this very important story, read "The Untold Story of Milk: Green Pastures, Contented Cows and Raw Dairy Foods," by Ron Schmid, N.D.  Also, check out my book review for Robert Cohen's, "Milk: The Deadly Poison," which is also a very misleading book 
 Having never read a Koontz novel before I was looking forward to my first one. So I picked this up. Boy, what a disappointment. For 469 pages all I kept asking myself is what is going on? Why is this happening and what's the point of the entire book? In short, I felt the entire book was a big mess. Koontz co-wrote this book with someone else and it reads like it. It seems that these two guys were locked in separate rooms and wrote two different stories and never bothered to talk to one another while they were writing.  Characters pop up and storylines are laid out that lead to nowhere. One character, who happens to be autistic, can only walk while he completes imaginary crossword puzzles in his mind. Sounds interesting but his story has no plot or ending whatsoever. I have no idea how this characted is connected to the other characters in this book.  For almost the first 50% of this book deals with pieces of what I was hoping would be a much larger, more coherent puzzle. I was waiting for something to happen but it never did. If Frankenstein is still alive than only a few people were murdered and it seems no one actually cared except two cops. Hardly what I would call earth shaking considering who the killer(s) could be.   I think I'll pass on any further Koontz novels for now. I was never a big fiction fan but friends of mine talked me into testing the waters with Koontz, Patterson, Brown, etc. I think I'll go back to by non-fiction books for awhile and save this tripe for the beach 
 Try as I might I just could not find humor in this book.  So many times I wanted to put this book down and walk away but I thought, "This must get better."  It didn't.  LaFlam's character is spiritual selfish and so many times I felt offended reading this book.  There are so many twists and turns in this book that it seems like a Christian version of the Jerry Springer show.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who wants an enjoyable read, because for me it was not.  I apologize to the author for my harsh words, but I was very disappointed in this work 
 The first few reviews are too harsh,I was given this as a gift so I am not as pissed off at the money. I give it two stars could have been three but for the fact that the hero's are way too perfect and they are dull- but it was not a book I expected much from anyway.  The plot also gets way to over the top.  I mean is there any plane or helicopter they cannot learn to fly in a weekend? Hero's invited to the summit by the President! They escape four attempts to kill them before they even get to China! Also hero knew the guy was Chinese just by looking at him for a less than a minute, how many white folks can tell difference among non whites? Why are all the Chinese Americans bad guys as well?   The novel is way to heavy with anit Chinese comments, has lot of what are just rants. See the other points in the publisher weekly review, but after considering them you may want to read the book, if you want to consider what we do if we and china butt heads, but have low expectation and know that in this world the good guys always win. Do not expect much and look for used copy, I paln to look to see if any of his other books get any better reviews before I cut him off. 
 I was reading about my son.  It all sounded familiar and the concepts and suggestions made good sense.  Really talked about a framework of letting the decision making (and the consequence of their decision) remain with the teen. Then half way the book screeched in a new direction.  All of a sudden the book went from experienced practitioner point of view to subjective parent point of view.  When it comes to sex the authors don't want you to leave the decision with the teens, they want to take that one back, which weakens the premise they present.  The authors danced around abstinence while never taking a really firm position - which I would have respected, if not agreed with.  Then in the middle of that chapter one of the authors invokes Christ into the conversation/solution.  If I knew this book was written in context of a particular belief system, I wouldn't have spent the $22.  I would have wanted to know that in advance.  Tripping over this midbook has completely disappointed me and diminished the content and message of this book.  Buyer Bewar 
 All I wanted was to have an easy-to-use vacuum for my studio apartment. So I got this one for it's cheap and good for bare floor. Yet it died off at the first time I used it-rather tried to use it. It was on just for 20 mins, not continuously though. I had already emptied the bag for two times and my back was virtually broken when I used it. Anyway, if anyone from the Euro-Pro is reading the reviews on this product, they should recompensate all of us because I believe marketing such a product is kind of abusing customers! Don't waste your money on this product 
 Like "Jurassic Park", this book starts out promisingly but runs out of steam within just a few chapters. My reasons for such an accusation: 1. Crichton overloads the reader with scientific facts. And while these can be quite interesting, they often obstruct the action and progress of the storyline (Dan Brown, for instance, is a writer who can properly balance compelling action with factual sensitivity). As a result, the book comes off as slow and stumbling. 2. The plot isn't all that interesting to begin with. (Vengeful gorillas? Talking gorillas? Misanthropic gorillas? Come on.) 3. The book's ending is utterly terrible. 4. Cricton's writing is weak, and the characters are inconsistent and unconvincing.  Sorry, Michael, but this book just didn't do it for me 
 If you're going to read one of the great classics of literature-and you should-don't pick up this edition.  It is a reprint of a version that dates back to the 1870s and was exposed more than 40 years ago for cutting nearly one-quarter of Verne's story and mistranslating much of the remainder.  Its reappearance in this edition is all the more amazing considering Tor's status as a leading science fiction publisher, and the company's willingness to perpetrate this fraud on is many readers is truly stunning.  If you want to truly get to know Verne's novel, pick up the elegant Naval Institute Press edition, in a modern, complete, updated translation, with commentary by the leading American Verne expert today, Walter James Miller.  That book also comes with many of the artistic engravings that illustrated the original French first edition (no illustrations are to be found in the B&N Mercier reprint).  Less attractive but more academic is the Oxford Classics version of Twenty Thousand Leagues.  This review is posted on behalf of the North American Jules Verne Society by Jean-Michel Margot, president NAJVS 
 It's bad...pretty bad. And dull. I was expecting something different from this....it's almost unbearable to watch 
 It lasted one year and two weeks, then the motor died. While it worked it was great. I am tempted to buy a replacement, but will probably end up trying another brand. The manufacturer is probably banking on people buying several, because when they do work they do a great job 
 This book has excellent photo's of backyard ideas.  It is a great book if you are just looking for ideas.  I had expected a book with a little "how-to" mixed in 
 If you are looking for a Catholic Bible, this is not the one for you.  This Bible does not include the Deuterocanonicals/Apocrypha 
 Worked great for a couple months and then the gears stripped out. Guess you get what you pay for 
 Save your money. These cleaning wipes left streaks all over my monitor. A complete waste of money. The monitor looks worse than before.   I'd give it ZERO stars if I could.   Do NOT wast your money 
 "Why has Bodhi-Dharma Left for the East?" is a movie that takes place in a Buddhist hermitage deep in the mountains. The story is pretty simple : the Master is on the brink of death and tries to impart to one of his monks enlightenment about the cycle of life and death.  It's a contemplative movie, much like the Iranian stuff Kiarostami has made popular. So what we need to look at first are the images and the atmosphere. Well, it's very dissapointing. There are sparks of beauty and raw emotion here and there, but most of the images are murky, badly framed, and sometimes a stereotypical "city is bad, rural is good" pap. The DVD itself is TV-quality, and this detracts greatly from the shots. I don't care where (South Korea) or how (with one handheld camera) it was filmed, if it looks crappy, it can't be a good contemplative movie, period.  Not only is the theme of this story based on the bad side of Buddhist teachings - the idea that we must cut ourselves from the world and progress - but the images are not nearly good enough to sustain the movie. The idea was somewhat good, but the execution is terrible. Two stars 
 This book was not what I expected but mostly a review of the author's political outlook.  I got so bored that I did not finish reading the book 
 Despite all the gushing reviews about this book, a lot of it was just plain old common sense. As a mother to an almost 3 year old toddler (who, by the way was toilet training at 19 months and finished by 21 months without coercion), I found the book somewhat tedious. This book is a compendium for newbies but not for those who are more experienced and looking for "new" or additional information.  The section on toilet-training full of inaccurate old wives tales (from the 1970's when disposable diapers came into vogue). Too bad we DON'T take a cue from the 1960's and get our children OUT of diapers ASAP so that the landfills don't overrun with disposable diapers. It was offensive to those of us who don't wait until our child is 3.5 years old to toilet train them.  Her assertion that toddlers aren't ready for toilet training until they can control the anal sphincter muscles is untrue. Children CAN be trained by 1 - 2 years old, or those Europeans, Africans and Asians are doing something wrong!  She focuses too much on "fun and games" as if the toddler was not capable and interested in learning things like alphabets and counting (she makes it seem like if you do these things, you are an overbearing, overly ambitious and overly anxious mother). Do children HAVE to be entertained everywhere they go?   There are better books out there. This is not one I would buy. I would recommend Infant Potty Training : A Gentle and Primeval Method Adapted to Modern Living by Laurie Boucke for a better approach to toilet training. I would also not recommend waiting until your child was 3.5 either.  BTW, I don't have to entertain my child. She does just fine on her own and is able to amuse herself everywhere she goes without lots of paraphernalia. I allow her natural curiousity to engage with what's out there 
 Though Mr. Steyn does have strong opinions and some good observations, his judgements are tainted by an anti-gay bias (he titles one chapter "The Fags", and it's not meant affectionately).  His readings of stories such as the reaction of Lorenz Hart upon hearing "Oklahoma" in a blackout could have been better informed by further research, and he repeats Lerner's silly comment about Lorenz Hart being to short to be heterosexual so he had to turn to men.  The book is also dated in many respects including the waning influence of British Operettas and the public's acceptance of Stephen Sondheim.  Rather than this book I would reccommend anything by Ethan Mordden or Martin Gottfried 
 Compact design but cheap materials. A vital piece of plastic came off when I set it down on the bedstand. Another exhibit in the "you get what you pay for" sweepstakes. I threw it away 
 Starts off with a good murder scene and then drifts off into erudite intellectual fluff and nonsense which causes the murder mystery plot to disappear like dew in Dante's inferno. Very disappointing 
 I simply do not see any point in mixing Crime Fiction with Crime and Punishment.   
 I picked this book up because I was running out of decent mystery novels, and figured I was primed to love it given my obsession with the outdoors as well as mysteries.   It only gets two stars because I actually made it through. And I only got through it because I had nothing else to read.    I know Nevada Barr is a "name," and judging by the number of her books stocked in my local bookstore, a popular one. But I could list the things that are wrong with her writing for...well, let's just say more space than Amazon is going to give me for this review. Her prose is bad. Her imagery is unlively (and if you're going to write about a landscape like Anna Pigeon's, you sure as hell ought to be able to write it). Her characters range from the merely flat to the utterly ridiculous (Anna's romantic progression through this book: "Oh, I am widowed and my life will never be the same without my husband" to "Oh, it might be fun to be a lesbian" [an out-of-the-blue idea the author never bothers to resolve] to "Let me have a fling with this random man, who, by the way, has as much character as a cardboard cut-out").   Worst of all, she cheats. I guess mystery writers don't have an official code, but according to the Dorothy L Sayers model, Thou Shalt Not Give the Detective Clues Not Given To The Reader. A mystery novel is no fun if the puzzle isn't there for you too. Of course, if Nevada Barr had given us all the evidence she gives Anna Pigeon, there wouldn't be a mystery to have a novel about. Her cheating merely covers up her inability to produce an engaging and puzzling plot.   This was a pathetically sub-par book for the amount of attention it and its sequels have received. If you're looking for an amazing female detective, check out Laurie R King's two series, one about Sherlock Holmes' feminist partner Mary Russell (as unlikely as it sounds, and more than good enough to make up for it), and the other about San Francisco cop Kate Martinelli. If you want a book about living in the desert, I'd suggest Edward Abbey's _Desert Solitaire_ (it even has a brief appearance by a dead body), or his hilarious eco-terrorist adventure _The Monkey Wrench Gang_.   Anything but this 
 I share some bad experiences too.    I bought the E8 on Amazon and used it for 3 weeks.  It was working fine initially until I started using my Capresso beans, which were delivered to me just last week (made use of the Amazon rebate offer).  The machine seems stuck and there is no longer a clear stream of brewed coffee.  Instead, the coffee came out in droplets literally and the amount also dwindled.  The machine kept requesting that its tap be turned on.  I've stopped using it altogether and have emailed the Capresso customer service for assistance yesterday.  There's no point calling the toll-free number since I'm never home during office hours to go through the process.  This should not happen since the beans ought to be compatible in the first instance.    Other than that, I must say the machine is simple to use and very convenient.  Although I do agree with Roell that it does look cheap 
 Other than the power switch is not easy to see, the most issue with this microphone is the sound quality  not that good.  Use this microphone to record music for sure will disappoint you.  Even using it for church meeting recording, you would not get excited for its sound quality.  If you can tolerate the size of Sony ECM-MS907, you may like the sound quality of that microphone. If you like a small lapel microphone with true voice, try the AKG WMS-40 wireless system.  Our people are much happier with the AKG wireless microphone than this one.  
 I purchased a Treo 600 when it first came out. That phone was so bad that like an idiot I upgraded to a Treo 650. I was on Cingular with both phones. Onwing this phone and being with Cingular has been the most painful customer experience I have ever had. I'll spare you the details since they've been documented well elsewhere. I will add that After my 4th phone dying on me, I decided to cancel my service with Cingular, which renders my locked phone a $400 paperweight. I've gone over to Verizon and to a Samsung phone running the Windows OS. Palm was a good company once, now they have got their heads up their #&(&^$#(. Makes you wonder why the Treo 700 is running Windows now??? 
 I bought this DVD and it was a complete disaster, full of digital malfunction, you know, those black squares that look like a bad compression setting, and cuts in the audio, and this happens in more than half of the videos in the DVD, I saw another review of a guy who had the same problem so be careful people a lot of this DVD's seem to have this issue 
 Finally, after 343 pages of utter drivel, all the while searching for the buried qualities that would make 1) this a best-seller, 2) the critics hail this as his best since Garp, 3)it a good laugh, I threw it away in complete disgust and maddening frustration. I won't donate this book. I'll pretend I didn't waste good money on it, thank myself for not buying the hardback version at twice the price, already wary of Irving's decline.  Maybe Irving was playing with us, maybe he knows his substantial reputation would carry the day, maybe he just does not have it any more, maybe the critics should get a case of collective amnesia, forgetting Irving's past success with Garp, so that they could approach his work with unbiased faculties. Maybe.....I've been sucked into the Undertoad.  In any case I've never been more relieved to stop the torture arising from my dumbed down expectations about an Irving novel. I can't imagine I'd ever buy another one without sitting down and reading 50 pages before plunking down the cold cash to own one.   Boo.   
 I was expecting a total new book to use in my classroom around Halloween. This one seems to reprint information from her first two books including some information on locations that is not correct. Has she actually been to any of those locations, I was misled. If your looking for a book on folklore than this is for you,otherwise save your money if you have her first two books.    
 After reading this iconic work, I felt as if I had been ripped off with only myself to blame.  I should have known better.  The book is SOOOOOOO 70's!  I'll give it two stars simply because it's really so out-of-date it's almost campy.    Okay, early oil paintings depicted the upper classes with their "stuff" and the "stuff" of the upper classes.  So?  It's pretty elemental to figure out that those painters had to make a living and they painted for those who were able to pay them.    Duh.  Okay, women were depicted in oil paintings as possessions and, in turn, viewed themselves in the light of the value the possessor placed on them.  Deep and enlightening, huh?  It gets worse.  We get a healthy dose of the "capitalism is bad" philosophy and the hammering that advertising is meant to keep the masses enslaved to capitalism.  Nineteen seventies style collectivism is so boring.  Of course, Berger offers no alternative other than some passing reference to his vague definition of democracy.      Maybe it's just so out-dated, it's no longer relevant.  Maybe it played better to the 1970's.  Maybe we've heard this claptrap for so many years, it's no longer novel or meaningful.  And, maybe, it's because we've matured enough to realize criticism without any offering of alternatives is simply disingenuous and superficial 
 As mentioned earlier, this book is more like an introduction to c++ than it is an introduction to game programmnig for people already knowing c++.  I was so very very disapointed, when I got this book. I had the same interpretation of the title as Aaron F. Young (earlier review).   If you consider bying this book be careful to read other reviews, so you know that what you get is a book on c++ with game examples 
 I am a big fan of the show, and was disappointed that for so long, only a few episodes were available to purchase, and those were only on VHS. I was really happy when I heard they're releasing the complete series on DVD... but if you ask me, these DVDs are worse than having nothing at all.  The box advertises "complete, uncut" episodes and yet many episodes are missing scenes for no apparent reason. I can't imagine the reason for this. The DVD picture and sound quality are far worse than the VHS releases. How does that even happen? The episodes are also missing the introductions (which are different for each episode, depending on guest stars, etc)... left out for no reason. The DVDs also have no chapter stops whatsoever.  How does this happen in the modern day entertainment industry? No one in charge of product quality, no one even attempting to release something up to DVD standards, yet they hired someone to delete scenes that aren't crucial to the plot? I just don't get it... did they think DVDs have very limited space, and they have to take any steps necessary to reduce the length of the show?  The Little House series still appears on cable TV. You can literally get a much better quality product simply by taping the shows off of TV... this DVD release is a joke.  It's a bit frustrating to see so many shows (including older shows and less popular ones) are having great DVD releases, with great quality video and sound, and actor commentary despite the show being made decades ago... and then to see that Little House is treated so poorly 
 This version of the DVD promises on the cover that English OR English Closed Captioning is available. In fact, the menu provides only English with closed captions, with all the little sound descriptions like [water sloshing], [cattle lowing], [people muttering] which, while possibly useful to the hearing-impaired, are a constant irritation for a hearing, non-Swedish-speaking viewer. I'm returning this DVD and will wait 'til Fox gets their presentation right, in line with the features description on the case. Sheesh 
 Amazon should provide rating less than 1, like a 0 or -1. I would have rated this -1 or even lesser. Its not a massage chair, its a VIBRATOR Chair. As soon as I got the delivery, I started charging, but it only took 10 secs to know its vibrating instead of massaging. Immediately switched of , packed and returned. Its too good to be true that they're selling a massage chair for around $80 unless its a crap. I would go for one of those portable shiatsu massage 
 It used to be hard to fathom-but no longer. There are Americans who would say the following in describing Mexicans, legal or illegal:  **Since NAFTA was instituted, the rise of immigration, legal and illegal, has swept this once great country like a plague, and our government not only allows it to happen, but hastens it. I am not wealthy, and I am forced to live and work among these barbaric animals known as Mexicans. Our despicable government, which I would have at one time died for, has betrayed all American citizens by allowing this to happen.[i]  **"That hate is what defines these people. They don't care about legality, they just use illegal border crossing as an excuse. Their e-mails talk about "Third World vermin," "filthy Mexicans," "leeches, thieves," etc. Some use "mud people" to describe Mexicans..."[ii]  **"When you fight a war you don't fight it with rhetoric," Hernandez said. "When you fight a war, man, you go in and kill the enemy.... A signal has to be sent to Mexico and all those countries that we are tired of it and we're not going to put up with it."[iii]  **And if you think this is an isolated incident, here is a quote by one of the leading voices in the anti-Mexican movement, Frosty Wooldridge: "Ladies and gentlemen of America-we are LOSING all four factors. If you look around you, we are losing the cohesive thread of our society at over four million legal and illegal immigrants annually. They are not assimilating nor are they speaking our language."[iv]   I wonder "which" American society Frosty Wooldridge believes is losing its "cohesive thread"? Is he talking about the German-American, Irish-American, Italian-American, Chinese-American, Japanese-American societies? Or, is he talking about the Mexican-American communities one finds in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas?  Those who rant and rave about immigration and use such insipid arguments as "we are losing the cohesive thread of our society" never explain just what American society or culture they mean. You might be interested to know there are some anti-immigration extremists who refuse to acknowledge America is a nation built on, with, and by immigrants.   Laredo, Texas, is an American border town. It was founded by a Spanish officer, Don Tomas Sanchez de Barrera y Gallardo, who named the town Villa de San Agustin de Laredo after a town in Spain. In Laredo, Texas, the stores have bilingual signs and bilingual employees. Think of it-bilingualism in America! There are some pizza and Chinese restaurants but Mexican eateries line the streets. There is local Spanish television, radio, and newspapers. No one discriminates on the basis of which language is spoken.  Is this the "society" Frosty Wooldridge means when he says, "we are losing the cohesive thread of our society"?  Frosty and his anti-Mexican followers are not only confused most of the time in the questionable rhetoric they spew but are very loose with the facts. I have written extensively on one of the mainstays of their position-Mexicans are spreading diseases that America once conquered.[v]   Frosty, not an authority in epidemiology, insists that America is about to be wiped out from long-dormant diseases that Mexicans are spreading throughout America. And like sheep, the anti-Mexican guys accept Frosty's word over that of the CDC which tells me what Frosty claims and his following sheep accept as gospel is not true at all![vi]  Who are you going to call the next time you need some expertise regarding the spreading of infectious diseases: Frosty, an uncredentialed bicyclist and naturalist, or the Center for Disease Control?  Frosty and his followers' spin is nothing new. Read what Bill Steigerwald, Associate editor/columnist with the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review Pittsburgh, observed in 2003:  "Frosty the "snow" man?  Friday, November 21, 2003  Frosty Wooldridge has been peddling a screed[vii] - a version of which you ran ["Our Country Coming Undone," November 12] - to op-ed pages of newspapers claiming that it was illegal aliens who served up Hepatitis A to folks here at a Chi-Chi's.  Your site carried this b.s.  "You may have read in the newspapers: "... 34 children in a Michigan school tested positive for Tuberculosis"; or in Monaco, Pennsylvania, "Two people died of Hepatitis A," while 1,110 other patrons of Chi-Chi's Restaurants were 'served' the disease by six illegal alien employees."  I don't know how Frosty the snowman got this info, because we haven't heard it yet. I exchanged e-mails with him earlier the week of November 10, telling him he was either wrong or lying. (He had sent us an email pitching his op-ed).  Health officials here have had no idea how the problem here started (they still don't whether it came from an employee or a food source, such as green onions); no paper here has said a word about illegal or legal aliens.  Frosty's zeal, as I told him, has gotten the better of him. I wouldn't trust any of his "facts" without checking them. We'll never run anything he sends us.  "...he was either wrong or lying".-Need I say more?     
 Poorly organized, verbose writing style and most of all lacking in basic communications skills.  I'm not sure how an editor let this thing get published.  It contained virtually nothing I found useful and ranks as the worst golf instruction book I've ever read 
 ....into buying a book that talks about my baby learning to "manipulate me" if I nurse s/he to sleep or hold s/he "too much."  The authors in this book are also obviously not fans of nursing past 12 months OR allowing children to sleep with their parents-two key elements when discussing "attachment Parenting" which, according to Dr. William Sears, sets the ground stage for a happy toddlerhood.  Most of the gentle discipline techniques in this book are worth being reminded of, however, are truly common sense when dealing with a toddler and if are not already part of your daily parenting routine, basic parenting classes should DEFINATELY be a priority. Of course, no book can emphasize enough that hitting/slapping/spanking is inappropriate discipline (and this book does a great job of that), but I feel if you are reading this book you probably already know that and are looking for better answers.  I recommend "Kids are Worth It" by Barbara Coloroso instead. Most of the gentle discipline techniqes parallel each other in a reading environment that gives more confidence in parental lifestyle choice. Also, "The Discipline Book" by the Sears' is a definite keeper 
 ...all of which are well deserved. This is an extremely well played piece. The individual phrases are beautiful but... Try this thought experiment. Imagine you have never heard the "To be or not to be" speech from Hamlet. You know nothing of the train of its thought, the beauty of its English, its cultural resonance. Now imagine that you are hearing it performed by one of our greatest interpreters, an Olivier, a Burton or a Kline. Someone with a truely beautiful voice. Now imagine them intoning the speech softly speaking one word every 20 to 30 seconds or so but at irregular intervals. Could you follow the flow of the argument, could you hear the flow of the poetry? Would you want to? Sure, especially with repeated listenings, you could put it all together but would you enjoy the poetry as much as you would if it were spoken at a normal rate? Now read the reviews below. They speak of the concentration, of the need to learn how to hear this piece. I understand that some music requires that and have been willing to do that work many times. Music is a demanding mistress. But with this piece, I just don't hear it even after repeated listenings. For me, there is little payback. It is one thing to hold a phrase in your ears long enough to try to relate it to something heard twenty seconds ago, it is another to relate both of those to something heard fourty-three seconds earlier and so forth. For me this piece does nothing more than establish the limits of my ability to contextualize isolated phrases played at extended irregular intervals. Having established that I am ready to move on to something more meaningful for me. As always, the above rant claims to be representative only of my own point of view. The other reviewers, many of whom I respect and read in order to learn from, feel very differently. I will say this. Feldman is a great composer, no argument there. So it might well be worth your time listening to this CD to discover your own reaction. But don't say no one warned you. 
 Santayana is known broadly as the guy who said that those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it -- whatever that means. And therein lies, in miniature, the charm of this tireless windbag, most of whose vast output is thankfully out of print. The statement in itself means precisely nothing, and its perfect emptiness is what renders it most useful. It requires a trememdous volume of ignorance to make Santayana profound, which is, I suppose, why he was for so long America's national philosopher. If you expect philosophers to be blowhards, then Santayana will never disappoint you. For the rest of us, instead of this volume and the five-volume bolus of which it is the condensate, one can read William James' essay "The Sentiment of Rationality," the wisdom of which it, as it were, repeats 
 I read this book a few years ago, along with another one by the same author, Care of The Soul.  I found his books informative, though difficult to read because of the writing style.  Since, I have read many other books that address the same issues in a much "simpler form."  I noticed that the price for used books is very low, this should tell you most of what you need to know 
 Although Gundry does well in this introductory book to give the reader pronunciation guides for names of persons, his syntax is incredibly poor.  Because his sentence structure is lacking, his intended meaning is confusing and requires at times a multiple read in order to make sense of his sentence 
 While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging 
 Disappointing to say the least.  Over 90% of the writing in this book was in book one - The Prodigal Son.  I find it hard to believe Koontz can release this in good conscience.  There are perhaps an additional 20-30 pages of new material in this book.  Save your money and go straight to book 3 
 I actually did buy and read the book, as it seems many here in the review section did not.  I did so because I'm very interested in biography and memoir as a genre, and because I thought Anna Nicole Smith was an interesting example of the blonde bombshell archetype.  Upon reading the book, what I discovered is that the author is still in a state of confusion as to how she feels about her half-sister, as is, apparently, the whole family.  It must be noted that Donna Hogan reveals some awful truths about Anna Nicole's father:  that he was a child molester, child abuser, and torturer of animals, all signs of a sociopathic personality.  The fallout was horrible--all of the family wounded and in a state of anger, hurt, and confusion.  And though Donna Hogan doesn't reveal much about Anna Nicole's mother, she does include Virgie's birth date, which would make Virgie a teenager when she gave birth to Anna.  Clearly, Anna Nicole had an absolutely god-awful childhood.  So when we've seen Anna's family members go on television and claim that everything was hunky dory and the real problem was "Vickie," clearly they are not telling the truth--or they are too embroiled in the mess to see the truth.  The family was dysfunctional with a capital "D" and Anna Nicole did miraculously well to get out and become a success on any level.  Which brings us back to Donna Hogan.  My heart goes out to her.  Unlike her half-sister Anna Nicole, Donna couldn't escape the horrific mess that was her family and she has struggled to overcome their painful legacy.  Like a child of abusers, she on the one hand claims that the family was dysfuctional, and on the other she claims that Anna "abandoned" them.  She on the one hand claims that the family is respectable and not "trailer trash," and on the other hand gives reason after reason that it is.  She contradicts herself over and over throughout the book.  It's pretty clear that Donna simply hasn't sorted it all out yet and I think at the bottom of it she was angry with Anna for having the ability to leave the family when she herself has not.    Of course the sad thing for Anna Nicole Smith is that, though she physically left her abusive family, she carried a lot of pain around with her all her life.  The prescription drug use makes absolute sense in light of her horrific background.  And I imagine that when Anna's mother accused her and Howard Stern of having a hand in killing her son Daniel, Anna Nicole had about as much as she could take.  Why continue on in a world where your own mother was capable of such cruelty?  For me, her mother's accusation was the nail in Anna Nicole's coffin.  Finally, I was absolutely gob-smacked that Donna Hogan would call her own sister a "train wreck."  She claims in her book that she was deeply hurt that Anna Nicole left her.  Would you stay in touch with a sister who calls you a "train wreck"?  I think that one day Donna will sort out her feelings about Anna and her family, but that today it's still a jumble of anger, hurt, and confusion.  When she does sort it out, I think she might realize that she did a hurtful thing in writing this book with the scathingly critical tone she did.  I hope that she gets away completely from her "family."  Too bad her sister wasn't able to ever truly get away 
 This used to be the only choice of recording for this enchanting children's masterpiece and I enjoyed listening to it for years.  However, this old mono recording has been surpassed by a much superior new recording made by the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in a production directed by the composer himself, Gian Carlo Menotti.  If you want the best recording of Amahl, get the other one.  This is old recording is good, but the newer recording is much better 
 Prof. Levenson is good at finding and connecting themes within biblical literature.  But what would have been far more interesting and useful is for him to have opened up the lens and compared the sacrificial myths he treats here with those in cultures outside the Judeo-Christian world.  As  it is, the book is myopic 
 nothing really extraordinary here.  lots of slandering dark-skinned peoples with the word "savages" thereby excusing genocidal and land-grabbing actions by the more "civilized" Xtian believing "aryans" who of course have evolved beyond all that superstition by emblazoning their one true god on their only appropriate place of worship--dollar bills 
 The story is the same and just as wonderful as it has always been.  I bought the CD version for a car trip, and was extremely disappointed in the narration.  It was read rapidly, and without pause.  I found that, even though I know the story well, I could hardly keep up!  I have several other books on CD, and have not had this problem.  Too bad... it was a waste of money, and a long boring car trip 
 Seriously anyone who gives this 5 stars is only do'in it cause DMX is on that one listenable track. This is not what the lox is all about. Pop bubblegum beats and radio friendly lyrics. Thats Puffs doing. If you really want to hear what the lox is all about, cop they solo album's and We are the streets. This album you can definetly tell Puffs pullin they strings 
 Yet another album that concentrates on those synth-cheese melodies. Mu-Ziq just keeps on kicking the horse, and does so with less beat programming talent than Squarepusher or Venetian Snares, and less charisma than Aphex Twin, or heck, Barry Manilow. Perhaps because i'm taking it from a 2004 perspective, it doesn't measure up to modern electronica in the same vein; perhaps it's an unfair comparison. But as a person currently living in 2004, i'd download 'Hasty Boom Alert' and 'Midwinter Log' and move on to an artist with an idea that's less than 5 years old. A bland, repetitive, unimportant album that you'll barely listen to once 
 I went through 2 of these in as many months - the sound quality was very spotty and the mic would intermittently quit working. People regularly had a hard time understanding me when the mic was working and the voice recognition on my cell phone couldn't even distinguish between 'yes' and 'no.' 
 This is truly a disappointing book.  It starts incredibly slowly and I found it very hard to become interested in the plot.  Another disappointment is Koontz's recycling of elements from other novels: (1) plucky, highly intelligent disabled girl (the young female protagonist in "The Hideaway" had almost identical deformities and personality), (2) devoted, super-powered canine companions, (3) bad guys driving around in ultra pimped-out RVs, and (4) evil bioethicists.  The Leilani character is patently ridiculous.  She conveniently has a genius IQ, but that does not make the absurdly adult manner in which she speaks any more believable.  I found it so disconcerting as to detract from the plot.  Koontz clearly has trouble writing for children, and this book is no exception.  Almost all the children featured in his books are either autistic/MR or genius wunderkinds; the latter, however, does not justify his habit of making smart children talk like genius adults.  Dean heaps the hardships on poor Leilani, with all the subtlety of an episode of Walker, Texas Ranger.  In case you miss the anvils, you are supposed to really, really like her and fear for her safety.  I don't know how or where Dean Koontz learned about bioethics, but he has a terribly misguided view of the field, taking an extreme sect of it to represent the main viewpoint of the field.  Further, he states multiple times that these eugenic bioethics principles are being taught to medical students at major universities (who will have to pay for their involvement with evil bioethics) -- as a medical student, I can assure you that this is patently untrue.  That Koontz could be so off-base on a topic that directly relates to the central motive is disconcerting and makes an already weak book even harder to swallow.  The final issue is Koontz's near-deification of dogs, particularly Golden Retrievers, which is a common motif in his more recent works.  It is ridiculous and unintentionally funny to an almost painful degree.  His obsession with dogs and their mystical powers borders on the psychotic (and I like dogs).  This novel probably features the most egregious example of Koontz's tendency to create overly sappy, sugary-sweet endings.  Dean Koontz has written many books better than this one.  Spend your money on one of his stronger efforts 
 When I read this, I was not expecting to become a commie, but at least I was hoping for something more compelling than the pure hatred of people who have more than others and the racist concsipracy theories (especially re Jews) that the authors came up with.    I understand that people accord this book some respect because it has influcenced many people.  But that is what hate litterature does.  This book is especially powerful in its attempt to find sharp class lines to allow the "masses" to hate 
 I am embarrased to say it, but I've read this book at least 10 times.  The nightmare began some 8 years ago when at the urging of a "friend" I entered rehab for what would become the first of many such "treatments". The indoctrination process began immediately. "The first 163 pages will save your ..." was just one of the things I was told by some washed up alcoholic who once resorted to drinking Sterno while living homeless in some ravine.  It never stopped. Go to enough AA meetings and you'll hear the same things over and over and over...you get the idea. How quickly we (newcomers) were brainwashed. For me there was always an uneasy feeling. It was creepy to hear those who were only days out of rehab sound off parroting the same sentiments and cliches of their sponsors. An ominous warning I should have paid attention to.   Years later I realize that I was one of the unfortunate souls that was swept away into a religious cult with the help of counselors, social workers, 12 steppers and even doctors. I became sicker, despondent and my drinking and using worsened.  My sanity was replaced with the belief that I was powerless and my only hope was within "the Program". There's a good reason they call it your "Program". I became a 12 step automaton immersing myself deeper into the religiousity of AA with each successive relapse. I did it all. A meeting every day, working the steps, attending step studies, service work, conventions, retreats...you name it-I did it. I surrendered common sense and reason and followed the direction of 12 step fruitcakes. If you are newly sober and looking for help look elsewhere. This book is a waste of time and may even be hazardous to your health. If it's a support group you think you need go to a Life Ring meeting or better yet stay home and read Rational Recovery or one of Ellis' books. Do not go to  12 step meetings. I haven't been to an AA meeting in close to 2 years and I am finally sober and happy. Go figure. Stay away from 12 steppers. It took me years to come to this realization and that is this - Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are more concerned with AA than they are with helping people stay sober. Just take a look at the numbers. The vast majority of recovered addicts/alcoholics recover without 12 step involvement. AA and its evil spawn NA have hurt more people than they have helped. 
   This book is filthy.  I had to take a shower after I read it.  Why doesn't he get a job?  Why does he have to live in France? Why doesn't he save his money instead of investing it in alcohol and hookers?  So many questions.  People just think this book deserves a place on the same shelf as say James Michenier because it was banned.  It was banned because it's a bad book 
 Even though this is a "popular" version of the theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not so easy as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than a high-school knowledge. It might be true in his time, but nowadays the book demands a longer study in Physics. I offer myself as an example: I'm a literature student in post-graduation level, and simply couldn't grasp the meaning of many mathematical demonstrations he uses to make his points. His reasoning is also obscure in many passages (what are really those 'galilean coordinates'?). Perhaps these details seem self-evident for professional readers, but they are not for the general public (the implied target of the book). In brief, Einstein didn't succeed completely in his attempt at popularization.  
 Swartzwelder is the best writer on the Simpsons staff, bar none. But his prose style leaves so much to be desired. What works within the context of a voiced animated show falls flat on its face in print.  Swartzwelder revisits the character of Frank Burly, P.I., last seen in "The Time Machine Did It". That earlier novel worked, even though the joke got a litle long-in-the-tooth at the end. Here, the attempt to once again meld film-noirish black-and-white movie cliches with 50s-ish science fiction, this time an alien invasion that only Burly is too stupid to realize is happening, cannot even elicit a guffaw.  Some may feel Burly is simply Homer recast as Phillip Marlowe. But even Homer would remember to be, you know...funny. In this case, the formula very quickly becomes. Burly almost discovers invasion, incident causes Burly great pain, Burly forgets there is an invasion. It just does not hold up.  Maybe those who read this book without reading its predeccesor will enjoy it more as they will be unfamiliar with the formula. For those who are attracted purely by the "writer of the Simpsons" blurb, you're better off buying any of the DVDs and passing on this.  
 i downloaded it and i couldn't view the video paste the intro. then i RE-downloaded it thinking that maybe it was a corrupt file, but it again it only had sound and not video. this one is a waste of money 
 This book is an nice collection of differing points of views about latinos/hispanics. However it's primarily philisophical. It's more confusing than inspiring. It's great for those studying for a phD, but will not inspire average latinos to action. This book tilts slightly more towards the assimilationist point of view, although a few writers do express some pan-latino thoughts. 
 The package the book came in was smashed. The book appeared as if it had been used. It took over 2 weeks for it to arrive. I wouldn't order any books from amazon agai 
 I was looking for a compass to put on my daughters bike and bought a couple of these.  It does not work very well wether it is on the bike or away from the bike 
 My god, this album is terrible, it sounds like music for a kids Saturday morning TV show. Needless to say I'm unimpressed by this bubblegum junk. It's just more musical kleenex; use it, then lose it. A huge letdown after the previous two albums; especially "Under My Skin." Check out Stefy's Orange Album for some good pop rock that you'll want to hold on to long after you've laid down your hard earned money 
 For me, Krazy Kat by Jay Cantor was the third in a sort-of trilogy of novels that retold the stories of various comic book type characters.  Zorro (maybe not a comic book hero, but definitely close in fashion) by Isabel Allende and It's Superman by Tom DeHaven were retellings that were faithful to the original characters and stories and both were delights to read.  Krazy Kat is not, but it's not the fact that it is revisionist that makes this book fail; instead it's the fact that it's a mess.  For those unfamiliar with Krazy Kat the comic strip, this book should definitely be avoided, as it would be like trying to watch a single episode of a serial and understanding instantly what's going on:  it just won't happen.  You need the history to get the present picture.  But for those who dare go in without this familiarity, I offer this brief description:  Krazy Kat was a comic strip that ran in the first half of the 20th century.  Krazy was the main character, who loved Ignatz the Mouse.  Ignatz did not return the feelings, instead choosing to constantly bean Krazy Kat in the head with a brick.  But Krazy only thought of this as a sign of affection.  The third character was Offisa Pup, who loved Krazy and would run Ignatz off to jail.    It was a simple concept, but brilliantly executed, so through the decades, the strip remained fresh and is considered by some to be the best comic strip ever.  In particular, it was a favorite of various big name celebrities such as Walt Disney and Charlie Chaplin.  Even now, among its fans, Krazy Kat is considered more than a comic strip.  It is considered art.  Cantor's novel focuses on the premise that Krazy and Ignatz viewed the atomic bomb test in 1945 New Mexico.  For Krazy, this forced her (Krazy's gender tended to fluctuate in the strip) to accept reality in a way she never had before.  Suddenly, the bricks began to hurt.  Krazy retires from the strip and becomes something of a recluse.  Ignatz, who wants to get back to work, tries to cure her.  The novel is told in five sections:  the first section tells of the onset of Krazy's problems.  The second section deals with Ignatz's psychoanalysis.  The third has them getting involved with motion pictures; the fourth with them joining a revolutionary group and the final one deals with their "romance" in an off-beat manner.  I imagine that this novel would have a very limited appeal.  First of all, it would only be read by those familiar with Krazy Kat, but many of those people would be fans and would view this as a desecration of their favorite characters, especially in the last, mildly pornographic portion of the book.  So it would only possibly appeal to those who can take the abuse these characters will get.  Fan as I am of the strip, I'd still be willing to read something revisionist if it was done well, but here it isn't.  This book, as stated before, is a mess.  Cantor, in his attempt to be literary, often fails in his attempt to be readable.  This book was a bit of a chore to read, with barely enough quality to merit two stars.  The humor is either overly subtle or like that brick to the head.  This may be one of those books that gets better the more times it's read, but I don't know if it's worth the effort.  My recommendation is to skip this book and buy a collection of the original strips instead (many of which will cost almost the same). 
 The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:      1.  I thought "sheer" meant sheer.      2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed) 
 I ordered this item in late November, got a shipping notice on December 4th, and it took until December 22 for it to arrive to it's destination.  Customer service blamed problems with FEDEX, FEDEX blamed the company.  I would NOT order from this company.  I got the runaround for 2 weeks and item arrived 1 week later than what it was promised 
 We received the video, but it was blank--with nothing recorded on it. I'm waiting to hear from Amazon as to how to get the issue reconciled 
 ...unless it is rock and roll played by ac/dc. i f***ing HATE them. they are overplayed so much on the radio, and that is the most annoying voice i have ever heard in my life. don't waste your money on this cd, just turn on the radio...then turn it off 
 This is one of the many books written by professors at universities in order to get tenure. It is not written for the average reader but for other professors who already have an understanding of the subject matter. For that matter, I wonder why the author would make his book available to the general public and not make his material accessable to them. The book is dense, the author focuses more on referencing other authors rather than providing a clear, concise or original thesis to the subject. I dont not recommend this book if you are one of the billions of people out there who is not a professor at whichever universities this author was trying to impress 
 Beneath the Remains, Sepultura's 3rd album from 1989  This album, along with Chaos A.D. and Arise, is considered to be the embodiment of Sepultura's classic era, and many fans consider this to be one of the finest, if not the finest installment in the band's catalog. With that said, this disc offers straight ahead thrash metal and little else. There are a lot of great riffs, great solos, and a lot of time changes, which will be enough to whet the appetite of many metal fans. Be that as it may, though, you should be warned that the boys really did not make an inspired effort on this record. It's basically just a slash and shred metal record with very little creativity or personality. An album like this really can't stack up against some of the greatest creative works of the genre, such as Metallica's ...And Justice For All, Iron Maiden's Powerslave, or Megadeth's Rust In Peace. I would give a track-by-track evaluation, but nothing really stands out here. I also have a gripe with Max Cavalera's vocals. I was really not pleased with what I heard from him, as his vocal style was not very well developed at this point in his career. Andreas Kisser and Cavalera sound pretty good on guitar. The standout track would probably be "Slaves of Pain." There's a great little bit around the two minute mark where Cavalera sings, "Open your eyes / Don't lose your steps / Liberty is a dream / And it also is real," then it slides into a spine chilling riff and a great solo. Drummer Igor Cavalera also turns in a pretty decent performance. This disc has something to offer, but what I've come to find is that there are some albums that really captivate you and there are some albums that you just can't get into no matter what you do. Unfortunately, Beneath the Remains fell into the latter category for me. 
 It's not just that If lucy Fell is a bad film. 90% of what comes out of Hollywood is uninspired, formulaic dross just like it, and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it. What makes this movie memorably, remarkably bad is writer/director/star Eric Schaeffer's nauseatingly immense sense of self-regard, which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday's roadkill. The mere fact that the photogenically-challenged Mr. Schaeffer should have the likes of Elle MacPherson tell him he's "cute" speaks volumes 
 Born Confused follows the life of the culture-confused main character, Dimple Lala.  Now I have to say, I know little about Indian cultures, but it seemed to me that Dimple didn't know so much herself. I do have experience with parents, of course, so her parents' reaction when she came home drunk was entirely unrealistic. My huge complaint is that the author portrays getting drunk and stoned as hilarious. The entire story, Dimple keeps saying how she never does anything wrong, but when her best friend says to drink or smoke marijuana she immediately does so, without question. God forbid if she had been told to do anything worse. Please, do not teach teens that smoking grass is a good thing. Is this author out of her mind???  Then, there was the friend, Gwynn, who was no friend at all. She was probably one of the most selfish characters I have ever come across, ex: taking her friend's clothes without asking, divulging her deepest secrets to a total stranger, who just so happens to be the boy she is after while her friend, Dimple, is sitting right there, she throws her best friend aside as soon as she gets a boyfriend, and when the time comes to apologize, she lays it all on Dimple's shoulders. If I had a friend like her I wouldn't stand that kind of treatment, but Dimple did. Even when she confronted Gwynn, nothing seemed to come of it, in my opinion. Dimple was a major pushover, and the ending, although everything is magically resolved in one year in the story, would not be in real life. Dimple was a kind, sympathetic character. She deserved a better friend and a backbone. Also, the author sometimes got carried away with descriptions...  At the moment, I'm having trouble remembering any good points. I think I liked it somewhat at the time I was reading it, but that feeling has left me completely.  Overall: another over-hyped book.  
 This book offers absolutely nothing of value.  As a person who sews, I was very disappointed 
 Extremely difficult to dig through the excessive examples in order to find the relevant theorems and results. Because of this, the problems at the end of each chapter become exercises in tedium, as more time is spent searching for the necessary theorems in the text than in actually working out the solution.   I do not recommend 
 I am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review.  This movie is neither good nor bad; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript.  To compare it to "Run Lola Run" is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology I would recommend "Cube".   
 I do not believe this book can even be considered a guide book. No topos for certain areas. Poor descriptions. I went to Red Rocks with this book and it only got me to where I needed to park. I used the kindness of locals to get me to where I needed to go. Don't waste your time on this book. It's a pile 
 Please advise me if I can get a new Plu in senor Temp wire plug in this item come in defective and dont work? Please advise ASAP  Thanks Walter Ga 
 Taylor Dane has topped the US pop, dance and adult contemporary charts.   But the real test for blue-eyed soul is the US R&B chart. A single song that peaked at number 21?  She is just another blonde babe with a decent if indistinguishable voice (but she sure does look good in those videos, doesn't she?).  For the real goods, check out Lisa Stansfield or Teena Marie 
 Ok so I have always thought Courteney Cox should not be allowed on screen due to lack of acting talent and this show just proves it. It really is the most boring show Ive seen in a long time. If you thought she was bad in scream...and friends..dont watch this...there are other actors in this show who do redeem it somewhat but could never save it. Hopefully this show will be scraped 
 What a disappointment.  The spinner just can't gain enough speed to do anything lilke what it is supposed to do.  Overall, it's  a cheap item with limited supplies for the $ 
   I really liked it at first.  It gave consistent readings that were clear and easy to understand.  I wouldn't say I was rough with it at all but somehow it broke.  The tab that holds the little door closed for the batteries broke off without any misuse. 
 I couldn't tell you who this book was about, but it certainly wasn't Elizabeth I.  Portrayed by Gregory as a dependent almost stupid neurotic, this estimation of her character flies in the face of all accepted scholarship.  And the writing isn't so hot, either.  If I had to read one more time that Elizabeth was picking her cuticles, I would have gone mad.  The Other Boleyn Girl is a much better effort 
 Although this author has an interesting story going, you have to wade through pages of annoying chatter to find it. It has been noted that this author can take ten pages to say absolutely nothing, and this is true. At  time his condesending prose directed at the reader is a bit irratiating and  one longs for his return to the story 
 This book was really a disappointment. Some passages were lifted verbatim from her other books--which made me feel ripped off. In "Moving On," she describes how the clutter in her house got out of control to the point where she had a psychic specialist come in. The psychic said the house was "weeping." Sarah then found out soon after that her husband was having an affair and the house was "protecting" her with its clutter. That's an interesting enough story--EXCEPT that she told the exact same story in "Simple Abundance," only the person having the cluttered house problem was her friend--not Sarah. So, which story are we supposed to believe?  This book seems so thrown together. I think she should've taken another year or so to flesh it out, to use all new stories and to find a really good editor.   I just don't feel the same about any of her books now 
 After less than 1 year, I bought an oven thermometer to find out why the oven was cooking so slowly.  After 45 minutes set at 450 degrees, it only reached 200 degrees.  Consumer service is a joke, unless you like listening to a computer.  I never could reach a human at Toastmaster/Salton. The elements come on, nice and red, but no heat 
 It is difficult to get through this book, mailnly because John Douglas seems to spend more time praising himself than actually providing the reader with interesting and unbiased information. Contrary to what Douglas may think, there are other profilers out there with just as much expertise whose books are much more fascinating to read. I suggest that you read one of them instead 
 I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused.  I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain.  If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe 
 I love Putumayo Kids collections because I find them to be great for adults too, but this is an exception.  This CD is the only exception, I don't find the instrumentals or lyrics fun, or interesting on this CD- not something I want to listen to 
 First let me say that i am a composer and die hard musician. i just watched this movie to learn what i could about this supposed genius, and i could barely keep from turning it off, actually, i did turn it off. quite unattractive really. turns out Beethoven was an insane jerk and his lifestlye was not intersting to me at all. he may have been a great musician, but that is not really the focus of this movie. in fact, there is no focus in this movie, except that he was a jerk.     If you want to watch a great movie about a great man, I suggest the "The Endurance". Enrest Shackleton will make you want to punch people like this Beethoven character.  It will blow you away. 
 I agree with the rest of the reviews.  I've read this series since its' inception, and enjoyed almost all of the books.  The sex has gotten stanger and more prevelant, but even through the last book it was still an adjunct to the plot.  This one however has nothing BUT sex.  No plot, no action.  If you took out all pages which contain sex you wouldn't have 5% of the book left 
 Mystery with an interesting twist.  Why not write good stuff WITHOUT all the foul language?  The cursing and taking God's name in vain doesn't make it more of a mystery, it makes it low level reading.  How about raising the standard and give your characters something new to say when excited and scared? 
 This product was useless. I was trying to fix my screen and all it did was make things worse. I got a microfiber cloth and everything and nothing seemed to happen. It's not worth the money. 
 OK, I get it. I understand that Art Brut are tongue-in-cheek, and that it's the classic stance of hating rock&roll and loving it at the same time. OH the ambivalence of it all. My main quip is with vocals. Rarely do I enjoy snotty brit twang, and this album did not get a pass. Eddie Argos's vocals are so grating, I hardly got past the first two songs. The music itself is nothing original (much like the lyrics), but is catchy and fun, at times. Basically, the state of Rock & Roll is easy to bash, poke fun at, and criticize. So if you're going to do it, at least have some lyrics that are indeed funny, insightful or otherwise, and not just noting what is already known. As a music and R&R fan, I have to say that this album's worth is overrated and hyped by critics and fans, while Art Brut is laughing at us (rightfully so). If that's what salts your corn, dive in 
 OK.  I'll admit this review might be unfair.  I didn't even finish the book.  I might have missed some real gems. But, since I didn't finish it, I thought I should explain why.  I found the essays to be well written but the guys I just couldn't have a lot of empathy for or really understand the point behind many of the essays.  The Boy Toy, the guy who was proud of his "threesome" affairs (as a regular fare), the man looking for a "Female John Wayne", the guy whose wife had an affair that he "forgave" her for and then spent 7 years wallowing in the relationship, had an affair of his own and returned to find her in the arms of a woman", these are "typical" guys?  Maybe on Jerry Springer.  Not all of the essays were completely bad.  The 47 year bachelor had some interesting things to say.  The guy with the open marriage was refreshingly honest (even though he didn't use his real name) about the inherent problems with "open" relationship (although I still think he's fooling himself).  The essay about the guy who was short-tempered with his children almost actually hit home.  But, overall the book is not worth my time to finish.  I am a 45 year old, happily married father of 2. I have been married for 15 years. I had a pretty decent life before marriage and can actually remember those days pretty well.  I picked up this book looking for some light reading and maybe some insight as to what makes men tick.  I freely admit, I'm not your typical guy.  I thought it would interesting and entertaining.  I made it through the first five or six essays.  I didn't keep count.  Normally, I'll plow through a book no matter how bad it starts off. But, I decided to put this one down last night and probably won't pick it up again.  Maybe my wife will read it when Oprah decides to put it on her list.  Women would just love to bash men with this one 
 I originally wrote a review of this book in 1999, titled "This is a racist book disguised as a work of art."  It seems that I didn't explain well enough my objection to Styron's co-opting of the story of a real human being, Nat Turner, whose story was more accurately depicted in the 1831 book, "The Confessions of Nat Turner," by T.R. Gray.  Not only did Styron steal the title of Gray's book, in which Gray recounts his interview with the real Nat Turner, but the incidents Styron invents for the sake of drama reveal his southern-bred racism.    Unlike his depiction in Styron's book, Nat Turner was married.  Styron's invention of Turner's pivotal and conflicted relationship with a white woman, Margaret Whitehead, is entirely fictional.  So is any self-doubt that Turner did the right thing by leading the revolt.  In Gray's account, Turner did not express regret. There is so much more depth to Turner's life that is either fictionalized beyond recognition or left unexplored in this book.  Do those facts make a difference in a work of fiction?  Yes. The parts Styron has unnecessarily fictionalized are key to the story he invented.  Turner's fictional relationship with Margaret is saturated in the southern myth that black men are obsessed with white women -- lusting for the forbidden fruit, for which they must die.  That Styron crawls into Nat Turner's skin in order to infect him with self-doubt about his mission emasculates Turner and diminishes his cause.  What offends me most is that Nat Turner's life deserves to be explored by a modern author who does not condescend or patronize this African-American hero.  Instead, we have William Styron's version of Turner's life, taken by many readers as fact.  If one prefers racist fiction posing as a legitimate account of a life, then one might enjoy wallowing in this version of "Confessions."  But if one prefers reality, I recommend Gray's book as well as other accounts available about the slave revolt at Southampton, Virginia.  Styron's book does not provide significant insights into Nat Turner, slave revolt or slavery itself.  His book clouds the truth with the same kind of Reconstruction era distortions that spawned the hideous phenomenon of lynching 
 I found this to be extremely difficult to follow. The dialogue does not follow the text in the book, jumps suddenly to another section. The CDs are poorly recorded and in many instances two people are talking at the same time e.g. on top of one another which really threw me. So not only was I always rushing to catch up and figure out where I was but the existing text is not comprehensive and jumps around. Then whenever the recording had one of its many glitches I had to start from the beginning again. I would prefer word by word text in Italian AND in English so that I can see how the words are spelled in Italian and retention of the translation would have been easier 
 The book presents translation theory and information on the history of translation.  It lists proverbs with their translations as well as cognates and false cognates.  There's humorous examples of bad translations.  Therefore, after reading it, you will know how to evaluate the quality of a translation without having been given much practice in translating.  If you're looking for a book on translation theory, this will be a fine introduction.  It isn't as good if you need to learn to translate 
 I have read Baldacci's first four novels and have immensely enjoyed all of them.  This one, however, is just awful.  Not only the character's dialogue but even the story itself is written like a really bad detective movie.  The only thing I can think of to compare it to is this :  There was a series of Calvin and Hobbes cartoons where Calvin imagines himself as a private detective and they are written like the old detective shows, with lame lines like "The gun was loaded, and so was I".  That is exactly what this book is like, except it goes on for 400 pages.  There isn't a single interesting character in this book, in my opinion.  You just have to slog your way through the book to get to the end.  It's the Bataan Death March of novels.  I hope this is an aberration - I'll certainly give him another try since the first four novels that I read were so good.  But one more stinker like this one and I'll drop his name from my reading list 
 Boy, was this a bunch of trash and waste of money!  It's obvious that Joan  is trying to hang on her little sisters coat tails but she just doesn't  have the writing skills and someone out there who told her "your books  great darlink" should have been a real friend and told her what a  bunch of garbage it is.  And she continues to write which I just don't  understand!  This book is boring.  Don't waste your money!  Buy the  Enquirer instead.  It'll be more entertaining 
 If character means loving the rich and big business, then Bush has character in spades; of course, indifference to the middle class and disdain for the poor are also part of the Bush thing 
 I have mixed feelings about tomatoes.  One time a tomato ate both of my parents. On the other hand, they can be made into apple pies.  In conclusion, I am a tomato 
 Book is complete waste of money. Find more prevalent information online. Not really a required book. Not used at all 
 As an 8th gr teacher we don't want to spend hours teching grammar the old way boring the students.  This book is wonderful because they are interested in the stories. This interest also allows them to truly understand the concept of grammar and punctuation 
 I bought this with the hope of reading an easy-to-approach book containing the current science on baby development.  What I got instead was a book containing a little science and a lot of breathless commentary on how amazing babies, science, and scientists are.  If you're a thinking religious person that believes science is a useful tool that does not have all the answers you probably will not enjoy this book.  The authors have already come to all the conclusions for you and God has been deliberately scrubbed out (literally--they quote part of the famous Wordsworth poem "Intimations of Immortality from Recollections of Early Childhood" at the heading of the last chapter, but leave off the final and most significant line, "From God who is our Home.").  On the other hand, if you belong to the "science is man's best hope" school of thought then you may enjoy this book. 
 One of the greatest video game fighters in history, excluding Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter's popularity eventually produced excitment for a feature film, even starring Jean Claude.  The result, a bomb.  Fortunately, Street Fighter is not even as bad as the 2nd Mortal Kombat movie, but it is still pretty poor.  I have tried really really hard to enjoy this movie, especially since just about all the Street Fighter characters are in the film and stay fairly close to their video game identities, but the ridiculousy dumb humor, crappy acting, and lack of any good-looking action forces the film to suffer.  Jean Claude even looks weak in this film, but compared to the other actors, they still manage to make him look good.  The story is weak too, with a lot of nonsense to kill time in what is already a short movie, not even an hour and half.  The only highlight is the fight between Bison and Guile (Van Damme), where they actually use some moves from the video game such as Bison's elevation ability and Guile's flash kicks.  Unfortunately, editing doesn't make the fight look very real at all.  I only like this movie because I love the video game, and this is the only movie made with these guys, that is not animated.  If you don't enjoy the game, you will most likely hate this movie.  If you love Van Damme, this is one of his weakest entries.  Only obsessed Street Fighter fans will want this film 
 It says it supports Mac all over the package. However it doesn't support,  and cannot be made to support Mac  files that allow a wider use of characters for naming files. For instance, when I drag a folder over this icon to copy it starts copying until it comes to a file that has been named "ilegally" or uses a prohibited character. It says that it cannot copy this file and gives you the prompt "OK"?.  "OK" is your only choice to click on.  By clicking on  "OK" the job terminates and you have a partially copied folder.  How is that for compatibility? How is that for delivering backup assurance? I feel swindled.  The product has a geeky feel to it also with lots of acronyms an geek speak.  Mine will probably become landfill and be written off as an expensive education about doing more research than simply trusting the copy on the box. It's Mac compatible as long as you adopt PC conventions in how you operate your Mac.  Run Mac owners... Ru 
 The phone works but the answering machine doesn't.  It plays the outgoing message but never takes the phone "off-hook".  The calling party can't hear the message or leave a message, the phone appears to keep on ringing.  And I had to pay return shipping costs to boot.  Let's see if the replacement works.. 
 This book is widely known as a classic, but the reader is left wondering "why?" Protagonist (can't call him a hero) of this novel is poor farmer Ethan Frome, who lives a joyless existence with his hypochondriac wife. He finds some "excitement" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting.  To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book. WHY??? 
 Once upon a time I thought Jeff Sachs was both a genius and a tower of integrity....then I read this tragic work.  This book is the result of what happens when a brilliant mind goes "Hollywood". As a Financial Economist who actually lives in Africa...it is obvious to me that Jeff is selectively clueless about how things really work here. Then again...I think Jeff knows exactly what the people he works for at the UN want to hear. 
 I was Soooo looking forward to this DVD and I was very, very disappointed. It is just club dancing with belly dancing costumes. Don't waste your money!  Buy Rachel Brice or Shamira or Fat Chance Bellydance !!! 
 First of all this film is a mockery of the classic cartoon.  Scooby looks nothing like himself and Shaggy is played over the top by Matthew Lillard who looks nothing like Shaggy.  I could get over these points however but the movie was completely boring with no plot, just a showcase for lackluster special effects.  Then about half way through Scrappy Doo who is upset because he didn't get what he wants decides to take revenge and PEES all over the girls.  I could not believe they would put such filth in a movie geared toward families and children.  The people who made this film are really sick in the head and should think about working on more adult oriented films to satisfy their obvious "creative" needs.  I have no problem with adult material but it belongs in an R or NC-17 rated film.  Films like this are the ones giving Hollywood a bad name.  Kids might think its funny when a dog pees on someone but kids also think just about anything is funny.  Like it or not Kids learn alot from movies and TV about acceptable behavior and tend to emulate what they think is funny for attention.  How many children after seeing this film threw a tantrum and then peed on one of their siblings or parents? What a way to ruin a good series with an awful movie and then some dog pee.  
 like many other negative reviews, i've experienced the same problems with this razor.  i guess less blades is more and i'm going back to the m3 power.  i'll be brief about the problems:  1.  there's more "pulling" when you shave.  it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut. 2.  the razor is harder to clean off. 3.  i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn. 4.  it's more expensive than other better razors out there.  so there you have it.  if you HAVE to try it out, hey it might work for you.  but please, keep your receipt (and packaging) in case you want to get a refund.*  *  if you're reading this is 2009, chances are that gillette's money back guarantee will no longer be around.  however, there will probably be a gillette razor with 12 blades by then 
 Set aside the fact that you could take $100 to iTunes and make your own CD set (or mpg file folder) much better than this one.  Set aside, too, the fact that musical culture is just too splintered and disparate anymore to capture in a decade-spanning 7CD set.    I enjoy compilations because they reveal someone else's impression of a musical time frame or genre.  Even on those terms, though, this set is a failure.  You get absolutely no sense, listening to this set, that there's an organizing consciousness behind it.  In fact, this is the first Rhino compilation I know of that doesn't seem to have been assembled by fans of music.  More than anything, this set reminds me of the now popular "Jack" radio format: an expert mix of unexceptional, middlebrow tunes from several genres, all mixed randomly together.    I own the two previous compilations in this line and each has its charm.  The 70s box chronicles the apex of melodic, tuneful pop.  The 80s box drags at times but still manages to capture the over-the-top, self-important buffoonery of that decade.  There's really no fun in the 90s box.    Maybe that's because nothing really comes out of left field anymore; musical culture is far too subsumed by marketing.  Maybe the 90s just weren't that endearing.  (Hey, maybe I'm too old!)  I don't know.  Sad but true:  This is the first musical recording of any sort (and I own thousands) that I listed on Ebay even before it came out of my player.   
 A friend really enjoys this film, and I agreed to watch it in deference to her insistence that I see it. This is a rare sort of role for Robert DeNiro, although he is always full of surprises. It does not quite work, though, to see him as a crazed baseball fanatic of sorts; it is not quite believable somehow. My dislike for Wesley Snipes contributes to my distaste for the film in general. The only truly redeeming thing here is Benicio del Toro. 
 I guess it all depends on what you want from a book about history. For me, a biography of someone who's already had any number of biographies really has to tell us something we didn't already know. This one doesn't. So I guess if you're the sort of person who's never seen another book about Robespierre, you'll find this story, well-told as it is, fascinating. But I could point you to five other books, some very old, that tell the same story just as well. And if some of the reviewers here can come away from it with the impression that Robespierre was "corrupt" in some material sense, then it really isn't making its central point of his "fatal purity" very clearly, is it 
 There are adventures throughout the world.  If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.  Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his "travels."  These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for "the power of the mind" [my words, not his].  Two sections bother me a lot.  One is his search for that "power of the mind"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought.  Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says "great!  No need to search for any explanation."  The travel analogy would be, what?  You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.  Strike one.  As Crichton hangs around with "friends" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but "boys will be boys" [again, my words].  Strike two.  And I'm sorry... State of Fear?  Strike three.  Michael Crichton, you are out 
 I'm sure once you wade through all of his unsupported statistics, you'll find some useful advice from Mr. Lawhon, but I'm completely turned off by his assertions of 75% of this and 25% of that, for which he has no documentation.  If only I still owned the book (I was reimbursed for it by my employer), I would go back through it with a pen and redline all the useless crap.  After reading Book One, I feel discouraged, which is perhaps what the author wanted--to discourage anyone who wasn't wholeheartedly committed to selling.  (I started to write "110% committed," but then I would be guilty of misusing percentages in much the same manner as Mr. Lawhon. 
 The title reads: "Descartes's Secret Notebook". And those who bought this book supposedly wants information about the notebook. And what do we get? Less than 30 pages of facts about the notebook (mostly a summary of a 1987 article by Pierre Costabel) and tons of unrelated, old, and sometimes (often?) misreported facts about Descartes' life.  Wow! I've got myself a new paperweight! Thanks so much Aczel 
 all right... so this movie isn't bad. but it isn't that good either.  the good things are that prescott is actually, well, good in some parts of the movie. also, they didn't call the kid another name like in home alone 3.  the bad things are that lots of the actors didn't do very well in this film and the writing is terrible. The booby traps lasted for only 10 minutes!  so either you don't watch this movie, rent it, or borrow it. don't spend your money on buying it 
 I'm assuming you're reading this because you want to know if this book is worth your money and time, and whether or not you should read it.  If this is not the case, you can skip the rest of this review, and read most of the others - which I have found to be largely testimonial, and will tell you what those reviewers think about the diet.  If you want to know something about the book: read on.  Firstly, I had a very difficult time reading this book - in fact, I skipped most of it, because a very large portion of the book is made up of extended testimonial-like cases.  This made the book feel like marketing - and even if you're not as suspicious of marketing as I am, it wears on your nerves quite quickly if you approach the book wanting to learn something about the diet.  Additionally, Mr. Atkins' tone made it sound like the diet was a religion or a cult.  This made me want to try it even less.  Secondly, Mr. Atkins also seems to be encouraging a sedentary lifestyle.  In the portion of the book that I read, he never once mentioned physical activity of any sort other than eating.  This turned me off, as I believe that one of the major sources of obesity, especially in highly "industrialized" countries, is lack of physical activity.  In short, he does not promote a balanced lifestyle any more than a balanced diet.  Thirdly, Mr. Atkins makes several factual and logical errors.  He mentions our ancient hunter ancestors, but fails to mention that they were also gatherers: fruits, roots, nuts, seeds, honey ... all with lots of carbs.  And people 200 years ago may have consumed much less sugar than we do now, but he doesn't think that perhaps they weren't obese because of their diet, but because of the amount of physical activity demanded of the large majority of the population just to stay alive.  Fourthly and finally, the book gave me no information I could not have found on the internet.  To sum up, is the book worth your time and money?  You be the judge, but for me, it wasn't; I can recommend neither the book nor the diet 
 Those who describe this story as "cute" and Joon as "quirky" aren't paying attention. For me, this movie was a trip through hell with a final destination of insanity. The writers slickly throw just enough whitewash on top to let most people ignore the darkness. Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie 
 I read this book and I think presented material is not practical in commercial applications. In my opinion better solution is writting tests and using aspects to integrate applications. I know this is something different from contracts, by I think contracts are to complex, hard to maintain and lacks of support for multithreaded problems.   For me another problem with contracts is problem in describing complex constraint that exists in problem domain. For example how to describe that objects must be cloned, not passed by reference or how to check that objects holded by readonly list not change their state during operations on list?  Regards, Marci 
 This book is HORRIBLY written.  The book jumps around, as everyone else has said, and is just very poorly written--the characters are flat and boring, the dialog is not believable, etc.  A INFINITELY better book for teens on this subject is "When is Perfect, Perfect Enough?" by Nancy Rue 
 Obviously the movie was bad but the viewer has to admit that it was a new idea for a horror film. A kid walking around with Satan disguised in a Halloween wardrobe. I don't no if this movie is suppose to be serious or funny but I had a couple of laughs 
 This book is organized into chapter topics such as Cosmic inheritances, Being, Knowing, Society, Polity and so on. The value of the book is the extensive quotations he has assembled from Calvin on each of the chapter topics. In that sense, the book functions almost as an index of Calvin's thought, and it's valuable for scholars looking for quotations from Calvin on specific topics.   The title advertises the book as a biography, but it's not. Bouwsma states that the biographical facts of Calvin's life have been covered elsewhere, and he does not plan to revisit that ground. So we have a biography of Calvin which assumes that you have already read his biography elsewhere! Much of what Bouwsma argues doesn't make much sense without knowledge of Calvin's life and time. Dividing Calvin into arbitrary and abstract topic areas fragments his thought unnecessarily, distorting his life and thought.   Bouwsma sets up a strawman to his position, that Calvin's debt to Renaissance humanism has been ignored. This is not true at all. In fact, Calvin's debt to humanism is virtually a truism of Calvin scholarship. Unfortunately, Bouwsma's approach here is typical of post-modern revisionary historical scholarship.   Bouwsma's interpretation of Calvin is deeply problematic for a number of reasons. First of all, he portrays Calvin's thought as essentially a reaction to the uncertain times in which he lived, and to Calvin's own anxieties and fears. Calvin emerges here as depressed, anxious, and neurotic. That's a very one-sided view, and there's just not enough evidence to support that claim. It seems very reductive to interpret Calvin's theology as just an expression of his personal insecurities. What's missing here is any kind of larger historical perspective that can explore and appreciate the constructive dimension to his thought. Calvin is a hugely influential thinker who contributed to the development of modernity, but to read Bouwsma, one might think Calvin was merely an obscure pastor obsessed with his own anxieties 
 this review is about the english version, though relevant to the spanish as well.  we finally remembered to donate it to the salvation army so we would no longer have to read it to our child.  pure sap.  c'mon, the elderly mother drives to her grown son's house, scales a ladder to his room and rocks him back and forth, back and forth...touching?  creepy!  read it at the library before spending the cash 
 FUTUREWORLD is really not a bad follow-up to WESTWORLD, but Goodtimes Home Video makes viewing this film a very bad-time. The only thing good about it is seeing Yul Brynner back if this is the only way we can get to see him. He was very good if only for a short segment in this film. Hard to recommend this version at all 
 For two people so associated w/punk rock music, it seems odd that Victor Bockris and Roberta Bayley could have written such a tepid account of Patti Smith. This book relies heavily on published interviews and sensationalistic accounts of her life that Patti has given to journalists over the years. Bockris and Bayley paint her as controlling in some instances and a pushover in others, often in their attempts to discover her motivations. Not only that, but could they have chosen a more unattractive photo of Patti to adorn the book jacket? Patti had nothing to do w/this book and if you want the real deal, buy her collections of poetry, Early Work and The Coral Sea, and her complete lyric collection, which has tons of photos and some of Patti's journal notes from over the years 
 I wish that Amazon can get it right, that when you create a service you do  not have to go into some's computer and screw around, Shame on you Amazon for allowing this to happen. I guess I will have to purchase an Apple Ipod and go with I tunes. It appears to be a much better product and service 
 I just finished reading Angry Black White Boy.  It seemed like a good premise, but could have been a lot better.  The writing style is so poor, with such tenous logic, that any points that the author makes about racism are weakened.  The characters are two-dimensional and don't behave like real people.  They just serve to move the plot from point A to point B.  So many of the characters are thin stereotypes that the overall message is dilluted.  The main character, named Macon, is the "downest" white guy ever.  He seems to be an embarrassing alter-ego for the author (who has some hip-hop album reviews on his web site if you want a sample his writing style).  Macon is not exactly a hero, but something of an Eminem among black political leaders.  Macon's political message is somewhat ambivalent, and it's easy to lose interest in his character halfway through.  The ending is ridiculous and ruins the story.  Mansbach's overall writing style can be downright embarrassing.  He's overly earnest in his attempt at hipness.  He often uses bad poetry slam writing full of paens to hip-hop, with cringe-inducing use of words like "pimpstrut" as a verb.  The book also includes fictional segments from the memoir of an early negro baseball player, but they're written in a revisionist style that's way out of touch with the writing of that time.  It's another fatal error that prevents the book from ringing true.  I wanted to like this book, and found some of the observations on racial identity to be very acute, but overall it just doesn't work.  A writer like Gore Vidal, for example, can write about controversial subjects like this with absurdity and insight, but Adam Mansbach just doesn't succeed.  For a better book on racism, skip Angry Black White Boy and just read Richard Wright's novel Black Boy instead (or any of the many such books by prominent black authors who actually know what they're talking about, unlike Mr. Mansbach) 
 My daughter got this present for her birthday. She opened it with anticipation. I followed all the directions, adding batteries first,and then turning the unit on prior to the next step. The instructions said to tune the wirelss microphone to 100.1 FM. I did that and there was already a radio station at the same 100.1 FM location. The mic didn't work. In the "fine" print it said, "Mic may not work in REMOTE areas where there is already a radio station at 100.1 FM". HA!!! We live in the #3 largest city in the USA and trust me, it doesn't work in the big city either. A total waste of MONEY. Please don't waste yours on this thing...! 
 I can see how some readers might be put off by all of the science and detail in this book, though I was personally not bothered by it.  There were several things that did trouble me however: 1.) The abrupt switch in the third section from first person to third person.  I felt separated from the characters, especially Claire, and more or less ceased to care about her.  Her behavior on the expedition didn't feel like the person that was established in the first two-thirds of the book, either.  2.) The many parallels between Magda and Claire felt a little contrived.  Her quest to trace her family's history was compelling in and of itself, and didn't need to have those "clairvoyant" elements. 3.) The Ripper subplot was pointless and uninteresting.  For a truly fascinating real theory about the Ripper murders, read Alan Moore's From Hell.   4.) Absolutely no resolution on what happened to Nick and Christian. 5.) The Jack-Claire affair was just creepy. 
 (...)It really sucks, simple as that. That moaning of Scott Stapp, those lyrics of Scott Stapp. Ugh, SCOTT STAPP! It seems that anything he touches turns to crap. Let's not forget Celebrity Poker. By the time this album came out, it was pretty much confirmed that Scott Stapp and his Creed cohorts were nothing more than a sappy music rendering, trying to be sensitive, poop band. "Not so fast..." moans Stapp. Early in the album is the "hit" song "What if". This song showed us that Creed still had some edge to them. The only problem was that the lyrics really didn't enhance this listening experience. I know the song is called "What if"; I don't need the phrase said 64 times. And another thing. The first time I heard Creed, I could have sworn I was listening to Pearl Jam, bad Pearl Jam. Apparently I wasn't the first to make this comparison, and the band knew it. That guitarist, what's his face, I don't know, even had the gall to say the following: "Eddie Vedder wishes he could write a song as good as Scott Stapp." Well, Scott Stapp wishes he could sing in a way so people don't think he's ripping off Eddie Vedder, which he's clearly doing 
 I'll level with you...this is a lame movie with mediocre acting & totally uninteresting characters.  It starts out strong & shows some promise but, just give it another 10 minutes....your thumb will find the eject button. HOWEVER, there is one saving grace....her name is Lacey Chabert!  Trust me, guys (and girls who like other girls), you should really rent this flick just to see the delicious Lacey in rare form!  This adorable morsel (who was age 23 at the time of filming in 2005), absolutely has one of THE Best figures I've ever seen!!  Unfortunately, we don't get to see all of her (which is seriously weak for an unrated film!) but, our girl does juuuust fine.  Skip to chapters 9 & 10, and see if you agree.  ; 
 I'll put my opinion first, so there won't be any doubt in your mind.  I don't believe that you can write useful books about national character.  Is there really such a thing as "national character"? People are  just too different, too unpredictable. How well can you predict the  behavior of the people closest to you ?  How well can you predict what  people in your own country will do ?  Would every Italian, if they could  write well, have written the same book as Mr. Barzini ?  I seriously doubt  it.  So what we have in THE ITALIANS is one man's views on the conglomerate  nature of 50 million Italians.  After reading it, I felt even more strongly  that such books, though possibly entertaining, are a waste of time.  An  informative book about unicorns--but do they exist ?   Anthropologists have  been concerned, for many years, in getting the "inside view"--the  view of a culture as seen by the person within it.  While Barzini is  indisputable Italian, he tries to visualize Italians as seen by foreign  visitors, then explain to those of us not lucky enough to travel there, why  they are as visitors see them, or why they are not as foreigners may think.   This is not a successful gambit.  Cultures are based on many general  factors--like history, socio-economic patterns, religion, family,  etc.---but the specific results are just that, specific.  Barzini covers  many topics--the importance of spectacle and giving an illusion of  something rather than actually having that quality; the family vs. the  state; Italian modes of achieving success; the north-south split; Sicily  and the Mafia; and last, the tragedy of Italy's long domination by  foreigners.  But nothing really connects.  There are only superficial,  scattered impressions, nothing very concrete to grasp.  The reader is left  with a handful of stereotypes.  Barzini is at his best when describing the  lives and modus operandi of particular characters in Italian history.   These sections were well-written and interesting.  But his portrayal of  Italian "character" is fuzzy, contradictory, and ultimately,  unconvincing.  Finally, if you are a lover of lists, you will thrill to  this book, because there is a list on nearly every single page.  Myself, I  got pretty tired of those lists.  If you want to know something useful  about Italy, read another book.  If you just want entertainment, which  might support any stereotypes you have about Italians, then this book could  be for you 
 Arthur Rowe is a graying middle-aged man who visits a parish carnival. He tries the fortune teller and unknowingly mentions a coded question. He is told to guess the weight of the cake raffle as "four pounds eight and a half ounces"! Rowe won this prize, but there was some question about it. Back at his apartment he has a piece of cake. Then a bomb falls and destroys his apartment (war time London). The new tenant went to the hospital. Rowe goes to a Private Inquirer to find out about this new tenant, and why he put a drug in Rowe's tea. Next Rowe goes to track down the fortune teller, and visits the lobbying group called the "Free Mothers". Hilfe takes him to a seance where somebody is stabbed. Rowe makes his escape before the police arrive. [This is followed by pages of reminiscing about Rowe's boyhood. It pads the story, and displays Greene's literary prowess. A film would cut it all out to simplify the story.] Pages tell of life in wartime London under the bombs.  The story continues with an undercover operative fooling Rowe into taking a suitcase to a hotel room. ["No good deed ever goes unpunished."] Johns explains the "Ministry of Fear" as the method of gathering dirt on important people then threatening them with exposure if they don't cooperate. [SOP for the Secret Services.] Could a witness disappear into a private asylum (Book Two)? Rowe manages to escape from the asylum, and goes to the police. His information matches what is known. The police raid the private asylum and find 3 dead men. They cannot find the spool of microfilm with the secret papers. They find the buttons and shoes from Jones, the private inquirer, but nothing else. Its easy to get rid of a body in war time. It all ends well: the secret microfilm is recovered, and Arthur is happy.  What could Green have been thinking? The drama about a secret spy ring is masked by the psychological musings of Arthur. The much better "The Third Man" is an improved version of this story, all the dull parts were omitted. Was this written for domestic propaganda? Greene worked for British Intelligence during the war, he could have written a better story. 
 My fiance was a best man in a wedding recently and had never given a speech before. So I bought this book and another one. Boy am I glad that I bought the other book, because this one was no help at all. It only gives you examples of specific toasts and speeches for specific families. It doesn't help. It's not generic enough for someone to put together their own speech from it. It doesn't tell you how to write a speech or do's and don'ts about writing toasts. I would not recommend this book to anyone. If you want a good book for this, buy The Best Man's Handbook. It has way more useful information on speeches and toasts than most speech books 
 I have to preface this by saying that I absolutely love eating at the candle. So delicious. before we moved from NYC, I thought we HAVE to get this book. We've tried several of the recipies, following them to the letter, and have been really dissapointed everytime - with the exception of the  hummus.  I think that they must be leaving out some key ingredients in a lot of these recipies, because all of the ones we have attempted have been either completely flavorless, or tasted like salt. Don't even bother with the soups unless you are a gourmet cook and can figure out how to punch them up somehow after following these directions, because they all end up runny and bland. so sad 
 I am a prolific reader of historical novels, so when I saw "Antiquity" by Norman Cantor, I was intrigued.  Inside the covers, however, lies one of the worst researched, terribly opinionated, and worse, outright disingenuous books purporting to be historical analysis I have ever read.  One could chalk this up to a novice's first attempt, but Cantor is a well known author with his work on Medieval life.  Perhaps, under a rush of a deadline he forgot that history is supposed to be told truthfully.  He skewers or ignores facts, presents blantantly opinionated views which leave a novice reader with a wholly untruthful view of what happened, and provides no documentation of research for his outlandish postulations (presented as fact) of actions, locales or politics which he covers.  My greatest concern, is that there are what apperared to me to be several anti-Semetic references or characterizations, several disparaging remarks of middle-eastern cultures, and an haughty presentation of the Macedonian Empire's world view. Has Cantor lectured so long that he thinks the whole world are easily intimidated as his 18-22 year old audiences?    If you are wanting to know about ancient history, this book isn't for you.  If truthfulness doesn't matter, well then, you might enjoy what really is a self-aggrandizing doorstop 
 We were forced to read this book in philosophy class some years back and everyone was appauled by her hatred of men and  inability of see the beauty and wonder of intercourse.Her view of women isn't much better in that they are supposedly the poor helpless vessels men prey upon to oh my have such a  distasteful act as intercourse.The male in her book is the  aggressor and the female is the passive unwilling but willing  victim to only get children and love in return.If she can't see the pleasure of the sex act then it's no one's fault but hers. Every page of the book was hard to read.I don't know why some people bother to read such books because it's a waste of  trees,paper and time! Another problem is she makes it sound as though women who  like intercourse aren't up to her intellectual level,as though she has some perfect world where women hate men and intercourse. She tries to make very subjective material sound like it's  supposed to be the objective norm for every woman.Not!!! Very dangerous book 
 If you are looking for practical, hard hitting insight and knowledge you can use as a practising manager, totally BYPASS this wordy, ivory tower compendium of theoretical jargon 
 Pity the student using this textbook for a Differential Equations course. The Boyce & DiPrima text is unduly cumbersome with lacking explanation and poorly choosen examples throughout.   Many problems given in the text are tedious, and are indicated as being "technologically intensive." This is fine: in today's workplace, one can anticipate using a computer to solve problems. Unfortunately, none of my math professors will let me bring out my laptop on an exam. In some of the chapters, almost every problem is indicated as being "technologically intensive." If the computer-oriented problems weren't bad enough, the examples in the text are. Most of these are sorely unclear. I think that Boyce & DiPrima must have been writing in Fermat's marginal notes style when composing this text. Many times the omitted steps (which the authors sometimes regard as "it is clear that") require substantial algebraic and calculus manipulation to achieve the indicated results. Certainly I have no qualms about a text leaving out algebraic or even trigonometric simplifications, but what's left out of the Boyce & DiPrima examples is truely excessive. Worse, still, the examples are often very generic to a single type of problem. Thus, while one type of problem in the exercises might have good examples to instruct students on how to achieve solutions, the rest of the exercises often lack example altogether. Explanation and orientation to applied math is poor. The authors jump suddenly from a confusing theory discourse to an application without bridging the two. Many times I was left puzzled by how the text was proceeding. Still many more times I set the book aside in frustration.  This book does, however, have redeeming values. I like how all of the problems have their solutions provided in the back. If only other math textbook authors took the hint: students won't know how well they're doing if they cannot confirm their results! Also, the included software is good. I found it easy to use and helpful for the computing problems. I wish, however, more attention was given to this software in the text (like small projects using the software with each chapter). These benefits unfortunately do not overcome the tremendous flaws with the Boyce & DiPrima text.  Overall, this is one of the worst math books I have encountered. Rife with poor explanation, a confusing style, and poor exercise sets, the Boyce and DiPrima textbook is bound to cause grief for most students. The student's solution manual is helpful, but offers only little more explanation than the textbook. If you are hapless enough to have this text as a course requirement, I recommend that you either swap classes to try and get a course with a different book - or - be prepared to spend many long hours with tutors or your professor.  Good luck.  [... 
 Oh my goodness me where do I start? This book is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The writing level is comperable to that of a 7th grader. The story is very poorly told as well. The writer tries to make herself sound talented by using similies and metaphors at the most awful points in the story. The story could've been interesting if I was written nicely, and was more in depth of events. This book gets too much publicity than it's worth, and this is probobly only because of the subject matter. The book starts off with Lalu, poor Chinese immigrant who was sold multiple times in China, and was starving. Once she came to America she was fed plenty of food, but unfortunetly, she was a sex slave for an evil Chinese Saloon owner. This is where the story gets uninteresting and stupid. She's then sold off the Charlie, a good friend of the man who brought her to the town she resides in. Then it just tells us what happens to her life after all of this. Maybe I didn't like this book because of the subject (Immigrant books never really were my favorite), but the poor writing style sealed the deal for me. Your money is better spent on something else 
 I never received this product and the order tracker never displayed the 'problem with this order?' icon. They stole my $20.00 and now have the nerve to ask me about the product. Its bad enough I am stuck in Iraq, now I have my money stolen. They are thieves. Even if I had to return it, I still may have received a refund. Do not buy from this seller, I could never report it and now I am out 20$. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS SELLER 
 This compass fails to do the one simple task I purchased it for, which is simply telling me which direction I am going.   I spent $[...] for a [...] compass made out of crap materials. It works only for the direction you set it at. For example if you set it while facing north, it will be correct when you go north- but if you change directions, the result is completely random....  This compass only works for one direction- and therefore it is utterly useless for a car situation where you actually (gasp) might turn.  absolute rippoff. 
 The item in this picture is not the item I received.  When you buy from a picture, make sure you are prepared to be disappointed.  The frame of the stand is very thin, not wide as shown, screws are seen that attach to the stand, the bottom of the bowl is seen also.  The bowl has concrete as filler, with a complete circle of bowl, looks cheap.  The colors are washed out, the bird and flower also, not vibrant as shown.  This item came with nothing from Mfg., no instuctions on anything or who they are.  It was well wrapped and the package was ruined in removing. Apparently this was planned.  I was told I could send it back free of charge.  What am I going to send it in?  Good old Amazon offered me 20% off to keep it, this is apparently their standard screw-up fee {not my first experience}.  The item I received is not an $80 item, or a $64 item, it is in my yard, it will remind me where not to buy things in the future.  BEWARE!!!! 
 Fiona Mountain had a good idea for a mystery with Bloodline, but she ruined it with her ham-fisted way of telling a story.  She seems never to have heard that the cardinal rule of good writing is "Show, don't tell", but repeatedly hits the reader over the head with the points she wants to make.  She insists on calling attention to the parallels between Natasha's life and the mystery she's investigating, as if she (the author) were afraid a reader wouldn't be clever enough to notice them on her own.  For example, in describing a scene that takes place in a garden, she says, "The exposed and tangled roots of the weeds were pale through the covering of dark soil", and then feels compelled to add, "The analogy of roots being ripped up wasn't lost on her."  Trust me, if you make it to page 262 (where this passage appears), the analogy wouldn't be lost on you either, even without the authorial intervention.      In my review of Mountain's previous book (Pale as the Dead), I commended her for not letting her research get in the way.  Unfortunately, that isn't the case with this book.  Too often, reading it felt like reading the author's research notes.  She even has one character -- an elderly woman who isn't an academic -- say that, in a conversation which took place many years ago, another character "quoted J. Hooper Harvey's Heritage of Britain".  I find it hard to believe that the character would have remembered not only the title of the book, but also the author's full name, right down to the "J. Hooper".  Sounds to me more like the author, fresh from the library, speaking.   The Natasha Blake mysteries are a bit like Sarah Stewart Taylor's Sweeney St. George mysteries (O' Artful Death, etc.), in that both series are about a young woman with an unusual job that causes her to get involved in solving mysteries from a different angle.   If that concept sounds intriguing to you, I would recommend that you spend some time with Sweeney St. George.  After reading Bloodline, I can't say the same for Natasha Blake.  
 In a world desperate for health solutions, the uneducated masses flock to purported cures and aids that have  not met the tests of either scientific or medical validity.  Alkaline water is one of those potholes that the unsuspecting customer encounters.  Careful research of this book and related topics finds that the real reason alkaline water is popular is that in pregnant Oriental women, it is believed that the use of alkaline water increases the probablility of a boy rather than a girl being born.  Hence the seven(7) percent utilization of this water in that part of the world.    Elsewhere, mycocardia problems with controlled animal tests using alkaline water have been known since 1996 but are suspiciously avoided by the Japanese organizations which promote alkaline water.  Common sense nutrition tells us that if one is concerned about acidic food intake, then the use of alkaline foods with alkaline fibre and neutral pH liquid is the answer.    Alkaline promoters would have you dilute your sensitive blood pH with  high alkalinity thus inducing hematological problems which may put  you in the emergency room as my medic(1985 Nobel Prize recipient) clearly points out.  You might as well drink battery acid he said, the result will be the same stress on your blood pH.  Here is a medic who is not an expert in water but in internal medicine cautioning against forced dilution of blood pH.  He continued by saying that when that much alkalinity is added to the digestive system, the very low pH which naturally occurs in the disgestive tract is neutralized and food is not metabolized properly.  The various amino acids which are essential in the metabolic process are no longer effective and food putrifies and nutrition suffers.  The alkaline promoters, including this book's author have been sniffing glue in a closed closet and are simply out of touch with  even the very basics of body chemistry and metabolic processes.  Read the book for entertainment and not for education and utility in your daily nutritional program 
 Before you pick up this "novel", please read a biography of Jerzy Kosinski's life by author James Park Sloan --Jerzy Kosinski: A Biography. In 1982, Kosinski was completely discredited by the Village Voice for fabricating his auto-biographical, The Painted Bird, and for plagarism found in his most of his other books. He slandered an entire nation (Poland) in The Painted Bird even though he was actually saved by Polish Catholics and lived in safety during the duration of the war. Instead of writing what was a true war experience he decided that shock and brutality would give him more notariety. He became rich and won countless awards and accolades for his damaging lies.  Before he committed suicide in 1991 he tried to make amends for the damage he caused to the Poles but it was too late. The Painted Bird has been deemed a "truth" and has been included on the reading lists of many Holocaust Study Courses.  I feel sorry for the Poles -- that this work produced by a sick, deviant and demented pathalogical liar could be taken as a true experience --it's like spitting on the graves of all those, Jews and Poles alike,that died in the hands of the Nazis during WWII.  It is a terrible injustice 
 As a person who works closely with teens and also reads a lot about teen sexuality and teens in general, I found this book to be too simplistic and very very basic. It reads as though the author is still writing one of her teen advice columns when her audience is primarily adults. The tone of this book very condescending. Weill constantly repeats her qualifications to write this book ("teens trust me," "I have spoken to 1000s of teens in my career"); while those qualifications are good, the constant mentioning of them gets old and can be insulting to the reader.  The statstics sprinkled throughout the book were interesting and I wish more of the text was spent talking about their implications. What does it mean that X percent of 13 year olds have had sex? Have had 4 or more partners? The text was quite separated from the survey results and was too simplistic and not very insightful. I understand that this book was supposed to be accessible, but I found it so basic that it offered very little that was new or even interesting.   Her quotes from teens were also suspect to me. If she got responses from 1000s of teens about their sex lives and beliefs, why these quotes? They seem to come from the same mold and offer little diversity. Basically, they all say that a person should wait for sex or talk about negative experiences with sex. Where are the stories of teens who have healthy sexual experiences? I am not necessarily advocating teen sex, but I do believe that people should be exposed to the idea that some teens do like to have sex and have it responsibly.   If you have never read anything about teen sex before, this might be useful. If you have, it's simply a sensationalized summary in a condescending tone.  
 The review title says it all.... 
 I called Dr. Rosen the president of Tend skin and asked him about his product.  First off, he is not a nice person on the phone and was very abrupt with an interested consumer.  I asked him about how much PURE ALCOHOL was in Tend Skin and he literally BLEW UP ON ME!  Hey-I was just wondering if it was the amount of PURE ALCOHOL that caused my skin to CATCH ON FIRE.  I guess so because he caught on fire:)  
 THIS MOVIE WAS OBVIOUSLY MADE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN, AND OLDER PEOPLE WILL NOYT UNDERSTAND IT 
 I do not understand why certain critics who are acquaintances of Mr. Lambert's have described this as an affectionate book about actress Natalie Wood. It is not a sympathetic portrait of Miss Wood' in fact, Mr. Lambert blames her for the tragic events in her life when she's not alive to defend herself. He also goes out of his way to attack her mother and her sister in what seems to be a personal vendetta while at the same time falsely glorifying rv actor Robert Wagner, who he admits is a long time friend of his. There would be no need to remember Miss Wood in a book at this time had she not drowned under suspicious circumstances that Mr. Wagner obviously wishes to conceal. It is clear that Mr. Lambert's true loyalty is to Robert Wagner, not to Natalie Wood 
 The John Carter of Mars series of books, by my favorite author of all time,   Edgar Rice Burroughs,  is his best series. I was so excited to receive the audio version of this book, but when I listened to it, I was hoorified !    John Carter sounded like a wimp.  A girly Southerner, not at all the swashbuckling hero I envisioned.   Now, maybe I'm spoiled by the narrators of other books, but even the weakest, most boring readings have not turned me off in the way that John Bolen has.   Please Tantor audio,  get some one else to read this, and make sure it is a Manly-Man ! 
 Well this was my third book by Mr. Eco and dthe continue to get worse. The Rose was excellent and made me hungry for more but after the Pendulum and this Hyper-Realty bit I'm going to have to call it quits. The author has the ability t oput together a great novel such as the Rose, I wish it were mine, but the other stuff is just not happening 
 God has already written a book. It is called the Holy Bible. Which god wrote this book? Mr. Walsch should not be so deceitful.  
 You don't need to trust me--you can look inside the book and get a load of the first translation of the "Frog King" which is unreadable.  Someone just took an old translation and reprinted it on poor quality paper.  This does not do justice to the tales 
 I could present this book with a serous analysis, but even the fair and balance New York Times ignores O'Reilly books in their review section.  Bill being this untimate pitchman should check the demographics for his show.  It would demonstrate that the average age for the No Spin Show is over seventy years old.  Which is why is his ratings are declining this past year, his viewer are dying of natural cause.  I suggest his next book be titled "The O'Reilly Factor For Nursing Home Residents". 
 Nope, it is not funny. Some people might not consider me qualified to review this, as I did not even finish watching it, but personally, I was highly offended. Madea is nothing more than violent and abusive. End of story. Once she got out the belt and started beating her foster child, I had to turn it off, as I was highly disturbed. Who promotes this as being funny? That is a sad situation which unfortunately happens to lots of kids, and as a teacher and former camp counselor, I have unfortunately had direct contact with many children who have been abused in a similar way. I am sure anyone who has had direct experience with victims of abuse would agree with me that it is never funny to promote any form of domestic abuse. And all the other scenes were extremely boring. Do not watch this movie, unless you think abuse is funny, and then you are just sick 
 You read the reviews and you think you are getting a scholarly study of the history of the Templars ... boy are you going to be surprised!!  What you get is a slim book with one or two sentences concisely summing up the history of a given year and then it starts to confuse fact and fiction by discussing Holy Blood, Holy Grail, the DaVinci Code and conspiracy theories.  This book is not worth a single penny ... it is the worst purchase I have ever made and thank heavens the author has a real job because it is obvious he is neither a writer nor a historian!! 
 I first encountered "Sr. Issues" by way of "Wisdom Distilled from the Daily," a fine read on St. Benedict if you could get past the occasional barbs against the church vis a vie "womans roles." With this latest work, Sr. Issues revisits and expands on this and other topics.  In short, Traditional Catholics would be well served to ignore Sr. Joan, there are so many fine Catholic authors ones' money and time is too precious to waste on a schismatic. For those who seek "reform" in the name of destroying the true faith, "Kerry" Catholics, or quasi-Episcopalians, then Sr. Joan is right up your alley 
 Not very good for a house with impatient people. It was a little sticky at first, by the time I contacted seller, they broke it. 
 I had never eaten a Luna bar before I made this purchase, so I had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled.   When I read "chocolate Pecan Pie" .. I expected just that.. the taste of rich chocolate, with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base.  What I received was a bar with little taste, nothing at all similar to the name on the bar.   In my opinion, the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it... the flavor is barely there. The bar is dry. It is never again be on my "purchase" list   
 Dertouzos churns out the usual 'information wil change the future' vision that dominates books of this nature. Unfortunately, nothing here is really new, nor does Dertouzos write with much passion nor pizazz - his pronouncements come across as somewhat pretentious and trite. I prefer Esther Dyson's Release 2.0, which hawks much the same vision but in a nicely homey, conversational style that reveals how personal her book is compared to this one 
 From the folks who brought you the truth about the "liberal media" comes an uncredentialed academic's rant about the "liberal" turn sociology allegedly took in "the sixties." First of all, she would do well to read Thomas Frank's "The Conquest of Cool" about the rather lucrative conservative myth about "the Sixties." Secondly, it's hilarious to see a right-wing conservative who must have gone to graduate school still grasping to portray objectivity while hiding behind "academic" language to criticize behaviors she deems immoral--the hilarious collapse of pedophilia and homosexuality, for example, which seems not to notice there is a difference between consensual and non-consensual behavior, is a case in point. There seems not to be much difference in the intellectual nuance exhibited by a conservative rep like Santorum and a right-wing academic, no wonder she ended up at UC-SD. All in all, this book is the kind of politicized, conservative trash that ends up at a publisher like Encounter, all she needs to do now is to water down the language and take it to Regnery. Maybe then at least it'll sell something 
 An important note on what is graphic in this novel and what is not: obviously, the account of Runyon setting himself on fire on pages 16-17 is harrowing and disturbing, but not really graphic or gory.  There are several references to erections, some using slang, some not. I think those were relatively tame and mature.   What is graphic and disturbing is the account of Runyon and his father brutal killing of a wild possum for no reason whatsoever.  As an English language arts teacher, I have read a lot of press about this book. Looking back, I wonder if people who reviewed this book actually read it. Why? While it is very easy to sympathize with the author, this is a memoir that falls flat of any expectations, even the lowest.  Having written that, it should be noted here that one of my eighth grade students really liked this book.  Brent Runyon is an eighth grader when we he soaks his bathrobe with gasoline, climbs into the bath tub, and strikes the match that will leave 85% of his body covered in burns.  Thankfully, Brent manages to turn the shower on and douse the flames. Then he summons his older brother Craig who calls 911 and saves Brent's life.  His subsequent recovery comprises the entirety of the narrative.  Unfortunately, this story is excruciatingly flat and extremely superficial.  Runyon recounts his recovery in hospitals and rehabs by recounting endless inconsequential details about his surroundings and caregivers.  This in itself is not bad.  In fact, I expected it as diversion from dealing with the root problem that lead to his suicide attempt, depression.  However, as the narrative progresses, so do these details.  Not until a very short epilogue does Runyon address the issue of depression and only in a superficial manner.    As I read this book, I kept waiting for insight into something, anything, in fact.  But Runyon avoids issues like teenage suicide, self-esteem, disfigurement, and regretfully, depression.  Nobody in the story is redeemed.  No one transcends anything.  The experience of attempting suicide isn't used to gain insight or help other people prevent suicide or treat depression.  Runyon's character develops into a spoiled brat, enjoying the attention of everyone but resisting the attempts to help him unless attractive female nurses provide it. By the last third of the book, I was very bored with Runyon's pity party, but read faithfully until the end anyway.  I began the book rooting for the memoirist but by the end, I found him to be an unsympathetic character.  Now that fifteen years have passed since he attempted suicide, I hope Runyon and his publishers will consider another edition of this book.  In it, they can probe more deeply into what has the potential to be a compelling and redemptive story 
 I bought this for my son, who was just over 2 years old at the time.  Within about 9 or 10 months, the railing broke at the plastic hinge.  Obviously, since this is major stress point for the product, it cannot be fixed with just some heavy duty glue.  I was disappointed that this railing did not last longer 
 The unabridged edition has 25 CDs. To abridge down to four is ridiculous. The story jumps around so much that it is very hard to follow and keep the characters straight. I was left wondering what the story was about, having just heard the highlights, like reading Cliff notes instead of the book. I subsequently ordered the unabridged edition 
 Tonight I saw Mr. Chopra on television.  I was stunned at seeing a man who hardly looked healthy never mind younger or ageless!!!  Common folks, put two and two together.  Why can't he produce the effects he promises and makes you pay for such empty promises.  My Dr. friend was correct about Chopra finding a way to milk folks for tons of money!  The shocking part was the man who carries an air of such lofty spirituality displayed little spirituality on the TV.  He was not only bloated looking but so was his attitude, full of criticism for Western thought, Christianity, America's foreign policy etc.  I am not saying we are perfect or there isn't room for criticism but he was full of criticism with nothing good to say about what is worth acknowleging at the Western culture.  He had to set himself up as the one voice of enlightenment....it sells more books, healing appts, lecturers, etc.   I copied a portion of what another reviewer wrote because it shows the level of superiority in attitude and the traversty of such actions upon real dialouge, the kind of arrogance that came across by Chopra on tv tonight. Before finishing want to say,  It's ok to want to make a fortune only don't wear false spirituality to do so. In the early 70's I went to the Marharishi (?) Meditation Center in NY where they charged $200 for the mantra, the same mantra they undoubtedly recycled a billizion times, asking the initiate not to share the secret mantra!  I was so young and naive.  Then there was Baghwan (?) with the fleet of Roll Royces and a hefty bank acct. He had followers hand over the deeds to their homes for the price of enlightenment, of course they did so willing based on what they were made to believe! That guy feed into the human desire of some, to let go and feel it was ok to do whatever they want...endless sex, drugs etc...no judgment. All this done in the name of being more spiritual, enlightened than the rest of us! Chicanery comes in many forms, only in searching for the NEW often people ignore the obvious deception that is right in front of them. End  "Having worked with a large number of cancer patients through the years, following their fears and struggles, it seems like an insult to ordinary humble workers to say "Reprogram your quantum mind and get rid of the cancer". If Chopra could show one case of a person who could do this, including himself, I`d be willing to change my view of this as a condescending way to treat suffering humans who need compassion and good palliative care, not easy solutions that give the responsibility to the patient, whereas the doctor stands with no soil of the human factor on his hands. This is a travesty of the Hippocratic ideal, and will strengthen the view of alternative doctors as superficial, money-loving peddlers of false hopes. 1 star rating is inevitable, I hate to say. Luckily, there are many good sources of the same knowledge that Chopra embezzles. (Hope I haven`t been too harsh, I have no wish to attack Chopra, but I wish to strengthen a more substantial approach to the issues of aging, health and dying). 
 I am very dissapointed at this book. It seems like this is a 4 year old book. But don't worry i am going to order more Baby Sitters Club this time with mysteries! I am really sad at this book= 
 What a disaster!  This movie is a complete waste of time from start to finish.  The animation is ugly, horrible, and unrealistic and the three stories are bland and boring.  What was Disney thinking?  Oh, I know!  "Let's see if we can eek a little more cash out of Cinderella.  Who cares if we destroy a beloved classic?"  Several main characters are completely different from the original movie and it makes no sense.  In the first story, the King has turned from a happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into a stuffy, sour old curmudgeon.  Suddenly there's a rule about no commoners in the palace?  Uh...isn't there a line in the original about "every eligible maiden in the kingdom?"  The palace was FULL of commoners that night.  The story picks up as the Prince and Cinderella return from their honeymoon, so in the space of a few weeks, the King has completely changed.  I guess they weren't creative enough to come up with anything that would stay true to the characters.  The other two stories are equally nauseating and are not worth my time to review or your time to read.  Avoid this mess of a movie.  The really sad thing is that "ugly, horrible, unrealistic animation and bland and boring stories" pretty much describes any Disney sequel or direct-to-video slop on the market 
 After much experimentation on thousands of world-class athletes, the Active Isolated Stretching methods that the Wharton's have popularized is more effective and less time confusing. In addition, it requires no one  else. Someday, studies will show that static and passive stretching leave  an active muscle group stale. Dynamic range of motion will be better  understood.PNF will no longer be viable 
 I was very disappointed in this book. My little one asked me why were there not any dark girls in it? I told her I did not know why. But being an a dark skinned black woman, I know why. Yes, you better believe small children take note of this disparity in our race 
 David Thomson is the sort of smug, pretentious critic you always wanted to smack around. Even the author's photograph on the book jacket oozes self-importance and ersatz sophistication - the only things missing from the picture are a smoking jacket and pipe. Basically, he is nothing but an unctuous salesman, but what he's selling isn't film, it's his own intellectual pedigree. In other words, reading this book you learn more about David Thomson than you do about the movies, and the picture isn't very pretty.  Thomson certainly has a large vocabulary at his disposal, but for all his flowery language he isn't a very good writer. The descriptive phrases he uses make frequent stabs at poetry but often wind up sounding overblown and empty, like so much hot air. He also has a talent for contradicting himself(frequently within a single sentence). For instance, he snobbishly decries "sentimentality" in movies every chance he gets, yet champions the work of P.T. Anderson, in my mind one of the most sentimental filmmakers working today.   But his worst offense is dismissing the talents of some of the true giants of cinema, particularly Federico Fellini, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick and Martin Scorsese. I'm not opposed to a critic skewering a few sacred cows, I don't think any artist, even Mozart or Shakespeare, is above criticism, but Thomson's critiques lack heft, in fact they are downright hypocritical. For example, he castigates Kubrick and Scorsese for knowing more about cinema than they do about life, yet anyone who has amassed the knowledge and opinions necessary to write a tome such as this one cannot have done very much with his own life other than watching and studying movies. In effect, Thomson comes across as the worst sort of critic - an obsessive, self-loathing nerd who tries to pass himself off as "experienced." The same thing he accuses Kubrick and Scorsese of being. He really is a literary version of the kind of filmmaker he chastises, someone who uses broad sweeping gestures(in his case, big words and affected wisdom instead of trippy lighting and baroque camera angles) to cover up a profound lack of depth.  Instead of the high-minded film theorist he believes himself to be, when all is said and done, Thomson is just another pseudo-intellectual who has spent far too many hours in a darkened room. It isn't his lack of respect for certain artists that eventually dooms him - it is the surfeit of respect and dripping affection he applies to himself 
 I bought this for $5 and while it did an ok job at picking up little things, it did after only a handful of uses. I was considering sending it back to get a new one, but the Euro-Pro warranty requires you to send them $8.95 to cover shipping. That's more than I paid, and frankly, more than I think it's worth. The Mini Turbo Shark is now sleeping with the fishes 
 2 and a half stars.  This is not an accurate representation of Bay Area Hip-Hop. It's a mediocre attempt in trying to appeal to the mainstream audience. Bay Area artists that signed major deals never made an album that was creatively better than their independent releases. Don't waste your time with this record and buy his last album "I Give You My Word".  Highlights of "The Rock"- Frisco Stand Up, Planet Fillmoe, So Young, Way More Than They Can See, Pimps & Hustlas 
 When I reviewed Franken's "Why Not Me?" I explained that I had read it because I loved "Rush Limbaugh is a Big..." but "Why Not Me?" had fallen short of my high expectations.  THIS book was even MORE disappointing.  The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny.  Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- "Lies..." of course).  It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something.  Otherwise, pick something else by Franken.  ANYTHING else by Franken 
 This book claims to present a paradigm for implementing games that learn.  In reality it's a book about a very specific implementation of a very  specific game. The "paradigm" is limited to a few very general  observations that you could have made yourself. 95% or so of this book is  code, and this reviewer was less than impressed with the quality. Clearly,  the code in this book was developed as a hobby project by a couple of  non-professionals who decided to make it into a book. They also decided to  ignore the vast body of existing work on artificial intelligence and make  simplistic claims based on their own experience about what is and isn't  feasible in a computer program. You should be able to find better books on  this subject than this one 
 I consider myself fairly open when it comes to unique, or even delayed plot structure, except here. I must admit, the best parts of this movie were in the trailer. This movie made no sense, and the only possible reference to Babel was that you could understand no one. I fast forwarded through 1/2 of the 2.5 hour movie, and didn't miss a thing. If you must watch it, rent it and don't think it's worth keeping for an extra day based on the trailer, it won't be 
 This book was nothing short of journalistic propaganda. Indeed, Goebbels himself would be proud of Mr. Krakauer with this little number "Under the Banner of Heaven". To read through this was like suffering Chinese Water Torture. There are many gross misrepresentations that Mr. Krakauer puts into this biased and unscrupulous piece of propaganda and an equally greater number of flawed conclusions based on things taken grossly out of context. But before I go into those, I should mention that Mr. Krakauer is a self defined atheist who has had struggles in believing in God. And I should mention that, in case the reader did not already know, Mr. Krakauer himself admitted that he had an agenda in writing this. That is, to prove that the LDS church and it's founder Joseph Smith are sex crazed zealots who have murdered many people in the name of God. Now, lets see how Mr. Krakauer - to no surprise - fails to prove or even indicate this. 1) In this book, Mr. Krakauer claims that the LDS church has always been violent because of the activities of the Danites and because of the Mountain Meadows Massacre. Well show me, Mr. Krakauer, a religion that has not had it's share of fundamentalists that have acted inhumanly in the name of God. Or, better yet, show me how science has never been used to justify the discrimination and murder of people. Have you ever heard of "Dr. Death" or Josef Mengele, who used science to justify his cruel human experiments on of Jews in Auschwitz? Have you heard of Hitler's euthanasia program, which killed thousands of mentally handicapped persons? Have you ever heard of the racial science used in the late 1890's and early 1900's to justify scientific racism? Thought so. Mr. Krakauer, you are throwing the baby out with the bath water. Just because a few men used their religion to justify their personal displacement and murder of others does not mean that the religion that they adhere to is evil. It simply means that those individuals misused and skewed an inherently good faith for evil purposes. 2) You seem to be obsessed with damning Joseph Smith as a sex animal because he had multiple wives. This is very childish, and I would advise you to take a look at yourself in the mirror. Because only those with sex constantly on their own mind would do what you - and several others - are doing and accusing Joseph Smith of doing. Mormon plural marriage was not "just for sex". It was not because Joseph Smith "...remained perpetually and hopelessly smitten by the comeliest female members of the flock..." as you so deviously said. Plural marriage was a very personal matter that created many loving relationships and family bonds. You sir, are no better than the common slanderer who needs to throw a few slugs at a man who you are obviously intimidated by. Countless scholars and historians have all agreed that plural marriage was a religious and social concern, and not "just for sex". 3) While we are on Joseph Smith, do you realize that the brand of magic he did indeed practice as a youth was called "folk magic" or "white magic"? It was not the satanic black magic that you claim Joseph Smith so passionately practiced. The folk magic that he practiced is no different than if today he were to have a rabbits-foot or a ying-yang medallion. It was the popular brand of folk tradition, that even respected ministers and pastors were reported to have practiced. 4) Where you fail as a journalist, you fall flat as an historian. Better get your facts straight and make sure what you are talking about if you are going to write a "history" of a "violent faith". For example, there are four books of scripture, not three, that LDS church members consider cannon. And I hardly consider the Dogberry Papers a reliable source to quote from, which you seem to have no problem doing. In short, this book was nothing more than a piece of journalistic propaganda that would be welcomed with open arms in Nazi Germany. It is lopsided, skewed, biased, bigoted and severely flawed. And our atheist writer is in the same camp as those who think that all Germans are Nazis, all Russians are Communists, all Japanese are buck-toothed fanatics, all Arabs are terrorists and all Catholic Priests are child molesters. Go back to writing about nature, Mr. Krakauer, because history is far more complicated and does not need idiots such as yourself to muck it up more than it already has been.   P.s. I hated "Into Thin Air" as well.    
 Bad writing. Really Awful Paper quality. No photos, cheap illustrations. A 99 cent book that found good fortune because it was there at the right time. I feel truly ripped off 
 I have purchased these beloved sport pants for years. The cut of these pants has been changed with this order. The quality of the cut and fabric is much lower now. I returned the item 
 The violent themes in this book are a bit rough for the 3-4 year olds.  When looking for early readers, I would try to make it age appropriate and not trying to keep true to the greek mythology 
 Bought because it's purportedly a 'MUST READ' of recommended English 19th century literature and I'm trying to read every good book I can before I die (hopefully at 90). Unfortunately,  this book is a waste of time as it's BoRiNg (even w/ the footnotes that I so dearly love).  
 I was expecting simple daily meal plans and it was a lot of reading and recipes that are not always food items on hand.  I was really disappointed in the book 
 What do we do When first started watching wrestling in my early teens, Ric Flair was a hero of mine, he matches were funny and he cut the best promos ever.   So when this DVD came out I got it immediately, hoping to relive my youth, but I realized something. All the matches are the same, there long and dull, the same moves are done over and over, and the matches only pick up when Flair opponent takes the advantage. There is nothing wrong with long matches, if that are done well, like the Iron man match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels, but it feels like these matches are long of the sake of being long, so it can show Flairs endurance.   I also noticed Flair is so repetitive, all wrestler use trademark moves, but flair has been using the same handful of moves his entire life, for example, chop...woo...flair flop...figure four...cheat....win, that not a description of one flair match, that's every flair match. When I started watching wrestling I only saw his WWF matches, so it all looked new to me, when you watch his matches back to back you realise how boring they are. Other wrestler have put together DVD, which shows a variety of different matches such as Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benito, Bret Hart & Shawn Michaels, all top wrestler adopt to there opponents, Flair expects his opponents to adopt to him, that's way all his matches are the same.   The only thing worst then his DVD is his book, I lost all respect for Flair after a read his book, it seem that he is just like HHH and Shawn Michaels in that he does not have the balls to say anything to anyone to their face, put does it behind their backs. He bashes Mick Foley for being a stunt man, who only does gimmick matches, so what's HHH, a guy flair calls great, can anyone name a good HHH match that isn't a gimmick match (WM X-7 against the undertaker does not count because it turns into a street fight). He says Foley kisses the writers asses when everybody knows that he is the ultimate back stage player, who used booking rights to award himself 16 world titles. He critises Bret Hart for not putting over Shawn Michaels at Survivors Series 97, when he was called upon to job to Lex Luger before he left who the WWF. he refused and took the title with him to WWF, brining the WCW to its knees.   After watching this DVD, reading his book, and seeing how his using backstage politics at the WWE now, to keep himself in the limelight, its fair to say the Ric Flair is one of the most overrated wrestler in history and by the way I could have won 16 world title if I had my friends booking the show . 
 "Nobody touches the Lonely Planet for budget travel advice," states the back cover of this book.   I just finished travelling around Southeast Asia with this as my primary guidebook. It includes the basics for getting around, eating, etc... but it really is just the basics. I have used other books from the lonely planet series in the past, and have found them good enough to continue using, at least until this volume. It has been 5 years since I was in this region last, and things have changed. Especially the guidebook, which was once a rich trove of off-the-beaten-path hints and tips. Increasingly, however, it seems that the Lonely Planet authors seem less interested in helping you find a unique experience and more interested in serving up a cookie-cutter, package tourist rehash. I have a couple grievances with this book:    -It insists on constantly pointing out little sidebars entitled "Splurge!" which indicate ways that the budget traveller can spend a great deal of money in one shot. Why this is in a travel guide called "shoestring" I couldn't tell you. Neither do the authors, but I suppose we can assume that backpackers are interested in spending $5 a night for a couple of months and then blowing $150 to stay in some posh hotel in Kuala Lumpur or racking up an additional $20 in credit card debt for an entirely forgettable dining experience in Bangkok. I just don't feel these are relevant to 99% of actual budget travellers, but they waste a lot of space that could be much better used on greater detail. But I will get to that in a minute.    -Another issue I have is the lack of actual information about actually moving from one place to the next cheaply.  Cheap local transport is available in many of the places covered in the book.  For some reason though, the book usually offers helpful advice like 'just take a cab,' or 'buses are so cheap, so don't bother with local transport.'  As an independent traveler that actually enjoys saving money AND spending time with the locals (what's the purpose of traveling again?!?!), I regret the lack of information about local transport.    -The maps in the book, though better than some in past editions, leave much to be desired. Streets are incorrectly labeled or in the wrong place, intersections are vaguely marked, and occasionally they add a street that doesn't exist or remove a street that does. Worst of all, in a region that prides itself on an almost complete lack of road signage, not many good landmarks are given to orient oneself. There is little that is less fun on the road than standing in front of a train station, staring at one's new alien surroundings, being hassled by touts who are trying to steer you in the wrong direction while trying to find that cheap hostel you read about.    Look, if you want a run-of-the-mill book to complete a run-of-the-mill trip, by all means, you will find this book quite helpful.  But if you are looking for that individual experience that is the beauty of independent travel, you might be best going with a different guide for this region.    By the way, the quote I wrote at the beginning should be viewed as a warning rather than an enticemen 
 POWER OF PERSUASION By Elizabeth Massie (1999)  RATING:  2/5 Stakes  SETTING:  Season Three  CAST APPEARANCES:  Buffy, Angel, Willow, Xander, Giles, Oz, Anya, Cordelia, Joyce, Principal Snyder, Hank Summers  MAJOR ORIGINAL CHARACTERS:  Allison Giankous (Greek student); Radello Giankous (Allison's father); Mo Moon, Polly Moon, Calli Moon (Muses); Viva (vampire)  BACK-OF-THE-BOOK SUMMARY:  "When the female population of Sunnydale starts strutting its girl power, the push for gender equality seems like a normal expression of `90s feminism.  After all, a girl trying out for the football team isn't usually a sign of imminent danger.  But when the guys start acting like powerless pawns and a few even turn up dead, Buffy Summers notices that the local womyn's movement has reached a feverish--and probably unnatural--pitch.  The Slayer is the only one who can see straight during the ultimate battle of the sexes.  Her friends--including Giles--are spellbound by the malignant muses permeating the school.  Even the local vampires are acting strange.  Alone in her search for answers, Buffy must figure out who's behind the sinister sisterhood . . . and close the gender gap before the feminist revolution goes too far."  REVIEW  Power of Persuasion starts out strong, introducting us to Sunnydale student Allison Giankous and her father, Radello.  When the latter suddenly decides to open up a restaurant, Allison is mortified by her father's terrible cooking and cluelessness about running a business.  Not a standard Buffy book opening by any means, but providing one-shot characters with interesting backgrounds and personalities makes their inevitable meetings with the Scooby Gang far more interesting than normal.  Crisp dialogue, humor, and a certain sense of . . . "meanness" successfully draws the reader in and bodes well for the rest of the book.  Unfortunately, the strong opening is followed by lacklustre middle and a disappointing ending.  The plot of Power of Persuasion involves a trio of ancient Greek muses coming to Sunnydale and starting up a war between the sexes by entrancing women (and some men) into becoming militant and aggressive.  Unfortunately, what could have been an interesting story about female empowerment (a core theme of Buffy to begin with) or even the evils of reverse-discrimination becomes an almost farcical caricature of modern feminism and is rather boring to boot.  After making Allison and her father interesting characters, each gets entranced by the muses and loses both the reader's and the story's interest.  (On a side note, Xander, Giles, and Willow all get entranced as well; I think a moratorium should have been established early on prohibiting the alreadly-incredibly cliched mind-controlling of Scoobies.)  The muses themselves have an incredibly dorky backstory involving the Titanic, while the story's ending is sappy and the way Buffy kills the muses is almost laughable (in an unintentional way).  There are some nice bits:  Buffy feeling torn between her mother and father; Buffy and Oz having a debate over nature vs. nurture on gender attitudes; and Buffy's visit to a funeral home to find liquified brains.  Still, in the final analysis, I'm really not sure what happened to make the book so bad after a promising beginning.  I suppose the moral of the story is that even good dialogue and characterization is not always enough to redeem a story with a poorly thought-out plot.

 This book was ok but it could have been better. the stories were too short each story was only about 2 to 3 pages long so you get very little info. on the places and ghost. This book was easy to put down and pick up again the next day it just did not keep me wanting to read like other books. 
 I bought this book because i love cooking and love arabic food.the recipes in the book are good but the problem is that even if followed very carefully,the meals do not come out.they are always eighter undercooked, overcooked or just plain flavorless.The cooking times and temperatures are always off!Worst cookbook i ever bought!I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because a few of the salads and beverages were ok,the rest is a waste 
 What a disappointment.  I cared nothing about the charecters, and the plot never showed up. If you want to read about the government, pick up Clancy 
 Although a cd teaching Catalan is great, it really needs to have the guide in order to use it properly. This is not clear in the description 
 The author contradict himself by considering himself a Christian and then criticize some passage from the bible, this a mean less book, what he was trying to say that the bible has been deviated from its original text, as a Christian I have a difficulty to accept that because it show God disability to keep his words as intended to be, and make God  loss his creditability and honestly dealing with human, please God forgive me for saying that, it will better to proclaim himself as atheist, this is mean less book and show the author foolishness and idiocy 
 We bought this scanner for scanning documents while traveling and the resolution and capacity are not as advertised.  The resolution and quality of the scanned image is grainy and not clear at all.  The scanner also holds a lot fewer pages than advertised. 
 Lots of detail description thru-out the years of the 356. Good for telling the differences between the years. No history and introduction. No color pictures. Could not find any information about the specs of the various engines supplied thru the years. There are some guessing in the book which is always a no-no for publishing a book like this 
 I rented this movie for $1, and when it was done, said, "Well, I lost a dollar, and two hours of my life."  My husband's review:  "I'd rather be tortured than watch that movie again."  It was one of the worst we've ever seen.  It started out well, and had that cute little girl actress who was in both Smallville and Supernatural, but as another reviewer said, "the plot was tangled beyond repair," and I think that's a good way to describe it.  We found ourselves wishing it would end, and then it just continued to drag on and on.  The CGI was really inferior too.  And we thought Dark Water was bad! 
 Very Pretty but a limited number of arms and my family was not even in the book.  For such an expensive work, I expected my family to be there 
 I was very pleased with the book,"Wurthering Heights" and the service in sending it to me.   THank you. 
 Myths are important, but they should not be labeled history.  1.  George Washington was not a great guerilla leader; he commanded conventional forces who fought in lines--just like the redcoats. Washington thought militia and irregulars were undisciplined and unable to face regular troops. 2.  Ronald Reagan did not begin the nuclear "disarming" of the Soviet Union.  Eisenhower and Kennedy tried, but (LBJ?) Nixon and Carter were able to bring the ABM treaty, the SALT treaties and he START treaties to a point where both sides began cutting back their nuclear arsenals.  Reagan did have success with theater wrapons in Europe, but the "big nukes" that could end civilization were already being cut back.  This is an interesting book about Reagan and Peggy Noonan, but some of the history cited is WRONG 
 Fine acting, especially by Morgan Freeman. Unfortunately the drunk but brilliant lawyer is a bit of a  cinematic cliche. Then we have to deal with the conspiracy by the military and the husband being the fall guy. (Don't read any further if you want to watch this movie)  So we go through this whole conspiracy investigation, the General is sufficiently blackmailed to have the charges dropped, then the guy ends up as having done it after all. So then the conspiracy was really a bogus plot device to mislead the audience. The phone taps,Ashley Judd being followed, getting beaten up, etc, etc, etc, all misdirection by the writers and director. but the cast and acting were all good 
 This DVD gives documentary coverage concerning such DA VINCI CODE topics as Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Scion, the Knights Templar, the Gnostic Gospels, Le Dossier Secrets, Da Vinci paintings, and Opus Dei.  This DVD, BEYOND THE DA VINCI CODE seems to bend over backwards, measuring every narrated word, to try to support and be sympathetic towards the Dan Brown allegations made in his novel--despite the evidence and expert interviews that they themselves provide in this documentary, they still seem to be in favor of what Dan Brown has written in the DA VINCI CODE.  Out of a half dozen expert interviewees, the most notable are two "big" names who are MAJOR influences on THE DA VINCI CODE book. Margaret Starbird, author of THE WOMAN WITH THE ALABASTER JAR; and Richard Leigh, one of three authors of HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL, (which was a NY Times Bestseller in 1982), both appear throughout this program.   These two are probably the biggest proponents of the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy today, after Dan Brown himself. So it is especially meaningful when Richard Leigh and Margaret Starbird disagree with what Dan Brown has written!  According to expert interviewee Richard Leigh, though THE DA VINCI CODE book says that the Knights Templar found documents to prove the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy, in reality, NOBODY knows what, if anything, was found by the Knights Templar in Solomon's Temple.   Leigh also says the whole business about the pentagram, pentacles, 5-pointed stars as mainly representing the "sacred feminine" is NONSENSE--that symbol has been used throughout history to represent other things just as often!   Richard Leigh also explains that the original Priory of Scion was last referenced in 1619, but the modern day Priory of Scion people from the last 50 years are "bonkers," trying to present a hoax of the LE DOSSIER SECRETS, to try to gain political influence for themselves.   This LE DOSSIER SECRETS, which appears on the bogus "FACT" page at the beginning of THE DA VINCI CODE book attempts to show a traceable genealogy of descendents of Jesus, but has been debunked for decades in France. It does NOT belong on a page titled "FACT" in the DA VINCI CODE book! That is very misleading, not factual. Brown says the LE DOSSIER SECRETS were discovered, but leaves out the fact that they are commonly known to be phoney!  Margaret Starbird, another major influence on the Dan Brown novel, says that even though she believes in the Jesus/Magdalene bloodline, there is NO PROOF of the bloodline lasting into the French Merovingian line of kings, circa the first millenium A.D.  The documentary, using other expert interviewees and location footage, goes on to debunk the ridiculous claim of the Rose Line alignments being found in significant locations throughout THE DA VINCI CODE novel; as well as showing there is no evidence that Leonardo Da Vinci was a member of the Priory of Scion, let alone the Grandmaster; the rose is NOT the symbol for the Priory of Scion; and Opus Dei has NO INTEREST in the "secret" bloodline of Jesus/Magdalene because they don't believe it even exists.  Sadly, most of the debunking occurs towards the end of the show, in brief statements, before quickly moving on to the next topic; while most of the screen time is spent romanticizing and retelling what Dan Brown's DA VINCI CODE book claims about the Jesus/Magdalene conspiracy.  Overall I was disappointed by this HISTORY CHANNEL DVD for presenting such seemingly wishful support while showing that so much just ain't so in the DA VINCI CODE book--though I am not surprised, the HISTORY CHANNEL usually sides against Christianity on issues to support atheism in their shows, in my opinion.  A much better DA VINCI CODE debunking DVD is BREAKING THE DA VINCI CODE, which more clearly presents the evidence without romanticizing the novel's lies about history and Jesus 
 This book is a heap of arrant nonsens 
 We received this product for Christmas in 2005 and within two weeks the console broke. We contacted Schwinn immediately and was told we would receive a replacement console. It is now May 1st and the console we need is still on backorder --- 5 MONTHS!!!!! It is absolutely ridiciulous. I call each week and I get the same response.  Unfortunately, we should have contacted Amazon within the 30 day period to get reconciliation from Amazon. Lesson learned there.  The product when it was working was fine. But the pain since then is not worth it.   I do not recommend this product 
 I saw this with an open mind, as some modern remakes have been pretty good.  This was not one of them.  Other than the title and number of children, this bore absolutely no resemblance to either the original with Henry Fonda and Lucille Ball, or the book it was based on (Who Gets the Drumstick? -- Helen Beardsley).  The main theme of this movie seemed to be "how stupid can we make our parents look".  If you are going to remake a movie, try to make it better, rather than just trying to capitalize on the earlier movie's name and popularity 
 I am a proclaimed lover of musicals and movie musicals and I was incredibly disappointed by Gigi. As if the overdone french accents aren't enough to turn one off altogether the acting is ridiculously overdramatic and forced. The one redeeming thing in most musicals is at least the song and dance aspect, however for me that might have been the worst part. The songs were repetitive and catchy in a way that makes you want a lombotomy or temporary memory loss to get those stupid tunes and words out of your head. The moral of this story is, spend your time and money on the plethora of wonderful movie musicals and stay far away from this on 
 This book presents a lot of information in an uninteresting way and doesn't break any new ground.  One of the first chapters by Felber states that the best hitters hit early in the count as once hitters have worked themselves into 2-strike counts, their batting averages drop sharply.  Of course they do. That's because with 2 strikes, you can strike out on the next pitch. With 0 or 1 strike, a batter can do a lot of things with the next pitch, but one of them isn't striking out. And striking out is the end result of a lot of at bats.  The chapter on bullpen usage makes some sense, but the examples given are presented poorly 
 This text will be a chore to read for most American students who are new to GIS.  Although the author(s) manage to cram alot of information into the relatively short chapters, the sentences are long and difficult to understand because of the overly wordy, jargon-filled 'proper' use of British English & spellings.  If you decide to purchase this book, then I highly recommend the 'Oxford Unabridged English Dictionary' to go along with it.  The majority of the students in my class "Geographic Information Systems I" at Southwest Texas State University, which has one of the best geography programs in the nation, felt the same way I do, and also thought that the book was too advanced for an introductory GIS class.  I think that the professors at Southwest Texas State University are now using a different text for that class.  Also, people always complain that books tend to be geared toward a single software program- Well, like it or not, in the United States, ESRI has a monopoly on geographic software so you are going to have to learn ArcView/Info one way or another 
 This has not aged well. The scripts are silly, the acting is of the "chewing up the scenery" variety. Gale Storm no longer seems cute; she comes across as annoyingly perky. Spend your money on something else 
 This book is written in an engaging fashion for younger readers, so that's why I gave it 2 stars. But I found the attitudes conveyed towards slavery, Native Americans, and Democrats unsettling. I think there are some political motives behind this book. I think the author is trying to indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative Southern Republican political ideas, and a brand of Christianity that makes people outside the church (you know, the OTHER people God loves) think Christ-followers are hateful and crazy.   For example, on p36 it states, "Although it is true that Native Americans were often treated badly by European settlers, they treated one another worse" and "We cannot feel so much pity for the Native Americans when we think of all this." Did they have it coming? They faught and killed each other like every other group of humans on the planet, so we shouldn't feel bad about the injustices perpetrated by white European settlers that the Natives have never recovered from?  And on the two pages that deal with slavery, it is mentioned that the slave trade was profitable for the traders, but "hard on the slaves" who were shipped to the colonies "under difficult conditions." A bit of an understatement.   And, on the subject of the Civil War, "Many people in the south did not own slaves, but they knew how quickly the Southern economy and standard of living would be damaged if the Northern politicians forced Southern farmers to immediately free their slaves." Yikes, what about the slaves' standard of living? No where is it mentioned or even alluded to that slavery in the US was BAD and WRONG. It's not okay to own another human being and treat him or her like an animal (or WORSE).   The reason the North abolished slavery? They had MACHINES to do the work of slaves, so slaves became obsolete. And I quote, "...why slavery was done away with in the Northern states. The reason is primarily that Northern businessmen did not need slave labor to operate their stores and factories because they made much greater use of the new machines that cut down on the amount of hand labor that was necessary to complete a job." No mention of how compassionate Christians (and others) were vehemently opposed to the way slave owners viewed, kept and treated their slaves, or what they did to abolish slavery.  Finally, the treatment of Democrats and Republicans is really unbalanced. The only things mentioned about Carter? How horrible he was for establishing relations with China, that he messed up with the Panama Canal, and his debaucling of the Iran hostage situation. "In short, our country had sunk to new lows during the Carter years." Clinton's claims to fame are creating a huge government against the Constitution and the will of the people (who promptly reelected him), meddling in Bosnia and other war-torn nations, promoting homosexuality, and Monica Lewinsky. (WHY are these last two issues in a book for 9-year-olds?) In contrast, the Repubs get ONLY positive press in this text.  Finally, the book also says on p178, "Sadly, our country's Supreme Court ruled in 1962 that it was illegal for children to pray in the public schools." That's not true. That law pertains to adult-led corporate prayer, but does nothing to prevent a CHILD from praying in school.  If this book is in line with your political views, then you might want to buy it. But I have a hard time believing that anyone in this day and age thinks SLAVERY was really not such a bad thing. For that reason, no one should by it. This text could be supplemented with something more truthful regarding slavery, like a parent-censored version of "The Slave Narratives," which records hundreds of interviews with former slaves about their lives as slaves and after emancipation. 
 I was disappointed, after reading several reviews that implied this is a scary movie that has been overlooked by the general public.  I'm a fan of made for tv 70's scary movies, and love movies that have things that go bump in the night, or hauntings, or scary old houses.  This movie was basically more psychological, and not scary at all.  The so-called surprise ending was not developed enough to make sense.  The directing was  poor, and all in all, I'm so frustrated that I spent money on this film.  It's priced at only 4.99 now, so that may be worth it, if the shipping is free.  It's cheaper than renting it, but you'll probobly never want to watch it again, so why own it 
  I enjoyed the Forward to the book. The, albeit, brief reference to 'elegance' being a package - the importance of a great walk and pleasant voice being a given. After the 'Forward' I found the book progressively downhill. Sure, there was the usual worthwhile guidance - the quintessential little black dress, simplicity- less is more and choose quality over quantity - but hardly groundbreaking for anyone with more than a cursory knowledge of fashion. Much of the text stressed silly, outdated and/or erroneous rules- don't wear black in the morning, don't wear bright coloured shoes except in the evening, choose neutral handbags in black and brown (much prefer Kimora's ideas in 'Fabulosity' she suggests choosing handbags in cherry, emerald or orange -let's face it, way more colorful and interesting), women over 21 look better in one piece swimsuits-(surely this is a matter of abdominal firmness- a 40 year old can look stunning in a bikini an overweight 16yr old not so). It went on to refer to Queen Elizabeth as a style icon. As I read the book, I kept seeing glimpses of a girlfriend. She's 40, well groomed, always wears expensive quality clothes but frankly it's all deathly dull - there is no individuality, no surprise in her dress, seems aging- it fits her partner is decades older.  'A Guide To Elegance' focuses on rigidity in fashion (heavy on do's and dont's)which has hopefully been surpassed by CREATIVITY. Interesting, youthful dressing is pleasing at any age and gives vibrancy and youth- my brother in law's mum,70 wore a colorful folk skirt and matching bright shoes to Christmas lunch and looked wonderful. Many readers have commented on compliments when implementing the book but when you give thought and time to your wardrobe, coordinating pieces and ensuring all is clean and fresh, shoes polished etc, hair and make up well done, a great walk and smile and then... irrespective of any supposed 'fashion' book you will indeed be stunning and elegant.            
 Do not buy this book if you want to learn anything meaningful or "real world" about game theory.  The author's examples are irrelevant and in some cases not applicable to game theory constructs.  
 the beginning of this book was excellent, but dont be fooled, the first few chapters are the only decent part of this book.  the rest of the book is just filled with sex and the ultimate downfall is that there is no foreshadowing to the killers. what's the point of writing it if the reader cant try to figure out who the murderers were.  this was one of the worst books i have ever read, i'd call it a trashy romance novel with a hint of mystery. dont waste your time reading it 
 I read about half of this book. There was a lot detailed information about Hume's positioning in English and French Societies and Rousseau's many problems, but nothing that engaged me with these characters. It was not very novelistic and there was not much discussion of their ideas or of the broad social and intelectual contexts that made them interesting. Maybe things picked up in the second half 
 I agree with a previous reviewer who titled his review: "Mulisch, Pedant... writes a book."  Pedant seems the perfect term.  It is a collection of ideas that are thrown together, but not developed.  730 pages of time that I will never have back.  Not only was the book pretentious, it was also poorly written.  Perhaps the translation is to blame, as I read it in English.  Whatever the source, the (English) text was choppy, un-inventive, repetitive, and cliché.  Mulisch's overuse of similes is nauseating.  The dialogue was also suspect.  Instead of realistic, it seemed more the types of smart retort one thinks of only after an argument has concluded.  I'm at a loss as to what other reviewers see in this book.  Hopefully it works better in the original Danish.  Maybe it was just the wrong book at the wrong time for me, and I have missed the message.  However, now I am reading Orwell as a sort of antidote - and it feels a whole lot better.  I would suggest that you skip straight to that if you are looking for literature.  (Kidding about the Danish thing, by the way. 
 Please note that this may have been a great book when it was written in 1999, but how any review in 2005 can recommend this book with four stars is beyond me.  A very serious genetic disorder in Cavaliers has become TOO common and is found in all bloodlines.  This disease, which did not become widely identified in Cavaliers until 2003, should be thoroughly researched by anyone interested in acquiring a Cavalier.  It is not in this book.  Go into this with your eyes wide open.  We love our Cavalier and would not trade him for anything.  But he has had major brain surgery at a prestigious university vet hospital, pre- and post-surgical MRI's, and is on expensive medication 3 times daily.  He cannot be walked on a leash because of pain, even with the medication.  If you want "cutesy" information, buy a book.  If you want real information, go on-line.    Added from Cavalier Health on 9/13/2006:  "Researchers conservatively estimate that at least 50% of CKCSs have occipital hypoplasia (or caudal occipital malformation syndrome -- COMS), the skull bone malformation believed to cause syringomyelia. 
 Don't waste your time on this 
 This is one of the few instances that I have found in which the movie version of a novel is better than the novel itself.  This is a contrived work through and through, and one can understand why Bertolucci completely changed the ending for the movie.  Moravia here displays his utter sentimentality with an admixture of arm-chair psychology that is truly laughable....and this is probably his best novel 
 ridicolous creatureattaks a bar full of strange characters.it starts out pretty good whith the introductions of the characters but goes own hill fast when it bings nothing new just more gore.Krista allen however is always great to look at and she does not dissapoint in feast eighter,if only there was more of her to look at,that would have helped the movie a lot.ps does any one else think baltazar ghetty is a illigitamate son of martin sheen.Because he looks like two drops of water like charlie sheen in everything he does 
 I wish I had read the other reviews first.  Though the quality of the episode and the video are top notch, the episode cuts off after 22 minutes.  Obviously, I already know the ending of "The Black Death", but I still wanted to see the full show 
 A recipe for remaking the world to conform with the authors' wishes. If only everyone could be more like them (a speechwriter & poly scientist/insider/entrepreneur) - the world would be perfect (And all who disagree dead).  Since this epistle was published, Mr. Perle (leading Iraq war advocate 1996-2003) has avoided a definitive response to former SEC chairman Richard Breeden's committee allegations that his role as a key director enabled Lord Black to loot Hollinger (of $300 million). This was only the latest controversy in a resume that includes alleged self serving advocacy for Global Crossing, Loral, Boeing, and several others. All admirably preemptively defended by his Canadian co-author in the press (unmentioned in the book).  Mr. Perle resigned as Chair of the Defense Policy Board, then from the DPB altogether. One wonders if it was to deflect scrutiny over past comments ("In Iraq itself, his - Saddam's - downfall would be met with dancing in the streets" -- NYTimes 28 Dec 2001; "If we had to finance it ourselves, I think we would be better off doing that than inviting in those who were opposed to this war of liberation...But we won't have to finance it ourselves because happily, Iraq has very substantial indigenous resources that can be put to the service of rebuilding Iraq, and let me just observe in that connection, that there was very little damage from this war." -- AEI Coffee, 15 April 2003).  This book is well worth reading. It's lucid and well written. Mr. Frum is a talented advocate. In the end, it's value is as testimony to a failed (if not criminal) proposition.  Google the authors' contemporary public source comments over the years, compare them with current reality, and decide for yourself.  I wouldn't hire this pair to fix a toilet, let alone the worl 
 Mr. Starr seems know a lot about China, but I don't think he understand China based on what he wrote in his book. His conclusion that "an abrupt collapse of the Party-state" is  unlikely to happen. Just like those who predict Hong Kong will be a chaos after return to China's rule, Mr Starr failed to realize the fundermental change in China these days which will lead to a more stable China 
 Dated, derivative, self-indulgent & unintelligent.  This is truly bottom of the range stuff.  The acting, directing, soundtrack and script are all dire.  None of the characters are even remotely sympathetic, in fact I was hoping they'd die slowly and painfully.  I note that Billy Bob Thornton was both star and a scriptwriter - methinks his true nature is revealed in the script and the part he chose - an arrogant, amoral, misogynistic, self-important coward (with zero sense of humour).  Don't waste your time watching this drivel, it will leave you with a bad taste in your mouth that no amount of tequila can erase.  
 This is something I would find on a humor website. And it's not very good. Most of the jobs listed is only held by a few people and not what I call real jobs. There is a show on The Discovery Channel that is titled "Dirty Jobs". One job that Racz mentions was featured on it. Chicken sexer. And what the job is about is quickly finding out what sex the baby chicks are. But he mentions silly stuff mostly like Saddam Hussein Double and Exorcist. A few real ones like Data Entry and Shopping Cart Valet.   I got this book from the library by placing it on hold. If I saw the inside of this book I wouldn't have bothered with it.  
 The Book of Jasher was in fact a real book, but it has been lost for over 2500 years.  It is mentioned twice in the Old Testament, in Joshua and in Samuel---it is a book that recorded great victories of the Jews.  This book that is sold now is simply a hoax, made up by some fools who want to get some easy money from uneducated people 
 I don't mean to criticize the author whom I;ve been told is one of the greatest novelists of French literature.  However, this translation I read was rather dry.  THe whole plot rather stays in a single place.  THe  heroine Lea always laments that she is getting older and gaining weight and  other effects of age. I disliked Cheri for being such a wimp and for always  acting like a child.   Cheri of course isn't the devoted husband to Edmee  and sleeps with Lea.  However, Edmee is much younger than Cheri and remains  a very patient wife.  THe desire of Cheri for LEa is pretty clear.  But  this is one of those tortured romances in which the two people keep  desiring each other, torture each other that they re not together, and live  in perpetual sadness.  It's pretty depressing.  I wanted a juicy, racy  novel that I could curl up with.  But there are No racy parts. I would have  preferred if there were descriptions of the psychological states of  unfulfilled desire but there is none.  It's boring because the beginning  and the end and the middle are pretty much the same.  In fact, you can get  the whole idea of the novel just by reading the first chapter.  You're  wasting your time if you read any further.  Some of the idioms are pretty  awkward.  Perhaps a new translation would be more welcomed 
 In recycling Blakney's translation from the 1950's, Signet is trying to get something for nothing, namely, your money for a lousy out-dated translation.  Not only does Blakney misread the Chinese grammar in several places, his interpretations are both under-thought and under-written.  If an inexpensive translation is what you're looking for, Penguin has a $5 D.C. Lao translation that isn't all that bad.  If, however, you want really excellent translations, here's my advice:  For a more interpretive Neo-Taoist reading, pick up Victor H. Mair's.  This is a good place to start reading the Tao Te Ching, in my opinion.  If, however, you want a truly excellent translation, Philip J. Ivanhoe has done quite nicely.  Moss Robert's translation is just as good overall, but also includes notes on the differences between the MaWangDui and Guodian texts compared to the Wang Bi (which is what he and everyone translates), so that'd be my ideal choice.  Don't buy this book, it's a cheap way for the publishing house to try and score some sales from nothing at all. 	I'm currently working on a research piece on translations of P'u in the English texts, so these critiques come as the result of my working with all these books 
 The foundation of success in a horror story is a strong, original beginning.  The author must grab your attention and earn your suspension of disbelief.  Dean Koontz failed to make this upfront investment in The Taking.  The story caroms off of a long series of hackneyed horror elements - stormy night, body snatchers, magic mirrors, ghouls, and (Koontz's favorite) Delphic dogs - before settling down with a very modest storyline about a non-denominational rapture.    Koontz can usually be counted on to deliver some pleasant thrills or humor if not the chills of real horror.  But The Taking provides no such return 
 What a disaster. Stay away from this film. I was so disappointed--how could this have won the Academy Award?! The story is rambling and confused, as if the filmmakers couldn't decide what story they wanted to tell. The animation is very average, with the exception of a few striking scenes of natural landscapes. In fact, those all-important "happy feet" of the main character just kind of jerk and slide around a bit. (That's supposed to be tap-dancing? that's supposed to be "animation?") The jokes aren't particularly funny (with the exception of a few moments in the middle where Robin Williams briefly shines). And oddly enough for a film whose central conceit centers on music and dancing, there's not a single original song, or even an inspired remake of any of the songs. Think "Billy Elliot" meets "The March of the Penguins" with some  of Gore's "An Inconvenient Truth" mixed in--without any of the wit, charm, intelligence, passion, or beauty in any of those films. (Did I mention that this film is a disaster?)  Perhaps most annoyingly, like the rest of the story, the underlying political message alternates between cliched, confused, and heavy-handed. The ending is especially unbearable, with its tacked-on feel and absurd psuedo-environmentalist feel-good solution. What a joke! Personally, I consider myself quite liberal and sympathetic to environmentalist positions (I've been a vegetarian for more than 20 years, and a member of Sierra Club and PETA, for example), yet the way this movie presents its misguided message offended me greatly--not least because of the utter inconsistency and incomprehensibility of the message.  One final note for those of you with children: this is not really a kids movie. Most of the jokes won't be understood by children under 15. For kids under 6, all this feeble film offers is some too-scary "Shamus" (orcas), a terrifyingly ferocious sea lion inexplicably made to growl like a dinosaur and given outsized teeth in a deformed mouth, and a jarring ending that suddenly switches to live-action scenes where adults heatedly debate environmental action in such kid-friendly forums as the United Nations! (What the heck?!) After sitting through the entire film to this point, my four-year-old son finally turned to me and quietly said, "This is not a movie for me."  I couldn't have agreed more 
 My favorite show of the Trek series but there's no way I'd buy another individual program from Amazon.  It will ONLY play on their downloaded player ...won't burn to DVD so can't play it on my television.  Don't bother buying this ...just go for the Trek collection on DVD 
 I have to admit that Cantor is an incredible historian. The book happens to be a great book for information. And it is also an easy book to read, compared to most books on Jewish History. The problem I had with this book is that he made me feel very uncomfortable. Whenever something happened in History he has his own ideology which happens to be terrible. It was so sad for me to see how a person can write a book on the Jews, and make us look pretty bad. One thing is forsure that Cantor must have a grudge on orthodox Jews. Acc. to him it seems that the orthodox were always the ones at fault.  To top it off, he couldnt find anything nice to say about the Bal Shem Tov. To me I dont understand why Cantor has such negative views on Jews. My favorite of course is the way he ends off his book with his suppositon synopsis of the Jewish future. It was pretty gloomy. Acc. to Cantor in fifty years bc of assimilation we will be pretty much finished off. I dont know where he lives, but this past Hannukah if he turned on the T.V. for a second he would have seen Jews celebrating the holiday like never before, all over the entire world. Did i forget to write that when i finished the book i had a sick taste left in my mouth. ltennenhaus@hotmail.co 
 Despite what T. Smith (another reviewer) states, Jesus was under no vegetarian obligation.  God has made multiple covenants with his followers, and in each covenant the previous one was replaced.  Thus post-Noah followers could eat meat, and post-Jesus followers had no obligation to be kosher.  Which brings me to my main point: why should one feel any significance in eating what Jesus ate?  He was still obligated to follow the kosher rules of Deuteronomy, while modern day Christians are not.  If the book is kosher, it need not be, and if it isn't, it can't possibly contain what Jesus ate.  Jesus was kosher.  Basically, this is a pretty stupid premise for a book.  Eat what you want - God won't care 
 The item looks cheap. I ordered a medium size but it was 2X bigger than the regular size. "Ugly 
 I received my book a few days ago. I must say I was kind of disappointed. To pay $23.95 + shipping for a small paperback book with mostly black and white pictures. I think the book will be a good read and provide me with some good tips, but I think most of the pictures should have at least been in color to really get the ideas across and easy to see. I guess I thought that even though it was a paperback that it would be a larger book with better pictures. 
 Not a good book at all.  Delivery of new material is extremely "uneven".  Some topics are covered quite well, yet others are in desperate need for more explanation.  Some concepts given in earlier chapters are only being explained later on.  Misprints are also abound.  Many examples simply don't work.  
 Somewhat useful for those ignorant of France.  However, Ardagh is for all the modernist leftist ideals.  Abortion is good.  Feminism is delightful.  Socialism is grand as long as it doesn't go too far.  Anything traditionalist belongs in the wastebasket.  Now that France is slowly dying and maybe a generation away from social upheaval, one must understand that Ardagh's idealizing modern France is mistaken.  France, modern France, Ardagh's France, is going down the tubes 
 I think the shaver works well,but the plastic is thin and cheap. The biggest complaint is that there is no carring case for the razor,cleaning brush and charger. I think the cost should of been higher if that is what it takes to provide a case 
 I hate to be the only critic, but I feel I must interject here for all the skeptics out there. The reviews for this book must be coming from an extremely specific-and therefore biased beyond belief-group of people. Never fear! I am here to save the day with an (I'm sure) equally biased answer to the opposite side. This book is championed for its elevated action and incredible adventure, but truth be told, I found myself bored throughout the novel, always desiring to skim large portions to get to the "good part" (which never arrived by the way). The novel lacked cohesion and organic unity, and felt disjointed at best. This, however, must be forgiven in a novel of this ilk. After all, we don't expect our fantastic adventure novels to rank among esteemed literature. What can be expected, I think, is a page-turning, voracity-inspiring, un-put-down-able (forgive me for lack of concision but it had to be said) novel and you will not find that here. Perhaps I have high standards, but if the book is poorly written, I at least have the right to demand that it doesn't bore me to a dire degree, right? I believe the main problem is that David Gemmel fails at putting you in touch, emotionally, with the story line and characters. First off, his characterization is non-existent, leaving the characters static and uniform. I get the feeling that he wished to represent characters as human, being neither the extreme of good or evil (an admirable goal), but he failed. Guy Gavriel Kay, for one, champed Gemmel here. In his book, I could not help but be utterly empathetic to both sides of the fight. In Gemmel's novel, I was merely confused by the sudden, and seemingly random, changes in character. If he is attempting to elucidate development, or the double-sided nature of people, he executes it poorly. For example, Kaelin lashes out in the beginning of the novel when a friend dies. Later, however, he is extremely calm in the face of a much closer relative's death. In the mean time, no development, mentally is exclaimed. If he is suddenly wise and accepting of the world, it's deus ex machina style. I truly believe that none of this would be true but for the extreme dearth of characterization. In any case, I felt left out in the metaphorical cold, apathetic to the fate of the characters. My other major complaint is that the way he constructed the plot was bewildering and nonsensical to me. It played out multiple inapropos lines of the story, while leaving the critical prophecy unfulfilled and unexplained. To be fair, this is part of a series I believe, though it is difficult to tell which part as that is not referenced anywhere that I can find. If it is meant to stand alone, it certainly fails. Honestly though, from the most purely analytic point of view possible, the plot was ineptly done and baffling at best. It truly lacked cohesion. This is all not to mention the fact that the dialogue was awkward and the prose mediocre. Succinctly said, I would not recommend reading this book, but don't take my word for it. Many other reviewers seem to praise the concise characterization that I hated 
 This book is remarkable in one way--it accurately represents the fantasies of many a teenage girl.  Yes, Jim really sang to YOU, even encoding special messages in his songs. ("If I WERE to say to you..." in the Ed Sullivan Show is actually a response to Ashcroft's grammar critique, who knew?) Yes, this 20-something man was entralled both intellectually and physically by a nerdy (by her own account) teenager and what he really wanted to do was trade not particularly high brow literary analogies for hours on end.  Yes, you were the only one who truly grasped the meaning of the Doors.  And this goes on for hundreds of pages.  Towards the end, I began to worry seriously about Ashcroft's mental state.   This book adequately represents the fantasy life of the pubescent, but, alas, is no more true than my high school fantasies.  And not only does it have teenager appropriate content, it also has a writing style that could have been lifted verbatim from my overwrought high school diaries.  
 Being a Greek myself I was incredibly disgusted and offended by some of the claims that were made in this book. The broad generalities were ridiculous. Not all sorority girls get drunk have sex and are anorexic. In fact over 20 of my 50 members do not drink and we're not even allowed to have scavenger hunts because it is nationally considered "hazing".  More offensive than the picture she paints of sorority girls was the fact that she shared so many secrets about ceremonies.   A great deal of the information she acquired are things that we in our sorority have NEVER written down but has been passed down for over a 10o years through traditions and secret ceremonies. I was upset to see some of these things written down in a book that bashed the greek system.  I'm not saying all greeks are perfect but to conclude that most are like the ones in this book is just upsetting 
 I returned the book. Cumbersome. Not what I expected after a promo on TV had gotten me interested. Signed up and doing Jazzercise instead 
 Be aware that this book is no longer in copyright and anybody can print and sell this book. I bought this book at Amazon and the print is small with poor font clarity. My zeal for the Lord could not overcome the headaches from trying to read this book. The small "a" is usually filled with ink for example. Buy Clarence Larkin books published by the Clarence Larkin Estate which still keeps all of Rev. Larkins' books in print. They still produce the books from plates instead of a copy machine that needs cleaning. May the people of Sun Publishing join the lake of fire yaht club as galley-slaves for Apollyon 
 It took a long, long time, but mentor Michael Jackson finally broke these guys in and made them his own. Now they demonstrate beyond all doubt that they have truly mastered the Old Master's grooves and beats. It must have taken hundreds of hours and much grueling discipline in the Play Room at Neverland Ranch before these young boys finally "got it". But they clearly did "get it" in the end! This is evident from their squeals of childlike glee as they prance across the stage re-enacting their fantasies of a land where no one ever needs to grow old or grow up, where they can play with each other forever in total innocence, blissfully unaware of the icky things adults are rumored to do. Now they are poised to take over where Master Michael left off and will act as shepherds to a whole new flock of young devotees. Bless these sweet young children and may their innocent musical merriment thrive unclouded by the sordid rumors currently swirling around their Master 
 The definitions and thesaurus cross referencing are very good. The user interface is quite honestly shameful.

 I started out reading Chrys Ingraham's White Weddings with positive attitude.  I am very interested with how the "white wedding came about".  As she went on with the book there were a few problems that did not settle with me.  Number one she often used the words wedding and marriage interchangeably.  These words are two very different in definition and shouldn`t be used in place of one another.  The second thing that I found very hard to handle with her book is that she often would make broad generalizations that would have no factually information to support the idea.  Finally when you read the epilogue she says, "writing this book has been a wrenching experience. Without realizing how fully I've been sutured to dominate heterosexual culture, I have frequently found myself engaged in a variety of internal struggles.  Tears would be streaming down my face as I empathized with the characters in a movie while, at the same time, I would be taking notes critiquing the heterosexual imaginary."  It seems to me that she wrote this book as a statement of how she feels and her opinions.  This is great if it is therapy for her but should not be taken as fact or the answer for other people.  The one educational part of the book was the section about how white weddings are capitalized.  Sweatshops are terrible and it is a horrible feeling to know that people work in awful conditions to make your wedding dress.  This is however should not be the main reason to critizes white weddings, but a reason to make changes.  This book was a start of a good idea but in the end turned into someone else's opinion and platform.  After reading this book no one should feel bad about the choices they make for their own weddings just because they don't fit with what Chrys Ingraham's believes.  A person should make decisions based on what feels right for them 
 When I think of the Civil War I think of excitement and danger. I expect  to read a good rich book about it. Yet this book squeezes all the fun out  of thesubject War. Yes, war is nothing fun yet it may be exciting and  detailed. This book totally lacks all this information. Yet it does tell of  the blood thirsty belligerent Generals that are awaiting battle. I have a  love of books, all throughout my life. I have read many too. I highly don't  recommend this book for pleasure reading. Unless you want to get details  for an essay, forget about it 
 The setting of this book is beautiful, exotic, and interesting. The author, unfortunately, does nothing to take advantage of this. I am shocked that this book could possibly have won a National Book Award. It must mean that either the award itself is meaningless, or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year -- which I doubt. The topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else, as far as I am concerned. I can't imagine it being done worse! Tuck's writing style -- short vignettes or episodes, one after another -- is terribly ineffective and disjointed. I felt completely detached from all of the characters. I didn't feel like I gained any understanding of who they were, and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies. Another thing that completely irritated me were Tuck's sexual references. Throughout the novel, Tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter (a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest, for example). These sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader; all they did was gross me out. They were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy, not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story. I don't know what Tuck was trying to do in this novel. I think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level: It is not entertaining. It is not profound. It is not educational. It is not beautiful. At only 248 pages, I can't say it was even a quick read. Utterly forgettable, once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it. 
 This book was required reading my first year in college. It eneded up consuming the entire year in a depessing and dire atmosphere. Every class we talked about the book, it's themes, it's techniques.  Never once did anyone dare to say they disliked the story. How could you say you disliked a personal story about the Holocaust and the ending in which she relays to the entire world that she is homosexual. You couldn't voice an oppinion against this at the risk of being "A Nazi" or a "Homophobe".  I'm risking that to tell every person here that this story was terrible. It was about the author harassing her Holocaust surviving parents over and over again about their terrible ordeal. They wanted to have it in the past, over with, gone, and forgotten. The memories were too hard to dredge up and frankly they were none of their daughter's business. BUT the author Sherlock's the information and writes this book. She then said in the end that she was homosexual when this information had nothing to do with the story. The entire book was a way to "come out" with all the stress on her parents and none on herself.  This indeed was a sad story, but because of the desparate and self centered needs of the author. It's easy to have a best seller when you make your subject matter a taboo subject to disagree with.   Read it if you want and form your own opinions. This is just mine. 
 Wow, these books are about the groovy girls: Gwen, Oki, Vannessa, Yvette, and the twins Reese & O'Ryan.    But they say words that don't mean anything. Here are the four weird words: ` Supreme ` you really only say supreme when your ordering a supreme topping pizza!!!! ` Beautilious ` not even a word!!! ` Fantabulous` Still not even a word...........      ` Superiffic` NOT EVEN A WORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!      Also in the groovy girls 3 book ` Sleepover Surprise` ` A Twin-sational birthday` What Reese says: ` Oh that's so surpreme of you guys` and from Reese: ` Gwen your cinnamon buns are scrump-dilly-umptious` and what Gwen says back: ` Tank you veddy much`             So........ CAUTION: Do not buy!!!!!!!             Thank you for taking your time to read this.          
 Thinly veiled attempt to push politically correctness down the throats of our children, sacrificing the faith and beliefs of their elders in the attempt.  Aren't we so fortunate to have filmmakers to teach our children for us what their priorities and beliefs should be?  Oh pleeeeze! I'm so glad I could watch this one with my daughter so I could point out the obvious attempts at manipulation.  We discussed the issues, and thought for ourselves. 
 The title is misleading, as there is very little useful info on aeromechanics. If you are into balloons using coal gas or hydrogen, buy this book. As a university-level reference work, the section on vortices is  useful. For homebuilding aerodynamics, the book is of little use 
 I found it hard to believe anything these guys said.  They put up strawmen so they could attack other methods of gathering requirements.  Their use cases had exactly the same flaws they criticized earlier in the text.  The book seemed more like a  sermon than a serious discussion of use cases.  On the other hand, it did have lots of step by step detail on how to do use cases. I am looking for another book on use cases 
 Probability and Random Processes can be easily approached with grace and elegance so long as the professor and/or writer possess such talents.  All too often Albert Leon-Garcia comes across as a total wacko in the possession neither 
 I bought the Baby Einstein Sea Crib toy based on its look.  I brought it home, put batteries in it and it worked for 5 minutes before it quit playing sounds.  I was also disappointed that the ocean sound only played for a few seconds.  I had thought it would play for 12 minutes like the music.  I took it back and purchased the Fisher Price aquarium and it is great.  It plays every sound for 10 minutes and seems more durable 
 American lives.  Hannity receives his talking points every day from the RNC, and then repeats them like the Summoner from "Canterbury Tales," repeating his two or three Latin phrases.  Hannity's phrases: - Liberals are giving comfort to the enemy when questioning our president when our soldiers are in harm's way.  - Liberals don't want to defend America and fought Homeland Security every step of the way (when it was Bush who fought it)  - Howard Dean hates republicans, he is unhinged, so is Hillary, Al Gore, John Kerry, and every republican except for Ben Nelson and Joe Lieberman.  - Osama bin laden was offered up to Clinton on a silver platter. (never happened)  So, as Al Franken says, Hannity knows 11 facts, all of which are outright lies, or misrepresentations, so please don't try to confuse him with any nuance or qualifications to the 11 facts he knows.  Don't waste your money on this book - it, and he, are the reason the right and the left can no longer talk to each other.  He is laughing all the way to the bank with his tax cut, begotten on his listeners' backs 
 This movie is nearly 3 hours of hot air as bad as the movie The Hindenburg! If George C Scott saw this movie he would be rolling over in his grave! I yawned so much that I got a charley horse in my neck and nearly had a stroke from being bored to tears! Saddam Hussein should be strapped in a chair and be forced to watch this movie- maybe then would he confess of his atrocities that he committed! Stay as Far and Away from this movie as you can! 
 I began following this author quite a while ago including reading ealier books because there wasn't that much information about baking sourdough bread.  He has simplified the directions a little but I was never successful with his directions until I took a course at King Arthur and discovered that baking sourdoughs isn't all that complicated. Now I make naturally leavened bread almost every week.  I finally trashed the silly "proof box" that Mr. Wood recommends.  I occasionally dip into this book to try the recipes and I'm pretty sure some of them have significant errors (the SF sourdough turns out more like a ciabatta because either the flour or water measurments are wrong).  If you want a really good book on bread baking check out "Bread A Baker's Book of Techniques and Recipes" by Jeffrey Hamelman.  It has lots of good sourdough recipes based on solid baking formulas 
 "Tribulation Force" is not as good as the first book in the "Left Behind" series.  The authors seem to be doing so much maneuvering to get their characters into the right crucial positions around the Antichrist, that there's almost no time left for the story.   I was amused by the authors' description of the Two Witnesses and their miraculous protection by God.  If God could do that sort of miracle, why hasn't he been doing it all along?  A few incidents of such miraculous protection of missionaries would have sufficed to convert millions in countries like China and Japan, not to mention unbelievers in the U.S. Instead, missionaries sent to non-Christian nations have routinely been killed or expelled.  Why would God permit such a thing?  Does He want people to go to Hell?  Rabbi Ben-Judah's speech in "Tribulation Force" about how he's changed his mind and decided that Christ is in fact the Messiah struck me as absurd.  The Bible prophecy that "a virgin shall conceive and bear a Son" does not even appear in the original Hebrew of the Old Testament. The Hebrew word translated as "virgin" would be more correctly translated into English as "young woman."  "Virgin" is nothing more than an ancient mistranslation that has been copied and recopied over the centuries.  As for the rest of the 109 prophecies that the Rabbi claims were fulfilled by Christ, to say that Jesus Christ is the only person who could fulfill them is silly. Most of the Biblical prophecies of the Messiah are vague; with many, it's hard to say whether they even deal with the Messiah or not.  The Book of Isaiah has many of these prophecies, and it can be mighty obscure.  As we have very little solid evidence for Jesus' actual life history, it's very difficult to know if he actually fulfilled any prophecies. Certainly his followers wanted to think he did, and accounts written by his followers are the only ones we have.  The power of wishful thinking is often underestimated, in my opinion.    The "Left Behind" series takes prophecy in general much too seriously.  The Book of Revelations is essentially a collection of predictions, mostly of disasters, worded in highly symbolic language. This is the same trick that Nostradamus used in his prophecies. Since the language is so symbolic, the predictions can be applied to nearly anything. Wait long enough and bad things are, of course, sure to happen. Vague disaster predictions therefore tend to come true all the time. Since the day Revelations was written, people have popped up constantly claiming that now, at last, the predicted events are all happening, and Christ's kingdom is at hand. Is the Rapture coming this time? I don't think so. Are we likely to have some bad times ahead? Yes, but not because God planned it that way. It is humans who are now causing the biggest disasters.  As an atheist, I find the fundamentalist brand of Christianity, which loves to focus on the Rapture, even less appealing than the more ordinary kind. Fundamentalists seem to assume that "God will provide" and that we don't need to think about humanity's future.   If Christianity really worked to make bad people good and good people better, I would be the first to sign up. If Christianity was an effective way to relieve poverty and bring peace, I would definitely consider it. If Christianity were just a silly hobby that made people feel good and harmed no one, it wouldn't bother me. Unfortunately, that isn't what I see. Even when in power, Christianity has made little or no progress in solving the social problems that it deals with, such as poverty and violence. Christianity systematically ignores the most serious problems of our times: overpopulation, exhaustion of resources, and pollution, among others. Why does Christianity ignore these problems? Because they receive little or no attention in the Bible, a book written thousands of years ago.   If you are inclined to believe in the Rapture, I beg you to at least consider some contrary viewpoints. Christ said He would come as a thief in the night. Consider the possibility that He might not come for 500 more years, or 1000. Remember the parable of the talents. Do you want to face Him having ruined the planet He gave us to live on? As far as other fiction, I would suggest Heinlein's book "Job: A Comedy of Justice," which takes belief in the Rapture to its logical conclusion.  
 Bible believers have been known to conform to pretty strange religious teachings but the thought of having sex in a manner that must be pleasing to God has got to be the biggest pile of tripe I have ever come across.  What makes Shmuley Boteach thinks he knows what god likes when one is in the thralls of passion?????  Never mind what your partner likes, as long as the great Peeping Tom in the sky is not turned on then the act is a no-no.  ....... How utterly ridiculous??!!  Readers, as long as the parties involved are consenting adults acting in privacy and it feels good....... DO IT!!!!    Shmuley Boteach should try it some time    
 Okay- I know that this is a seminal work re: the Middle East, but it is as dry as any other history text that you might find on the shelves of MiddleEast 101.  In comparison to Price of Honor or other more reader friendly texts that in my opinion carry as much critical information about the volatile region, it pales in comparison 
 What a great title, laden with the promise of darkness,mystery, surreality... it leads one to expect a fanatasy with a subterranean feel. Unfortunately the book does not live up to the promise its title makes.  Dreams Underfoot by Charles de Lint is an ambitious collection of urban faery stories, all bound together by several common threads and characters. But several factors hold these stories back from being all that they can be.  At first one is enchanted with, if not de Lint's somewhat lackluster prose, at least by the unique themes and plotlines. Unique up until the third or fourth story, that is, when one begins to realize the sad sameness of all these tales. After the first few stories the book becomes a rather tedious read, and one's willingness to forgive de Lint's unremarkable writing style dissipates, like ghosts fleeing daylight.  I can see what de Lint is trying to do with the characters. veiling the extraordinary behind a veneer of ordinariness. Most everyone in the books has brown hair - this seems to be his concept of ordinary. But all the women are pretty and petit - because everyone knows fat bowsers never experience anything supernatural I guess. He's only a little more diverse with the males he portrays; they come off just faintly more realistic than his impossible women. The problem with his characters is not that they are not complex and interesting, its that the devices he uses to make them complex and interesting are so transparent and obvious. One can actually see his formulae for character creation laid out on the page like algebra, and it feels like being cheated.  De Lint flirts a lot with the themes of poverty and homelessness, but he writes it insincerely, romanticizing it shamelessly, and comes off like the proud bearer of white liberal guilt, rather than someone who's been there.  I think he wants his ghetto, the 'Tombs', to read like some bitterly cruel otherworld, but it comes off like a series of cardboard cutouts, a rough facade.  It was an interesting enough idea to set his stories in an invented Canadian town. One doesn't see it everyday. But try as he might he never quite manages to make the town seem real enough. And he just doesn't make Canada spooky enough.   Dreams Underfoot is a great idea that would have been better written by someone else 
 As a fan of westcoast rap, and a fan of KRS because he's on this, it kills me to give this 1 star. If you compare this to the Chronic, this album deserves -10 stars at least.The only track bearable to me is east coast/ west coast killers.All the other stracks probably would never make a Dr. Dre greatest hits. Seriously if you new to Dre and shady/aftermath, do not buy this, there is truly nothin on this album worth listenin' to twice 
 Crichton cobbles together a bunch of specious information from third-rate scientists to support the idea that climate warming is a hoax, and puts it all in the mouths of the most unbelievable characters to populate a novel in recent memory. The plot is laughable, the writing is sloppy, the dialogue is didactic. This is trash. Not even good trash. Too bad to see the author of Andromeda Strain sink so low. Shame on him 
 I bought this book since everyone was giving it 5 stars. The first part of the book was o.k., but then, it got into way too much detail. I found the descriptions of the cells, lymphs and technical names for every enzyme pretty boring. I had to make myself finish reading it. Buy it if you want to read every detail of the immune system. If you are like me and need something more basic, look on 
 I thought this book started very strong; it set up everything very well, and i could start to see the themes emerging from the work. But then the author decides to have these long-winded conversations with herself that are very hard to follow. She uses hyphens instead of quoation marks to represent dialogue. The major problem with this is she combines more hyphens when she breaks away from conversation to describe how the person is talking or to depict a scene taking place. Sometimes she doesn't even bother to start another paragraph when the dialogue starts back up again. So this results in a very confusing read as it's hard to tell if someone is talking, or if it's a scene, or could it be how they are talking, or is it an aside, or is it just a thought, or maybe this is a convo, and who is talking again, oh, maybe she is describing the surrondings....?   It drove me Crazy 
 just to make the plot work.  Not very realistic.  If you want a realist cop character, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. 
 I would recommend this for anyone interested in teaching Phonics. However, if you are interested helping children become proficient readers I would suggest you purchase Frank Smiths' "Understanding Reading".  
 Actually, I would give this "book" NO STARS, but there's no tab for that. Let's begin with the title to Chapter 29: "Who Needs N*ggers?". I asterisked that so it wouldn't get edited out - he of course spells it out. That should pretty much wrap up the essence of this fabulistic screed of pseudoscience, limp-wristed white racism, anti-semitism and a surprising anti-Christianity. This epistle to the mindless is at least written so that its target audience can read it: it is an endless series of single paragraphs. I am presuming this is so it can be read with one's finger pointing out each word, and thankfully for that same audience there aren't any big words, either.   If, as a previous "reviewer" said this is "the second greatest book ever written", obviously that Dick and Jane reader was the only other book they ever read - and slowly at that. What "white man's bible" seems to mean - not to give away anything important - is that the existing bible is too "polluted" with Jews. What a briliantly racist revelation! Or is that Revelation? The only other major criticism is that the paper is too stiff to replace that Sears catalog that's hanging in the outhouse.. 
 I have the same issues everyone else is having...except that ours seems to work pretty well outside (as long as you stay relatively close to the car).  However, as soon as I step inside our house, nothing.  Not sure if it is just a bunch of interference from satellite receivers, etc.  But we will be taking this back 
 This book tries to link together everything in Stephen King's books.  Sometimes it tries too hard.  Like finding a character name from one book simply mentioned in another.  Not too mind-blowing.  Some of the interconnections were intersting, but overall nothing to write home (or a book) about 
 Glam rock died for a reason. All these revivalist compilations need to stop being produced. - Thus says the Pellingto 
 This book is cliche ridden vitriolic feminist rant against the physics community. The author thinks that male physicists interested in the Theory Of Everything need "a major personality realignment". She thinks that universal suffrage is one of the primary forces that has shaped modern Western culture along with physics and parliamentary democracy. To support this she unconvincingly attempts to upgrade the role of women in physics with long boring sections about obscure women physicists. Did you know that Barbara McClintock's notions have revolutionized genetics or that Lovelock's Gaia theory was enabled by his female colleague? There are various insinuations of God, religion, and Christianity in various arguments through the book. The conclusion is that if we re-populate the physics community with a different type of male and a lot more women, including some with the force of religion in their lives then physics can focus on "different goals and dreams", not particles and forces. Bah! Don't waste your time and money on this one. 
 this book is very hard to understand for a student who knows nothing about geometry. it is an inductive approach which means that the author intended for the student to have to think about what to do for the next step in a specific lesson. it does not tell you what to do. only with a teacher of mathematics or geometry can a student understand geometry by using this book 
 The only reason I finished this book was it was a book club pick - I read a lot and it takes a really bad book for me to quit. This book is just never ending - no plot and a useless read. I can't believe so many people are giving it a good review. The constant narrative sounded like a neat way to write but it turned out very exhausting to read. Don't bother 
 I bought this for my 4 kids who love the frozen drinks. But, I soon found that it does not work well. After a few uses the gears began to stick. It would no longer crush/shave ice. Stick with the smaller units 
 The book should cost not more then $20 based on the information contained.  Much of the information is either watered down or appears in his first book.  Needless to say I was not impressed with the book 
 Benford is one of those writers who wax hot and cold.  He is acclaimed to be a science fiction writer's "scientist" in that he deals with a lot of "hard" science.  In this case, the result is pedantic and - the ultimate sin - boring.  The main character was not exciting nor interesting - just smart.  The great experiment and the result were so-so.  I kept waiting for something - ANYTHING - to happen but soon realized that this was it..a globe that was tested, studied and explored. I am reminded of the poem..."this is how the world ends - not with a bang but with a whimper.&quot 
 and he's a super-talented drummer. The day the Foos release a best-of compilation I'll probably pick it up. Otherwise, I'm sad to say that the average Foo Fighters album cut just doesn't cut it for me. All of the songs on THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE are mediocre, run-of-the mill "alternative" rock. Only "Stacked Actors" has some real songwriting substance and it does have some swagger and bite, but to be perfectly honest, it still isn't a huge turn-on in my book. "Learn to Fly," the other track that got some airplay on alt-rock radio, may as well have been written by The Outfield or some other average rock band along those lines. I almost gave this album two stars, but unfortunately I think that rating would be just too generous.  Foo Fighters HAVE made some really good songs, like "Everlong." But I honestly don't think they'd be nearly as big if Grohl hadn't drummed for one of the most highly revered and charismatic bands of all time, NIRVANA. Elsewhere, their fantastic cover versions such as Gary Numan's "Down in the Park" and Prince's "Darling Nikki" suggest they are great rockers but less great in the songwriting department 
 This coffee maker has a serious design flaw which causes it to make a mess when brewing 2 cups at once.  The problem occurs because one cup fills up more than the other cup, causing it to overflow coffee all over the appliance and the counter. Trust me..it was a mess.  At first I thought it was because the counter was uneven, so I got out the level and tried it again (with just water) on a table that was absolutely level. I tried running 5 brews, 3 of the 5 overflowed 1 of the cups. The other 2 times, one of the cups was filled to the absolute brim so I couldnt get the top on. The other cup was about 2/3rds filled.    Again...do NOT buy this item. Im sure you can find something similar that works 
 The good first. There is a lot of good. I enjoyed and agree with every chapter except the chapter about men keeping a visual rolodex of sexual images for their perusal.   My husband and I have a great marriage. He knows I have the utmost respect for him and he has great love for me. He is certainly not ever wanting more sex, just complaining about how he feel like a piece of meat sometimes. (In jest I'm sure.)I say that to show, that not coming from a prude, the author puts for the idea that men just lust and fantasize about women nonstop and it's normal. I am quite sure she used the word normal at least twice. It was dealt with like, it's a fact so get used to it.  Your man might chase women around home depot to get a better look, or go out to dinner with you and remain preoccupied with the hostess all night. The men give accounts of this, like, oh well, doesn't mean I don't love my wife.  In my opinion, just b/c they aren't willing to risk actually acting on those thoughts, doesn't mean it's ok.   I found the book to be very very discouraging. That a bunch of married Christian men would unapologetically (key word here)see a woman in a fitted worksuit no less (we're not talking lingerie here) and think about what she's like in bed or what her nipples look like. There's no mention that maybe this is lust or committing adultery in your heart. Or maybe they should not do this. It really threw me for a loop! I guess I didn't realize just how insecure or sex crazed men are. Not that I think they don't want a lot of it. But I found it discouraging for Christian wives to think that their husbands can't go to work without picturing everyone naked.  I found it disturbing that the book is purporting this is giving the idea to men a lisence to do this since it's "normal" and women just need to get used to the idea 
 This is an okay book if you already have several others and want another viewpoint. It should NOT be the only book you buy. There are too many errors and strong biases scattered throughout to make it a one-source reference. Freedom of the Hills (latest edition) is still a better resource if you're just going to have one. The Houston/Cosley book is more up to date and better researched. Twight's book is getting dated but still has good info for those who are pushing harder 
 I found that everytime I started getting to like the story it would stop or change subjects or switch gears without finishing the smaller plot or finish the plot very unsatisfactory. For instance the family that was running from the Baron and his men, it started out fine and then of course the rest of the Wiccan Army shows up and it ends. Some mumbo voodoo curse and the bad guy runs away. No one bothered to help the family or find out why they were running they were just forgotten. Well later they are caught stealing sheep but the point is there was no conclusion to the scene when it ended I was like "what just happened!". It misses the small points that make a world believable, most humans would have talked to the family and would offer them food or something or at the very least say the scouts could not find them. There was no humanity in the scene (which I thought it was going to show) just a chance for the Wiccan horde to throw a few curses around and forget the main point of the scene which was the family running from dogs.... Very bad stuff there in my opinion. I like the small things in scenes this one just made no sense.  Also leaving out important elements of the story. Such as when the Wiccan Witch is talking about who would stand against the Bad Guy in Portland she completely left out Mt Angel and the so-called warrior monks as an ally. Granted that is something small but it sticks with me when the story drops very interesting parts like the Monks. They sound interesting but are ignored, I guess being Christians is not worth writing about. Why are they ignored? Their premise is as I said an interesting one but they are left out except for a couple of pages.  There seem to be no faults in the utopian "good guys" world. There are no turn coats or spy or killers or rapist they are all perfect. Except for the one scene with the girl complaining about being seduced by the young A-Lister and getting with baby but that is not to show anything bad it is to show off Mike Bearkillers skills at being a leader to the English Chap. Of course he fixes the problem in 20 seconds and they walk off into the sunset and we never read about it again. The Characters are just too simple even the Heroes.   Although I like Mike his wife and the English trio they are interesting. Hordle is one of my favorites but I am left with an empty character in the end. Of course the English trio and Cpt. Nobbes went from the coast of Africa to Portland without any detail what so ever which made it look silly. As I said though the little things make a story for me even if it would have just been a small plot about getting around South America or did they cross the pacific ocean did they meet any more ships on their travel did they stop off anywhere to give background to the over all story? I don't know it just beamed them to Portland without an answer to just simple questions. Did they get the Prince to safety? I guess I am left to make up my own story.  The mind numbing wiccans are just that mind numbing. I can not say much about them because I just skipped over most of the irrelevant rituals and such and singing it annoyed me. We can not find out what happened to the Prince of Wales but we can read dozens of pages of wiccan rituals and silly plots. I have nothing against wicca I know nothing about it actually but if this is what it is then it is nothing I would want to know. That might sound harsh but really if the book is accurate it is silly to me, and I am not a Christian either really more agnostic I guess I know why now. I think the old Roman Gods would be more fitting, Mars and Jupiter, Gods of War and the blade and bow and stuff such as that. Just annoying to read all the mother earth stuff to be honest. I felt I was being fed religious propaganda half the time when reading about the disfunctional "Clans". Either they were either Lord of the Rings heroes or Druids I do not know really know which I could not read the nonsense.  But it is his story and I am free to read it or not and that is what it comes down too. Of course there are some huge gaps missing:  What happened to the US Army, Marine Corp, US Navy? For 60 years the US military has stockpiled food and gear for such a world and even without rifles and tanks would make them a incredibly powerful force. They just went poof? The Dark Lord in Portland would have been far better as some egotistical General carving out his own slice of the pie. Tacoma Washington is home to one of the largest US Army bases in the country yet they just died of starvation? Not to mention the numerous Naval Bases throughout the area. At least give an explanation such as you know they killed each other off or got VXed or something. Because to be honest I would rather have the kevlar body armor and helmet of the military then chain mail from 1400. But that is just me, not my story.   That is just one huge gap I kept asking about but never found an answer.  I love the premise of the story I just think it was badly presented. No offense to anyone that loves it 
 A dashing swashbuckler, Captain Alatriste, champions the cause of a young woman who has been forced into sexual slavery in a priest's home in the days of the Spanish Inquisition. At the heart of her trial is the issue of her heritage; she is of Hebrew descent. In the course of his struggle with the prejuidices holding not only an innocent girl captive, but a nation, the captain relives his own memories of the time he was a subject of the horrors and how afraid he was.   ** Though historically illuminating and shocking, the seesawing back and forth between memory and present narrative hampers the flow of the novel. However, if you have an interest in that period of history, this may not prove annoying to you. **   Amanda Killgor 
 They omitted the line from the movie version of this. It's where the alien tells the detective: "Your Mother Mates Out Of Season." It was so funny in the preview trailer of the movie that why they kept it out I don't know. I did check some of the shows out in this series, and they were just as bad if not worse than the movie as it was filled with plots that went nowhere, and the action was barely inept, and overall one of the worst movies of all times, and afterwards one of the worst t.v. shows. 
 This book started well in its flashback scene but like Berry's other books, it is just average.  All of his characters are stereotypes and his female characters (in nearly all his books) are all the same bitchy, arrogant, sexpots who need a man to rescue them.  The main female character in this book was about the most objectionable.  She is a high powered judge (so of course she has let the power go to her head and it has ruined her marriage to the likable attorney.)  However, after she is drugged, raped and saved by her ex husband she realizes she should give up her high powered career, go to work for her husband,and concentrate on being a wife and mother.  Wow -- the more-powerful-and successful-than her spouse is given what she had coming (a rape --which is just a man asserting his power over a woman) and then she all of a sudden realizes her place in the world.  Nice.  If this kind of characterization was an isolated incident in his books, I'd say, "Overlook it as bad writing" but since it is sort of the norm, I think Mr. Berry might need some professional help. BTW-- The virgin Mary comes off pretty good in The Third Secret so it isn't ALL his female characters, but any character less than the mother of God is characterized very badly.  
 I actually found the early part of the book dealing with the nuclear weapon okay -- not great like Cussler's books. Just okay. But there appeared to be a major change in style, going from a poor Cussler writing style to completely boring and pathetic. But I also had some sympathy for the American tycoon whose son had been killed by terrorists -- and he was the "bad guy" -- so I lost interest in finishing the book.  
 This book for undergraduate accounting classes at the junior level was more confusing to me than the comparable book by Kieso et al.  The sequence of the chapters is not entirely logical.  More advanced concepts seem to be covered towards the beginning whereas some basic chapters are discussed towards the end of the book.  It was especially confusing when not covering the chapter in chronological order - too bad that my class's syllabus was not outlined according to this book's chapter sequence.  In a different class - when we used Intermediate Accounting by Kieso - jumping back and forth was not a big problem.  This book by Spiceland also seemed to be very wordy.   Studying by solving problems at the end of the book seemed to work.  However, it is more important to know how your teacher designs the quizzes and exams and then study accordingly. On the CD that comes with it, there is a lot of ballast.  The quizzes are the only valuable thing, I felt.  There is not really a lot of use complaining about its weight - accounting books always seem to be extremely heavy and pricy. But this certainly holds true for this one as well!!!  When I tried to resell the book at the university bookstore, they would not take it back because it was selling badly on a national scale.  Very frustrating when you paid [$$$] just a couple of months earlier.. 
  I brought the DVD based on the core story line.  I love all werewolf movies hence it is extremely hard to make a werewolf movie I do not absolutely LOVE!  Full Eclipse manages to be a werewolf movie I absolutely hate with a passion.  I can handle lame sets, card-"bored" actors \ acting, bad special effects, cheesey looking werewolves, innane campy over the top dialogue almost anything.  Sometimes bad werewolf movies like Wolfen among others end up being incredibly funny which make me like them immensely despite their downfalls.  Full Eclipse is dull bad as anything I have ever seen and is not one bit funny at any point along the way.  Full Exclipse lame from start to blessed finish takes itself way way way too seriously to ever for a moment be the least bit funny.  Full Eclipse is trying desparately to be an action adventure flick but it never succeeds despite its many pathetic icreasingly lame attempts.  I never ended up liking any of the characters despite getting to know them.  Why these people did what they did was never fleshed out in ways that made me care about their mission.  Full Eclipse came across as a job for B actors and everyone dutifully showed up said their lines worked on the set, put a way lame BUT completed film in the can and promptly went home to gag in isolated shame at the things they did for money that day.  What I can not abide however is a movie that holds itself out to be a werewolf movie that tries unsuccessfully to be more than just a slash and burn horror fest.  In a low budget werewolf movie you don't need lots of intense background build up on the characters you just want to see liberial doses of blood, gore and entrails spead all over the place.  This movie spends way too much time slowly plodding along calling itself developing the characters.  I gave the DVD one star because it did such a bad job of developing the characters depsite almost the entire film wasted in the effort.  The real criminal in the making of Full Eclipse was the editor so much background stuff that should have ended up on the cutting room floor made the final cut into the film.  The pacing of the film was so slow it put me to sleep twice before I finally managed to see all of it.  Watching this werewolf flick was profound torture and I love most werewolf flicks.  The full blooded dude to werewolf conversion in this movie was on the best I have seen but even that could not save this movie.  Full Eclipse suffers from being BORING BEYOND ALL WORDS which is the one cardinal sin I will not forgive in a werewolf movie.  Given the chosen path this Werewolf movie had staked out, even I could have made a far more exciting satisfying movie than what was slapped together in Full Eclipse.  Full Eclipse is not bad HA HA is is bad... Snore Fest - ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ wake me up when it is over.  If I had a choice between watching this movie again and getting a root canal I'd be off to the dentist Office with a Big Toothy Wolflike grin with hugs for my dentist for his kindness.  Full Eclipse is painfully slow so bad that when my office has its annual DVD and Book Give away for charity I intend to offer Full Eclipse up for sacrafice.  Full Eclipse is so bad I honestly do not want it in my collection and I rather pride myself on having most werewolf movies.  Full Eclipse was so bad however it is one Werewolf movie I will brag about not having in my huge collection.  If I could give Full Eclipse a less than one star rating I would.  I have rarely been more disappointed by a werewolf movie.  Dog Soldiers among others is much better choice than this mess 
 Before I bought this book, I think this book is about the philosophical account on the scientific research.  After I bought this book, then what?  I was very disappointed, this book is just about the practical application of experimental design in scientific research.  Thus, the more apt title for this book is "Application of Experimental Design in Scientific Research" 
 Have to have it and use it to write a review, Don't you think; Sorr 
 I chose this book not because of its subject so much as because David Thomson wrote it. I own his "New Biographical Dictionary of Film" and have enjoyed reading the mostly thorough entries and catty comments it contains. "Nicole Kidman" is a tiresome and creepy disappointment, however. It is more filmography than biography and consists largely of Thomson's fantasies of how Kidman's films could be remade to better suit him, as well as a good deal of fretting about her "advancing age" (she will turn 40 this year) and the inexorable concomitant decline of her beauty, sex appeal, etc., which the author seems to take entirely for granted. I recommend this book only to diehard Kidman fans (a member of which I am not, although I have managed to see and enjoy most of her films anyhow, and think much of her work is just fine the way it is) who will read anything printed about her, no matter how bizarre or repugnant. Critics (and dirty old men) like Thomson should find someone more deserving of being picked on 
 This is exactly what I DONT like about KMFDM's new sound--I sure hope this is not the singer from MDFMK, because I liked that singer, but this chick sounds like that newer vocalist from Pigface--boo--thumbs down! 
 ...because that's how he makes his money and fame. Without it, he'd be known for what he ultimately is: a poor charlatan posing as a "scholar. 
 I like the idea that Michael Lewis wrote this book/article to defend a man whose coaching techniques are clearly out of style in todays world of my child this and my child that. Having said that I did not like this book:  1) the writing was chopping and hard to follow at times. i had to re-read many sentences to understand lewis' point.   2) the story lacked the depth of lewis' other wonderful books - where's the who/why/what that lewis used to moneyball (and others) educational - i wanted the story behind the story.   3) who were all the pictures of? i found them distracting...   i'll continue to read lewis' books bu thope the next one is bette 
 Buss must love to hear himself talk.  This is overstating the obvious to the n'th degree.  How many ways can you say that murder is related to human evolution and animalistic instincts?     There, actually, I just re-wrote the whole book in one sentence.  Don't bother...there's a reason there are so many of these for sale used, and very cheap 
 What is this person trying to prove? Most of this book was created on a racist bent, not very professional if you ask me. Shouldn't we be enjoying their gifts to mankind, instead of crying about something so petty and childish? Egypt was a melting pot, GET OVER IT! Besides, the race of these wonderfull people shouldn't matter. Quit befouling a glorious culture with modern day "politics." 
 This band claiming to be hopesfall is not! There is only one original member left, they should of changed their name with the release of atypes, no question. Atypes is a disgrace to the people who grew up with hopesfall in NC! I would have respected them if they changed their band name 
 Oh man, this sucks really bad. Good thing nu-metal is dead. THRASH METAL IS REAL METAL, this is for posers 
 Like many people, I bought this book to distinguish between a very entertaining movie, Amadeus, and the truth. I am a musician and am very interested in truly talented and practiced musicians wether they be current or of historically mythic proportions. The effort and research in this book is excellent but, unfortunately, it is full of psychology and psychoanalysis which I'm not particularly interested in. It may be more interesting if it was proven data but these analyses are little more than guesses by a writer. How do you get deep, deep into the head of someone from well over two centuries ago? I'm sure some of Solomon's conclusions are valid but I kept finding myself looking to see how much more of the book I had left to go so I could say I finished it and get onto something much more pleasurable 
 While I'm a big fan of Celine, this CD was a big disapointment. There are only two really good numbers on the CD while the other 13 range from fair to just plain bad.  On this CD it appears that Celine tried numbers that really aren't her style, and are "dangerous" to her voice. She is best when she does ballads and love songs.  A "Rock" or "Rap" star she is not 
 From the title. one would expect an in-depth review of the New York City PD, its officers and its problems.  What one gets is a ranting history of the NYC police from day one. Most of the book zeros in on a few unknown police officers who the authors tell us were the heros of their day.(Their day being 1850-1940)  The last few chapters bring us to "modern day NYC" and again-with the exceptional addressing of modern police problems (during the mid to late 1960's the NYPD experienced over 100 police officers killed in the line of duty-this book makes quick light of that)we are again rewarded with the tales of 2 more "unknown NYPD heros" that the authors force feed us.  In essence, this is a poorly written, totally uninteresting book devoid of any clinical insight into the modern day NYP 
 The basic problem is not just that Dr. Walford -- the 120 year diet guru -- died at 79.  The bigger problem is that he looked 90 when he died.  Now that is something hard to explain for the many fervent apologists from his sect.  And it is a sect.  Because otherwise you cannot explain their fervor, despite all the facts which would have stirred up some doubt in you or me.   Yes, Walford was a credible scientist who did some important research.  But in his ill-advised pose as anti-aging guru and in his books, he did himself a big disservice.  Because the truth is, caloric restriction works.  But Walford's regimen to practice caloric restriction did not an does not work.  It is unworkable.  It makes a difficult thing impossible.   And Walford looking 90 at his death was exhibit A of this irrefutable fact.  So buyer beware!  
 I would love to review it but I never received this product, therefore I will never purchase from AMAZON again!!! 
 I found the book mostly entertaining until the end. I was very disappointed by the convoluted story, and things were not explained very well at the end. I loved all her other books, but this one was horrible. I found it much more violent and disturbing than previous books, too. The stupid DID ending came out of nowhere and made no sense (maybe she has been watching too much One Life to Live). There were too many characters, too many plot threads, too many murders, and it was not tied together very well.  I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.  I sure hope her next one is better 
 This book, How the Other Half Lives by Jacob Riis, had several very distinct themes.  First, the life of immigrants to New York City in the late 1800s was deplorable while housing for others was splendid.  "To-day three fourths of its people live in the tenements, and the nineteenth century drift of the population to the cities is sending ever-increasing multitudes to crowd them" (Riis, p. 6) Sections of tenement houses were divided by streets and alleys which divided the nationalities.  "As emigration from east to west follows the latitude, so does the foreign influx in New York distribute itself along certain well-defined lines that waver and break only under the stronger pressure of a more gregarious race or the encroachments of inexorable business." (Riis, p. 21)  Each nationality had some very distinct characteristics but they also had some very great differences as well. 	The next theme to emerge was that of work.  In some sections of the city, it was acceptable for everyone to work while in other sections, only the men did physical work while the women "kept house" or there was even mention of the men just standing in doorways, streets and alleys.  "The men sit or stand in the streets, on trucks, or in the open doors of the saloons smoking black clay pipes, talking and gesticulating as if forever on the point of coming to blows." (Riis, p. 49)  Money was earned, at very small rates throughout the tenements, by someone in the family, if not multiple people.  "Often there are two, sometimes three, sets of sweaters on the job.  They work with the rest when they are not drumming up trade, driving their `hands' as they drive their machine, for all they are worth, and making a profit on their work, of course, though in most cases not nearly as extravagant a percentage, probably, as is often supposed.  If it resolves itself unto a margin of five or six cents, or even less, on a dozen pairs of boys' trousers, for instance, it is nevertheless enough to make the contractor with his thrifty instinct independent.  The workman growls, not at the hard labor or poor pay, but over the pennies another is coining out of his sweat, and on the first opportunity turns sweater himself, and takes his revenge by driving an even closer bargain than his rival tyrant, t his reducing his profits." (Riis, p 94) 	Finally, the third theme centered on bringing about change via real people, real stories and images of real life in the tenements.  "Riis made maximum use of photographs, however, not only to illustrate six of his books, but also as lantern slides to illustrate lectures he began giving in 1888 and continued until his death." (Riis, p. xvii)  People are drawn to real life situations to which they can relate.  The accounts, photographs and images of Riis bring real life accounts to the reader, sparking more interest, creating a deeper relationship between the characters in the story and the reader.  And by doing so, Riis encourages others to take action to remedy the sad situation.  	As the previous themes are analyzed, connections can be made between them and education and society of today.  It is important to first note that in today's society, there are still sections in certain towns and cities that are divided predominantly by ethnic diversity.  Not only is housing situations but also in educational systems the divisions are found, although it is encouraged that the lines be broken down.  "The many philanthropic efforts that have been made in the last few years to render less intolerable the lot of the tenants in the homes where many of them must continue to live, have undoubtedly had their effect in creating a disposition to accept better things, that will make plainer sailing for the future builders of model tenements.,  In many ways, as in the `College Settlement' of courageous girls, the Neighborhood Guilds, through the efforts of The King's Daughters, and numerous other schemes of practical mission work, the poor and the well-to-do have been brought closer together, in an every-day companionship that cannot but be productive of the best results, to the one who gives no less than tto the one who receives." (Riis, p. 207)  Obviously different locales call for difference measures of tolerance and defend certain levels of intolerance but the lines exist nonetheless.  "The experience of this landlord points directly to the remedy which the law failed to supply to the early reformers.  It has since been fully demonstrated that a competent agent on the premises, a man of the best and the highest stamp, who knows how to instruct and guide with a firm hand, is a prerequisite to the success of any reform tenement scheme." (Riis, p. 205) 	Secondly, work was important in this book. Riis did an excellent job of documenting the working conditions and who was responsible for certain jobs in the tenements in each section.  Just as Benjamin Franklin valued an honest day's work, so did the people of the tenements.  The biggest difference between those two accounts of work was who was actually responsible for the work.  Depending upon the culture of the area sometimes it was the men, women or children, or all three, that completed work to earn money or keep house.  "Men, women and children work together seven days in the week in these cheerless tenements to make a living for the family, from the break of day till far into the nights.  Often the wide is the original cigarmaker from the old home, the husband having adopted her trade here as a matter of necessity, because, knowing no word of English, he could get no other work." (Riis, p. 105)   But how did people in this situation become educated to work?  "The old question, what to do with the boy, assumes a new and serious phase in the tenements.  Under the best conditions found there, it is not easily answered.  In nine cases out of ten he would make an excellent mechanic, if trained early to work at a trade, for he is neither full nor slow, but the short-sighted despotism of the trades unions has practically closed that avenue to him.  Trade-schools, however excellent, cannot supply the opportunity thus denied him.  Home, the greatest factor of all in the training of the young, means nothing to him but a pigeon-hole in a coop along with so many other human animals.  Its influence is scarcely of the elevating kind, if it have any....With no steady hand to guide him, the boy takes naturally to idle ways." (Riis, p. 136)   	Finally, it is important to note the third theme of bringing reality into the lives of the reader.  In education today, it is important to show real life application of concepts and ideas for learning to take place.  Riis was a pioneer in bringing photographs, real images and valid data to people to create a felt need for change and response.  Most photographs in the book are very dark and only add realism to the stories told.  For example, the photographs on pages 93, 104 appear very dark and the subjects unhappy.  The fact that Riis was probably standing, himself, in the darkest part of the room and photographing the lightest part of the room, near the windows, only tells the reader that even in the lightest part of the room, the darkness and dreariness ruled over the tenements.  "Riis's use of photography to point his words and flesh out his anecdotes is no less important, endowing an entire legacy of its own." (Riis, p. xiii)   	I believe the intent of the author was to simply bring a big picture view to narrow minded people.  He very much accomplished his purpose.  By using stories of families, shocking details and everyday photographs of real people, he was able to bring people to understand the reality of life in their own city and encourage them to help make changes.  It is often said that a picture is worth a thousand words, and Riis is a prime example of this.  Not only are his accounts vivid and horrific, but also his images leave nothing to the imagination.  The reader can not be left to imagining a rosier picture than was intended.  The illustrations both verbal and nonverbal are graphic and moving. 	The appropriate audience for this book would have to be very broadly, mature, adult citizens of our world.  The language used in this book can be, at times, a bit complicated to comprehend; this is why I believe it appropriate for mature adults.  I also believe very firmly that adults are sometimes the most difficult to convince to take action to help those less fortunate or those in need.  When we read real life accounts and see pictures of people just like us in deplorable conditions, it is difficult for us to sit back and take no action.  I also believe it is important for citizens of our world to understand the underlying message of helping those less fortunate or those in need who may be right in our own back yard.  This book is a stunning example of one man giving factual accounts of events to produce concerned citizens ready to take action to improve conditions for fellow human beings.  
 Even though Amazon specifically recommended this bag for the Panasonic Lumix (DMC-FZ20PP) camera, and even though I had to return it because it was too small, and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer's review, Amazon annoyingly CONTINUES to recommend this bag for my camera. To add insult to injury, Amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault. (It took two emails to get the full refund, and that was even after I put a LARGE message in my return box not to deduct shipping -- aargh!)  Regarding the bag itself, construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point-and-click camera that requires no accesories 
 Being a fan of such authors as J.R.R. Tolkien, H.G. Wells, and C.S. Lewis, I figured I'd try and broaden my horizons by reading a book about the American West, a sort of historical fiction that might be entertaining. I did some research and Cormac McCarthy seemed to be the author to start with.  He got very good reviews (from this site and professional critics).  I find it amazing that he received such great reviews... this book failed to impress me in the slightest bit.  The book seemed to fly away from the plot for a while and suddenly, unexpectedly return to it.  I have never read a book like that before.  After completing this book I had found out more about the life of a prostitute than I ever wanted to know and also I received a free lesson in swearing.  I understand that it was custom in the West to swear, and dealings with prostitutes was common, but I think McCarthy went over the top.  This made it uninteresting and redundant.  Then there was the fact that he rarely used punctuation other than periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.  I did not see a single quotation mark and the word "and" was excessevely overused due to the exclusion of commas.  Dialogue was at times hard to follow and seemingly run-on sentences were monotonous.  After reading this book I also felt ignorant being uneducated in the Spanish language.  Much of the dialogue I could not understand in the least bit.  There were entire conversations written exclusively in Spanish at times when it seemed relevant.  I felt like I missed a lot of important information in the story. I did find that at time McCarthy did use some beautifully crafted language but the formerly mentioned factors left a very bad impression on me.  I don't suppose I'll ever read a book by Cormac McCarthy again 
 Despite the claim that both units take AA batteries, the unit we recieved takes 9V Batteries.  That is somewhat annoying because one of the reasons we bought this model was because of the AA battery usage as advertised.  Will review performance when we've had a chance to use it.   
 I can't believe the constant showboating of the writing in this book. The metaphors per paragraph (MPP) is just ridiculous and totally distracting from the story. Simile and metaphor are meant to communicate meaning. In this book, however, many of them, while sounding interesting or "peotic," simly don't do their real job, which is to help tell the story. Or maybe that's the problem - the story isn't very interesting so the author hopes to distract the reader from that fact with the spastic writing style. Bradbury here writes like a college kid whose only real chance of getting laid is by impressing some girl in his creative writing class. Really sad; I thought Bradbury was better that this. He apparently needed - and went without - a reasonable editor who certainly would have taken him out in the parking lot and slapped him around until he remembered what writing was supposed to sound like. Real writers use literary devices sparingly, if at all. And when they do, they make sure they are dead-on and impactful. Ray, read a little Carver or Hemingway before you write another next 70 pages of pap. If I sound irritated, I am. 
 As one of the reviewers noted in his review, I too have given many postive marks to those who have given five-star reviews for this novel; because some reviewers have made very good arguments in defense of this novel. [I never give negative marks on anything, even if I don't like a review, but I do give plenty of positives] Therefore, before you begin to throw the bricks and sling your arrows at me, please let me try and explain why I gave this book such low marks. First of all, I have tried to read--or at least decipher "Finnegans Wake" on four different occasions. I see from some of the reviews that anyone who attempts to disagree with this novels merits gets pelted with negative marks. For those of you who enjoy this novel, good for you! I do not profess to be as knowledgeable as some of you may be on this books merits. But I DO KNOW WHAT I LIKE! And I did not like this novel.  I first tried reading "Finnegans Wake" when I was in High School [it was not required reading] because I heard so much about it that I wanted to read something challenging. And challenging was an understatement. Realizing I was young, I attempted it much later while in the military. As if military life were not frustrating enough. It was not until I entered college, where I was reguired to read the novel, that I did so with true earnest: Due to the fact that I had to write an essay on the novel. I did receive an A minus on the paper. However, to be honest, this was after profusely littering the paper with as much b***s***, that to me Joyce littered his novel with. My professor must have seen some great merit in this essay---at least I felt so at the time.  However, wanting to truly understand the novel, I decided to REALLY try and capture what Joyce was trying to write. This too led to my dislike of the novel. Not so much with the books difficulty [although that was a problem], but with the simple question: Is it really worth reading? My answer? No! For me a novel has to give me that quality of enjoyment that makes the journey a delightful one. It has to capture my soul! This novel never did capture my soul. Give me unabridged editions [the only ones I read] of "The Count of Monte Cristo" by Dumas, "Les Miserables" by Hugo, "War and Peace" by Tolstoy [once is enough please] and more importantly, my favorite author, Dostoevsky, "Notes From the Underground," "Crime and Punishment,"  and "The Brothers Karamazov." These novels have given me something back in my life for the efforts that I put into reading them. They were profound and affected me deeply. They ALL gave me something in my life.   In conclusion, to those who find this novel worth the high praise it has garnered, I respectfully disagree. There are many great novels from which to choose to spend and evening, afternoon, or morning perusing. And while I do not look negatively on your opinions; if this book gives you enjoyment, then great for you. For me, however, the book gave me nothing. Nor do I wish to spend what little time we are alloted in our short life to spend it on this type of reading. That is my honest opinion. I am sure a 5 star review will give me many positive marks, but that is not why this review exists, or what I am about. This is just my honest opinion.   Today I am going to start reading two novels that I have been wanting to read for some time, but have put off until recently. "Growth of the Soil", by Knut Hamsun, and "The Master and Margarita," by Mikhail Bulgakov. I hear they are good novels; and after laboring over "Finnegans Wake" for too many hours in my life, I will begin to start on that reading list of mine. I'll let you know how these two novels work out. One thing I am pretty sure of, however, is that they will probably not frustrate me as much as "Finnegans Wake" did; and in fact, no other novel has been more of a disappointment to me than Joyce's so-called masterpiece 
 I cannot agree with previous reviewers that this cd is in the same class as "Blow By Blow" or "Wired". Sorry, Jeff, this is lame. Sometimes you just need to know when to hang up the axe 
 not the pumps described even though i tried everything else.  I found that taking whey protein isolate at 200grams per day worked better at giving me a pump during my workouts.  
 Considering the heavy processing power needed for the PC version, the graphics are not very impressive. The gameplay is boring, the AI is horrible, the only good thing about the game is the sound. You certainly don't get the feeling that your fighting in a jungle, more like the back woods of N. Carolina or something. Save your money. If you're looking for a good shooter get Far Cry, it's awsome. If you absolutely must have this game, give it a few months and it'll be $9.99 before you know it 
 This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one.  Besides, some of it is just plain wrong.  To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:  "In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general."    Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity.  He attributes to them, two "liberal" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with.  
 This is easily the WORST casebook I have ever owned. LOUSY for learning future interest and possessory estates. LOUSY for learning mortgages. LOUSY for learning adverse possession. Mainly lousy, lousy, lousy. Don't buy this book without purchasing a hell of a study aid b/c you won't learn jack from it since it's horribly written. Don't buy this book w/out purchasing a hell of a good pair of reading glasses b/c the print is practically microscopic. I can't believe I have to suffer through another property course w/this terrible book 
 I cannot imagine, being Shannon Tweeds and Gene Simmons children and picking up this book one day with the thoughts of maybe getting to know a different more in depth side of your mother. Most Biographies involve birth to the present and everything in between. I knew Shannon Tweed as an 80's movie D-Lister. She was basically in every single sitcom or drama back then as a guest star, or walk on. Her face is sort of recognizable, you might say "I know her from somewhere" but you can't place her.  She is beautiful, she is married to a rock star, and she of course is now in her own reality television show just like everyone else. This book, all 200 pages, lots of pictures, and large type is kind of pathetic. Not in a way that she herself is, but cmon, if you are going to write a "this is my story", spout some details, spill your emotions, give us something besides how you noticed your future husband was very aroused the first time you met him, and how many names you can drop. There are pictures of this woman, taken from playboy, that are full on nude Furry parts and all, I would be mortified if I was her children. There is a time and place for everything; a biography isn't one of them to show your naughty places. Tacky. I read this book, in ½ an hour, and I am not lying. It was that simple. Shannon, your shacking up with Gene Simmons, and your book is basically devoted to your boobs. 
 I tried to read this book, but could not finish it.  The book had an interesting message, but it was lost in the inaccuracies, broad sweeping statements, and linear logic.    His comments about Peak Oil were inaccurate.  There are plenty of books (1,000 Barrels a Second, for example) that address the issues accurately with much more thoughtful insight.      With regard to broad sweeping statements he makes comments like the southeast is prone to individuality and violence.  He failed to mention that when it comes to a sense of community and willingness to help their fellow man there is no better place to live then the southeast.  (For the record I am originally from the upper Midwest, but lived in the southeast for 7 years.)  Much of his prognostications about the future are linear, that is if a then b then c.  The author is in his late 50s and I would think by this time he would have figured out that life is a dynamic process that constantly adjusts to its environment.  If the cost of energy is too high people buy better gas mileage cars, drive less, close off portions of the house in the winter, don't use the air conditioner, purchase smaller homes, etc.  If the environment changes people constantly adjust including me, the author, and you.  What bothers me most about the book is that young people with less "life-experience" will read this book and believe this is the way it is going to be.  The author's book is just one more scenario of what could happen in the future.  But if life is a dynamic process, the constant adjustments to the environment makes it really hard to predict what will occur 
 This book is about Dave's late high school years, while he was in the foster care system.  This book talks about some friends that have helped him through some tough times.  I thought this book would talk more about his experiences and feelings about the foster care system, which we were initially led to believe.  But the book turned out to be more of a "guy" book, talking about his adventures and mishaps with his friends.  This might be interesting to teenage boys, but for a broader audience, this book didn't seem as interesting.  The experiences in foster care didn't really seem to come through as much.  The book seemed to ramble on and on about certain points and seemed to go off in a tangent at times.  As a result, the book became a little boring.  I also didn't care for some of the foul language in the book, which to me, often detracts from the point that the book is trying to get across.  About the review from the lady from New Zealand...it was not necessary to single me out in your review.  The point of these reviews is to review the book, not the reviewers.    Secondly, I did not like the book.  Plain and simple.  That is OK.  Not every book jives with everybody.  I don't feel that people who are grateful for the simple pleasures in life are boring.  I said that the book itself was boring and to me, it seemed to lose focus.  You do not have to agree with me, as I don't agree with you.  I am free to express my opinions on these books.  And yes, I read "Lost Boy", but the book initially led me to believe that it would have more in it about the foster care time period in Dave's life.  You see, I was in 3 foster homes as a kid, and to me, reading about foster care experiences from other people is always interesting to me.  So please, just focus your reviews on the books, not on the reviewers.  I had a legitimate opinion on the book and I expressed it.  I'm sure I'll lose helpful votes on what I've just said to "Gingerwoman", but it's important that we focus on reviewing books and not each other 
 due to a snafu with my computer, the first review i wrote for this book was lost.  i could have just given up, but i am determined to implore those of you considering adding this book to your library to please resist!  only because i had to choose a star rating did i give it a one star.  i would have chosen 0 star if given the choice.  though milton is obviously a talented writer and did much research for this project, she obviously has some kind of grudge against chaplin.  true, he unfortunately left a great deal to exploit with the scandals, both personal and political.  but what she so obviously neglected was his creative genius that earned him the title King of Comedy.  she emphasizes rumors as facts and takes it upon herself to tell us what chaplin was more than likely feeling or thinking about any particular subject, when there is no way she could assume.  for instance, in describing 'city lights,' a clear masterpiece, she completely distorts, in my opinion, the best movie ending EVER.  that look on the tramp's face as he looks at the girl he loves - his face so full of love, fear, hopefulness - it is unbelievably touching and beautiful, but milton insists that he is using it to manipulate his audience - hopeful he still has their devotion and fearing his hold on them has passed.  she portrays him to be an absolute monster.  clearly, he couldn't have been the easiest person to live with, but it gives her no right to drag him through the mud as she did.  i hate to think of the people out there just discovering the genius of charles chaplin - seeing her book and thinking it will be a good, truthful read.  start with the david robinson book, or jeffrey vance - they are much more honest and fair.  i keep my milton book only because i refuse to turn it over to a library or used book store to infect a future reader's mind.  
 I was not impressed at all with this video. The women who do the various facial exercies do not even smile and scared my son the first few times watching it.   It is poor quality, no originality and there is nothing I see that is going to help at all that I already do not do with my son.  
 I ordered the 7th edition as this page shows and incorrectly received the 5th edition. Problem was not corrected. 
 This is a wonderful idea, but is apparently before its time or the product designers didn't check with with the paper manufacturers.  It is easy to train the system to interpret bad handwriting, but accomplishing that, it is impossible to find replacement paper pads. The only replacement pads I have been able to find are steno pads and these don't have the same page/space productivity as the original paper which comes with the AceCad.  Either make replacement pads available or make the writing surface a different size to conform to writing pads that are more readily available 
 Ms.Steel is truly the Queen of repition. She needs to get some new editors and listen to them or unplug her word processeor. I see that is the ongoing critism of her books. I swore I was never going to read another of her soaps(I can't stand those either) but this given to me by friends that said it was sooo good.  I'll stick with the authours I know I like from now on. And I hope she finds some new descriptions to use besides impeccably and exquisite/exquisitely, she has worn these out. BUT she's laughing all the way to her banks and investment brokers 
 This book is one of the most difficult books I have ever read.  It seems to me that the author, Eleanor Duckworth, simply gathered a great deal of dreadfully boring, scientific information and put it in one pile.  For the most part, I feel like I had to read parts at least 3 times for it to make sense.  In all fairness, though, there are some good ideas in the book and that is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  The title is very much misleading, in my opinion.  It should have been called something like - "A CATALOGUE OF WHAT SOMEONE ELSE THOUGHT WAS WONDERFUL IDEAS".  Good luck to all who attempt this one - know in advance what you are getting into and it might not be so bad 
 This book is unorganized, out-of-date, too focused on New York City, and on every other page promotes the authors and their careers...On page 7 they are telling you how much has changed with the computer age, and the internet, and one of the authors tells you he went to grade school and they used quill pens and fountain jars...okay, I didn't need to know that.  It was so annoying that by page 14, I was going to submit to them a list of improvements, but it would have been EXTENSIVE!  From there on just gritted my teeth and got through it...Good luck!  You'll be really tired of the references to the Trade City Bombing, and NYC in general, by the end of it 
 I just began this book and I'm sure I'm premature in writing a review but I feel I must get the truth about this book out immediately.  This books is written strongly from a Church of the Latter-day Saints (LDS) slant.  Many of the quotations come from LDS "prophets" which is more than troubling to me as a Christian woman.  I'm trying to overlook this and gleen some help from book but it's difficult.  How can Amazon write a description and not mention this book has a strong religious slant?  Ugh!  I wasn't interested in getting indoctinated by another faith -- just improving my relationship with my husband.  BE CAREFUL 
 After reading the great reviews, I was really looking forward to using this small clock radio in my bathroom.  I guess the reception was ok but I was very disappointed in the sound quality.  I have a couple of inexpensive, small portable radios with much better sound but I was looking for a radio with a clock as well.  I am returning the radio 
 I am rather picky, but liked not only the look of these earrings on the webpage, but also the name.  They were not what I was expecting when they arrived.  They are okay, but not nearly what I thought they would be.  They are not very sea opal-ish -- they look too glassy and transparent.  The silver is also okay, but could be better.  I would not recommend. 
 I thought Weston's book was a little too short when I first picked it up. Turns out I should have relied on my instincts.  While I believe Weston does a fair job introducing readers to the concept of arguing, he fails terribly overall. Basically, any student that took Math in high school that involved "proofs" would know Weston's entire book.   The only thing I really enjoyed was the index on "cheating."  Don't get this book if you have ever taken anything involving mathematical proofs or philosophy. Otherwise, knock yourself out 
 This shonky production gives a new dimension to the term 'exploitation'. The DVD cover lists the running time as 85 minutes. It isn't. The total running time of the disc is 73 mins. To compound the deceit the running time of the story, such as it is, is a mere 59 mins. The balance of the time is taken up with a 14 min credit crawl. That's longer than the credit crawls for Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments combined. It's painfully slow and is plainly done for the sole purpose of padding out the disc. Don't waste your time looking for the director's commentary and Behind The Scenes mentioned on the cover. They're nowhere to be found. A complete disgrace 
 The plot in Final Analysis is trite and overused and the characters are flat and stock. Tedious and painful to read 
 This is the first DS book that I have read in about 20 years & it made me realize why did I try again???????  Can I really find a book centered around a 70 year old male stud-muffin real?  I wonder to myself if anyone has ever portrayed a 70 year old female stud muffin? I would hope as we age we would like to be portrayed with a bit more substance.    Coop only dates 20 something's.  He has a 20 something porn star black-mailing him that she is pregnant with his child.  This doesn't bother his new girlfriend, an (early 30's) resident Pediatrician, who works in ICU with preemies at all, who tells him to "have her get an abortion".  A bit too blasï¿½ for me.  Coop is supposed to be unbelievable beautiful & sexy.  I had a hard time getting into this premise.    The way DS totally changes his character toward the end is unbelievable.  Everyone falls in love all of the sudden with the other characters.  Every character is, of course, extremely wealthy (even though several are hiding it). Most characters are extremely beautiful & look many years younger than they are.  I realize we read to escape but this was a bit too much even for DS.   
 I unfortunately wound up seeing this Christmas Misgiving on its original airing.  I have always been a fan of any Christmas special since Rudolph hit the air way back when. Each holiday season I hope for something to come along that has the potential to become the "New Rudolph".  This is so far away from that you would need the Hubble Space scope in order to see how close it came.  The imaging is excellent and has been executed with great expertise. Regrettably the story makes Santa vs. the Martins look like an Oscar contender.  Such a waste trying to make it more desirable by hoking it up with 3D gimmickry.  You can't improve on failure. After it aired on TV I didn't see it return in later years on regular TV. I didn't miss it then and was hoping to extend the pleasure indefinitely.  Can't win them all 
 The animation was cool, but the storyline lacked a whole lot of substance. This movie needs a lot more background information for it to be interesting. Also, remember the speeder chase through the forest in Star  Wars: Return of the Jedi? Well, expect to hear those very sound bytes for  the alien fighters in this movie.. 
 I purchased this to use on the desk chair in my office at work. I was basically interested in the heat feature.  The heat and massage turn off after 15 minutes. This is described as a safety precaution but it is highly annoying to have to re-set everything every 15 minutes. j 
 The album does not live up to the "hype". It's the kind of album you buy on vacation then go home, put it in your cd rack and never pull it out again. Don't get me wrong, it isn't bad; in fact the musicianship is very, very good. But unique it isn't 
 I have found my old edition of the dictionary less than satisfactory.  It accepts pronounciations such as "nucular" as "nonstand" simply because it is used by some not too literate politicians.   A dictionary that elevates ignorance to "nonstand" is, in my opinion, not trustworthy.  Perhaps the newest edition is more reliable 
 Do not buy this book! Why, you ask? This is a quote from chapter 15, p.212: "In TV advertising, the manufacturers can get name publicity in two ways if they desire, namely, by flashing the product name in big print on the screen and by having the name frequently repeated by the announcer" (!). Now, you're probably wondering why I'm giving a quote from *PAGE 212!*. Well, that's because I forced myself to read this because it was written by some legendary ad guy. But don't make the same error as I did. Please buy Ogilvy on Advertising, Cutting Edge Adverting, Creative Advertising and Hey Whipple instead. Yes, all of them instead of Tested Advertising Methods. You won't be disappointed. Or your money back (just kidding) 
 Let me put it bluntly: my instructor uses this book as little as possible due to the incredibly overdone style in which the text and problems are written. Calculus is difficult enough as it is, but this book makes it virtually impossible to comprehend. User un-friendly. Petition your math department to choose another text.  
 Just finished this read and I am still wondering why.  It started out well enough; the story idea was original and interesting, but I should have figured it out when the "Indiana Jones stuff" started. The writing FOR THESE EXCITING PARTS WERE BIT OVERDONE!!!!  And then we are back to normal again, NO WAIT!  SOMETHING EVEN MORE EXCITING AND LESS PROBABLE IS HAPPENING NOW!!!!  Anyhow, I felt my 8th grader could have probably written this book.  So I had nothing more to read and I continued.  I should have stopped, because as you know if you have read the other reviews... the Davinci Code junk started.  What a load!  Jesus is now gay?  Couldn't come up with a variation of those gnostic views huh?  So lets make some stuff up and cause a controversy so we can sell books.  I really hate to tell you Mr. Reilly but thats not a new idea either. Very low quality read, in other words don't waste the time reading this when you can watch paint dry, water boil, or even watch a cake bake.  And if you are a late night reader as I am you would be better off going to sleep 
 I can't believe how many people rave about this book. I just finished it today and it was probably one of the most shallow, superficial books I have read in a very long time. New York women all acting like spoiled little girls, the whole story reminds me of the Barbie phenomenon. It they were to make a movie out of this book, they should use all the Barbie characters and let's nor forget about Ken! Such a waste of time 
 This product is not even directionally accurate.  It said that my body fat percentage was 10% higher than actual.  Then my fit brother tried it and it said that he had 25% body fat.  Perhaps we had a lemon, but I am taking this back because it is very inaccurate.  In fact, this is the first review I have ever written because I want to warn people about this product.  Please do not waste your money 
 An elf appearing to Harry Potter warned him not to return for a second year to the school of sorcery. The Chamber of Secrets, he said, had been opened and a  monster is lurking. Harry goes anyway and is the only one who can hear the monster, challenge it and save students who have been "petrified" by the monster. Age group interest: early teen. I wanted to see what all the rave was about. Lots of action, not much morale.  Trish New, author of The Thrill of Hope, South State Street Journal 
 Sorry guys, This album is really horrible.  It just reflects her musical career as mediocare and poor choices in who honored her.  Everytime I see her on television, she comes of as arrogant.  It is hard to pull off a tribute album when someone is covering songs of an artist who did "cover songs".  I will give her the props that she had a sucessful television show and one big hit "Country when country wasn't cool"(Reba version was akward) but her career does not merit much from music critics 
 this book never arrived. i emailed the seller several times but never received any response. i had to complain to amazon before they would respond, and then they only responded to amazon.   i would NEVER do business with this company. 
 The history of the making of the Nancy Drew books is fascinating, and I did enjoy reading that part of this book. However, the author simply could not keep her point of view (that the Nancy Drew authors and creators were modern feminists, showing the great big male world what women could do back then) when the facts simply did not support this point of view. The author even says that the writers SAY they didn't think they were being pioneering or feminists, yet, the author tells, us, even though they say there weren't, they are, and Rehak insists on it. I can't understand how an editor could have allowed so much bias to enter into this book unless the editor, too, shared this slanted point of view.  So, read this book for the history, that part is fascinating. But take all the feminism with a grain of salt. Mildred Wirt Benson is a fasincinating lady, but her intention with Nancy Drew was simply to write a great story and earn a living. She was not trying to impress any men or show the male world that women rule, as the author seems to imply 
 J.K. Rowling successfully put me off this book series within the first two chapters of this book.  The characters personalities were wavering in book 5, in this they completely vanished or mutated.  I'll only be getting the 7th one because it's the last one and I've read this far so I might as well go the whole way.   In books one through four the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione were loveable characters tenaciously and cleverly seeking out the answers to the mysteries that came up each year and saving the day.  Book 5 had them doing more angsting and screaming than mystery solving, and more whining than day saving. Book 6 made them stand in paper doll doing a bad job miming the motions the real characters would have done.  This book Harry seemed to care more about romance.  A very poorly done romance littered with cheezy phrases and romantic moments on par with the worst of bad fanfiction; which had no background or build up from previous books.  A female character from the background, whom Harry barely even notices all through the past five books, is suddenly the most perfect and beautiful girl in the school in mary-sue fashion.  Several other characters in both the foreground and background were also unfortunately treated to Rowlings amature attempts at romance, none of which bore any revelance to plot or story.  Harry also had a significant decline in morality and intelligence.  The clever boy who put clues together with his friends now cheats in one of his classes and makes one stupid mistake after another.  The image of Harry that stuck with me and seemed to glare off the pages every time he spoke or did anything was of him lying, frozen in a curled position on the floor of the train with blood coming out of his broken nose, under his invisibility cloak and rolling around with the trains motion after a particularly stupid episode with Malfoy.  As to the general plot of the book.  Poorly done.  Continually backstaged by sickeningly done romance and angst it barely made an impression on me.  Most of the 'revealations' in the book revealed nothing not already known or obvious from old information, and the culmination of what Harry was not-quite-solving didn't amount to anything.  My final opinion: Don't bother to read past book 4 if you're just starting the series and care anything at all about characterization.  A very disappointing book 
 My wife and I have now spent a good month "learning" with this book. In fact more than 10 minutes a day,  more like 30 minutes per session. We both speak other languages, so we can compare.  GOOD, nice thematic picture groups,  and you need to learn the words associated with them.  (We did.)  BAD, again, and again Ms. Kershul introduces words,  and grammar which do not fit into the "just mastered"  scheme of things.  IRRITATING to the extreme: Ms. Kershul gives her instructions in a mixture of English  and Italian in one sentence.  (We would have preferred one line of Italian ONLY,  followed by one line --say in italics--  providing the English translation, in many cases preferably, with an explanations "how this compares to what was done yesterday".)  BAD: In attempt to NOT introduce grammar, you are left high  and dry figuring out gender, declinations, and worse conjugations by yourself.  (We have not yet seen satisfactory forms summarizing 'things',  and we are half way through the book).  In anger, we finally went to the local library  and got a 70 years old Italian grammar for High Schools.  That did solve our problem and left us convinced that "new and improved" does not necessarily  provide a better learning experience.  Somewhat IRRITATING:  Ms Kershuls's choice of vocabulary seems to assume that 1. you wish to visit lots of relatives  (not an uncle, niece, grandson, cousin, grandparent, or daughter  is forgotten in the family tree),  2. you wish to order meals and "buy stuff" constantly (we assure you, that is the one thing Italians are very good at, understanding English when you want to  buy things or order a meal)  3. you wish to tell Italians that you are "American"  (as if our accents and clothing are not dead-give-aways)  4. you pray "catholic", "protestant", or "Hebrew".  (the Italians we know couldn't care less -- how about instead "politics", "music", "movies", "soccer"  and the "bella ragazza" over there)  In summary, we are ready now to look for a book which does not claim to be "easy, in 10 minutes a day",  but emphasizes grammar,  groups vocabulary (and discusses alternatives for each new word),   provides clearer indication of emphasis in the pronounciation (example: telEfono, versus incorrect tElefono) Teaches Italian as a language of "constructed" full sentences, rather than "single catch words". ------------------  Our final test,  No, we would not recommend this book to a friend 
 I couldn't be more disappointed and couldn't have been more bored.  I'm so glad I'm finally finished this novel. Now I can get on to something worth my time. I really, really hated it 
 I wish I had known this pamphlet (definitely not a book) was only 15 very sparse pages long because I would not have ordered it.  The word descriptions of actions to be taken are very hard to understand with no sketches or photos.  It seems more like  a book review or outline of a book that is yet to be written 
 I have a bad record of choosing books from the Airport Bookstores. I have made some really attrocious choices. This one is not that bad, but I could not recommend it to anyone. If I would have read the inside flap I would have realised that Michael White was the "Science Editor of British GQ Magazine" --- I did not know that anyone who read GQ would be even interested in Science, but if they are, there taste would be light to the point of idiocy, like this book.   The title is inane enough. It lured me in like a sucker... I was interested in reading the counterpoint of what would be two personalities --- the Pope and Bruno. But the Pope does not even really appear in the book.  The main problem is twofold:  1) Lack of any discernable organisation. The book is a mess. It is hard to put together any discernable record of the like of Bruno after I read this --- was he in Frankfurt first and then Paris? Maybe it was the other way around?   This means that White mixes everything up, chronology, main themes and the roles of people in the book. Ideas are not at all well developed. There is a sometimes peurile feeling about his writing style: when an idea is developed a little he switches to other things --- one feels that he is writing at times for the attention span of a 12- yr-old reader.  2) Weak development of themes inside the book. Scholastic ossification of the ideas of the Catholic Church is a great topic, but White's starts with a description of how Aristotle was always wrong on everything... and vaguely brushes him off as an almost personal hindrance to development of ideas. Such comic-book interpretations really show a lack of mastery of his subject.  White intimates a tremendous importance for the hermetic tradition, although he keeps this significantly nebulous (something that a reader of GQ or Omni might be interested in). As usual his work verges towards veneration for mysticism.   At the end of the day he should have marshalled his forces with more discipline and spent the time on making this into a serious work that it should be, and as Bruno deserves. It appears that he merely cranked this one out. He will pay for this as readers such as I will never buy another of his books.   Back to the Thompson Twins Mr. White!    
 Inspector: Deux Deux, we place loser gangsta rapper Juvenile under arrest. Deux-Deux: What are the charges Inspector. Inspector: First, he trashed our President and FEMA on Get Your Hustle On. Deux-Deux: That is treason. Inspector: Rodeo and the rest of this album degrades women(Rodeo), glorifies violence and praises chronic and looting! Deux-Deux: In addition, he advocates domestic violence, robbery, murder and illegal substances. Inspector: Finally, he degraded his own fans at a record launch party by a)telling a girl at his album release party that "he didn't give a f--k about her and none of ya'll b*tch*s and just want you to support my music and buy it" showing he is a greedy money hungry thug, b) this loser got into a confrontation with a female at the club exposing him for being an insensitive hypocrite and finally got into a fistfight with a white DJ. Deux-Deux: Proves he is a bonafide racist(like Kanye West) with a very nasty and abusive attitude. If you want rap, buy Run-DMC or The Fat Boys 
 Some of the absolute worst, most pretentious, emptiest, and most ultimately worthless drivel I have ever read. Jorge Luis Borges, regardless of all the idolatry that's been heaped upon him, had a surprising number of misses, and maybe nothing much to say. But I'll grant that he had a few high spots. Not this guy. Very derivative and disappointing stuff...I'll go elsewhere for literary thrills 
 Black and Blue is the story of a woman who flees an abusive relationship, taking her son and attempting to disappear into residential Florida, all the while waiting for her husband, a New York cop, to find and hurt her. The book is not Quindlen's best and while it is readable, and at less than 400 pages a manageable length, it feels like little more than a Lifetime "woman's" movie in novel form. I wouldn't recommend this book, especially in comparison to Quindlen's other work, although the lessons of what abuse is, how it happens, and how difficult it can be to escape are good ones to learn about, even in a fictional context.  Anna Quindlen is also the author of One True Thing, a book-cum-film about a daughter's experience with her mother's terminal cancer. That book is good--realistic, emotional but not maudlin, and challenging. Black and Blue is merely an example of weak writing that reads like a made-for-TV movie. It made its way into Oprah's book club but would never make it on to  my must-read lists. Facing the realities of abuse is a good lesson to learn, and so the subject is worth reading about, but Quindlen's portrayal is less than realistic or compelling. All of the checklist facts are there: abuse leads to abuse, specifically carried from father to son; some women are drawn to the type of men that are/become abusers; legal protection can be inadequate; violence can lead to death. So on, so forth. The list of facts is there but the emotional context is filmsy, centers on children (rather than personal strength) and strange, powerless situations. Even when she flees her husband, things seem to be done to the protagonist rather than done by her. It's unfulfilling and disappointing to the reader and detracts from the whole text. In fact, the more interesting characters are mere foils and supporting roles like her new friends and romantic interest. They seem to have more personality and depth than the protagonist.  It will take less time and energy, and induce the same emotional responce, to watch any one of the numerous women's TV daytime movies about the same subject. Black and Blue is gripping only because you want to know if her husband will find her or not, and presents very few challenges, either in the writing or the ideas, to the reader. It's readable and I was able to get through it, but it's still a poor example of literature and even of the lesson it attempts to teach. Don't waste your time on this one 
 I bought this item for my son's piano practice. It worked ok in terms of sound and speed, until the second day when the on/off switch broke off. Then I noticed that the plastic attachment the switch had was very thin to start with. In my opinion, this is a flaky product since the on/off switch will be used many times every day and so it has to be sturdy.  
 There is no reason to inflict this text on yourself. If you are looking for a primer, or at least a solid piercing of the semiological membrane, there are far superior works, such as the wonderful Semiology: The Basics by Daniel Chandler or Structural Poetics by Culler. This book, it seems to me, was meant as a fast and loose refrence for a class or a seminar: it rarely defines its terms, it seems disorganized and it is very dry, just listing method without any reason why one should be interested. The other two books, in particular Basics, were written long after Elements and thus are much more incompassing, including theory and practice, and Basics by Chandler even has a glossary at the back. Bartes may be the man, but this is definitly not the book; but, if your a Bartes completist, already well initiated into the world of Semiology and Structuralism, then by all means pick it up. Anyone else, steer clear 
 I can't begin to convey the frustration I felt when trying to use the refill.  I struggled for 20 minutes trying to slip the too-tight bag over the cartridge.  The Diaper Dekor works wonderfully as a single-use item, but at about $30-40 a pop, it is the most expensive garbage can outside of Ted Kozolowski's apartment.  The printed instructions were clear-- it's just that they product does not do what it supposed to do 
  I did not like this book at all. It states to wait for the puppy to do the wanted action and praise the puppy. That to me does not seem like the way to train a puppy. I have ordered the dog whisperer video and am hoping for better results 
 The authour of this book seems to think that the only single females around are prosperous, white, and urban. The vast majority of single women raising kids do not fit this mold and are certainly worse off for not having a strong father figure in their life. A more apt title would be "How Lesbians and Feminists can Brainwash Chldren into Thinking Fathers are not Important".  I could not imagine how my life would have turned out without all the wonderful strong male role models in my family that were there to correct my wrongs and provid support when it was needed.  Single mothers can raise quality children if the situation dictats but why would you choose to exclude someone so important to a child's development.   Feminists started by toting equal rights, and they triumphed as they rightly should have. Now their agendas push for the abolition of the strong nuclear family and castration of the male youth in this country.  You wonder why American society is breaking down?      
 The plot is confussing and weakly held together by the detailed personal stories. I found little that was morally redeeming or outstanding in this book. Having grown-up in Oklahoma, I found the book unauthentic. I cannot recommend this book 
 The intercooler can, and in my case did, damage my 360. It sucks current that otherwise would go to the 360, which caused component failure. The worst part? As it's not an approved accessory for the 360, any damage it causes will void your warranty and you'll have to buy a new 360 out of pocket 
 Can't give a review on Maximum PC.  Never received the magazine.  Instead I was sent the men's magazine FHM.  Please send my Maximum PC 
 Don't even consider watching this movie, if you already read the book and are hoping for a decent adaption to screen. This movie is more interested in showing us body parts than a good plot that moves and flows well.  Sean Connery and Wesley Snipes do nothing to brighten the outlook or dialogue of this movie, and Steve Buscemie's role is way to short to be any help in saving the torn threads of this really awful movie. Besides being, this movie doesn't inform us why the murdered girl is playing such a big important role in the film, only that men seem to enjoy her, and who was the killer. The negotiations are never really explained also, we only know they are importent to the Japanese, and the American's are a bit wary in agreeing.  If you're looking for a good Micheal Crichton movie, try Jurassic Park 1-3 or the thirteent Warrior. For all thats good and wonderful, don't, I beg you, bother with this boring, drawnout attempt at the real thing 
 I got this book nearly a decade ago, and valued it a lot at the time. I hadn't seriously used it in quite some time, then, while reviewing some books I had just read, decided to post one about it.  When I got online, I first noticed the comments in the line of "It's too bad that 'Composer X' gets omitted."  But, this is a book about music, I was thinking, and "de gustibus non disputandum" will always be the rule in the arts.  Then, I started looking through my current collection of nearly 500 classical CDs and said, "Whooah, there."  First, Steinberg appears to operate with a narrow definition of what is a symphony, perhaps. Why else is Rachmaninov's "Symphonic Dances" omitted, for example? Or Hindemith's "Four Temperaments" or "Symphonic Variations"?  On symphonies themselves, where is Stravinsky's "Symphony of Psalms"? Or anything by Schnittke, the best symphonist of the last third of the 20th century? Or Malcolm Arnold? Or Nicolai Myaskovsky, a great contemporary of Prokofiev? Or Ernst Krenek? Or Szymanowski? Or Hovhaness, as "pop" as he may be to some?  And why so much Haydn?  In other words -- and this is why Steinberg's book started falling like a rock for me -- his "playlist" is quite conservative. I don't think either Boston or San Francisco (he served as orchestra program annotator in both places) are that conservative musically, so why is he?  I mean, someone could do a separate volume just out of all the 20th century composers he omitted.  As my title notes, this is an in-depth book for what it covers, but it fails in what could have been a great didactive exercise. I moved my classical music boundaries beyond 1900 through dint of my own open-mindedness, but sure would have loved the help of a book like Steinberg's that analyzed more 20th century symphonic works.  If your "playlist" is stuck where many heartland American classical listeners' may be, then this book could be just for you. But, if you want to learn a lot about modern symphonies, skip it 
 There is no way that a person not in some way connected to the promotional department of Talib's record company can listen to this "MiX-tape" (read: inferior/1/2-as* release) and honestly claim that it is better than "Quality" or "Reflection Eternal" or even "Beautiful Struggle."  It's just not.  And as for his lyrics, as great as he has been in the past, I have to say he's coasting on this one (just because you leave out drugs and guns doesn't mean that the topics you use necessarily happen to be interesting or good).  I don't even particularly care for the Lauryn Hill song: "you got skills, you uplift the hill".  No wonder he didn't include a lyric sheet!  Besides that you have mostly 'cheerleading' type songs paying lip-service to the 'movement' or 'struggle' with lots of repetition and yo's, etc. and (can I say it?) way too much "Jesus", not nearly enough real provacative rhymes.  In total: you play this tape completely through 2 times and you realize it was just a pay-check for Talib.  It's not nearly as good as say when Jay-Z or 50 Cent decide to be commercial and make some dough.  Not NEARLY.  So as underground, it fails, AND as so-called 'mainstream' radio-invasion, it also fails. WORSE.  Maybe I feel so burned because I now realize that I should have bought the Coup's new one instead.  And...where did that tape by 50 go?  Talib's lucky this joint wasn't dropped a couple of years ago.  He might have ended up name-checked on 'Window Shopper' too 
 In the introduction the author states that feminism is the most important discourse of the 20th century.  He recites feminist dogma about men as if it were unquestioned fact, "sustaining unequal material advantage, opportunity, status, and privilege," p-3.  I'm sorry, but I don't believe that feminism and feminist women have any more valid things to contribute to an understanding of men and masculinity than the National Socialists contributed to our understanding of Jews.    The rest of the book continues to be a compilation of feminist men bashing couched in scholarly language.  For example, in essay 8, Naming Men as Men, the author starts out by claiming that many writers use "men" in the titles of their books but actually don't interview men in the text.  The author of this statement then cites feminist women to support his theory.  Much of this essay, like the others, is devoted to women and how men are now supposed to adjust to whatever women want.  In conclusion the authors says that "this chapter has sought ... to identify the gendered nature of power and power relations in contemporary organizations. In other words, it has repeated feminist dogma about men and power.    One flaw that is pervasive is reliance on feminist writers as authorities on men, p-147 for example.  The book is supposed to be about men and masculinitites.  Why do they think that females have any clue about men and masculinity?  Do the authors review men and masculist literature?  Not so you would notice.  In addition, the feminist concept of "the patriarchy" is continually given credence as an accepted standard rather than recognizing it as misandrist propaganda.  A more reasonable approach to understanding men would be to forget the prevalent feminist theories and to start looking at men.    Use of the concept of "the patriarchy" throughout this book is a dead giveaway at it's intent and focus.  As Sam Keen says in "Fire in the Belly, on Being a Man," P-196, "Perhaps the best rule of thumb to use in detecting ideological feminism is to pay close attention to the ideas, moral sentiments, arguments, and mythic history that cluster around the notion of "patriarchy."  "Patriarchy" is the devil term, the code word for the evil empire of men, the masculine conspiracy that has dominated human history since the time of the fall."  In The Masculine Reader, "the patriarchy" is probably the most commonly used word and concept. Anyone wanting to learn about men and masculinity would be far better off reading Sam Keen.   A serious discourse on men and masculinity is badly needed.  Unfortunately this book is very wide of the mark.  You can't learn about men by reading and believing the misandrist theories of anti-men feminism.  A better book real understanding of men is a serious need.   
 On balance, this book provides a good overview of the subject and of recent academic studies.  However, it is often theoretical and "ivory-towerish."  There is relatively little that really instructs the reader about transactions are actually done.  A great deal of time is devoted to discussing why they occur, but little practical insight is provided as to the challenges and issues that must be resolved.  This book may be suitable for someone who is curious and interested in reading about M&A but provides little guidance for those interested in learning how to undertake transactions 
 i think this might be good starting point for learning access but there are probably better books out there. a lot of the examples are like "click on this" "type that" without really explaining to you what you are doing or what the other options that are available would do. so you are learning how to do one thing but the menu you chose itfrom has 9 other things you can do that arent explained, so if you were learning access and applying it to something at work if what you were doing didnt match exactly what you did in the book you would still do a lot of guessing or you would need another book. the end of chapter exercises also are either too vague or too step by step (making you feel like you are doing anything other than painting by numbers rather than learning)and there are no "answers" and not even a lot of pictures of what you should end up with, so for all you know you did it all wrong.  this book and cd gets you comfortable access but just seems to basic for me for anyone other than someone who barely uses a compute 
 This book is so flawed in every which way, it is hard to know where to begin. First of all, we are living in the end times, and when Jesus comes, that's all she wrote, folks. There's no seven years, no Christians being zapped up, etc. This is our Second Chance on Earth. No tribulation. This book takes figurative visions and tries to apply it literally, and does it poorly. Reading this book made me think that if this was true, then what's the point of trying to be a Christian. Why not just live your life the way you want to, and then when people zap out of thin air, change your life. It's ridiculous and sends the wrong message. Plus, the writing is for second graders with no redeeming characteristics to it. But I really don't think the author's care at this point (seeing how many millions they've made printing lies). My recommendation is to read the bible instead of this series; then you'll get truth and the bible is probably shorter (and much better writing). Man, not even Kirk Cameron could save this train wreck. 
  Whatever else the GLTB community may find laudable about this waste of a video disk, the undeniable fact is that the cover blurbs coyly and disingenuously suggest that it is a comedy, and that is a boldfaced lie.  Featuring world famous funny man Dom DeLuise, the movie is described as what happens when he casts real life lesbians in the roles of two on-stage lesbians...and "sparks fly."  As it is, the only sparks that probably flew occurred when someone with greater sense tried to set fire to the master reels and destroy this boring piece of tripe.  From the movie's self-proclaimed description, and with DeLuise in a major role, the comic possibilities that suggest themselves to the potential viewer are endless:  Does DeLuise KNOW that the actresses are lesbians?  Do the production's other members? Does that derail the production?  What mayhem ensues?   In point of fact, however, the single attempt at "comedy" comes from DeLuise's portrayal of the director as a prissy, fastidious old queen, pampered and catered to by his boy-toy assistant each time he gets the vapors and overheats.    The bulk of the movie is essentially dull documentary monologue, as the "actresses" explain to the camera their respective experiences in being cast in the roles of on-stage lovers.  Unfortunately, there is nothing endearing or even slightly interesting about either character and the result is a great bore.  The few flashback scenes where the viewer actually sees the two characters practicing their on-stage roles under DeLuise's fevered direction come across as uncomfortably voyeuristic.  There is an inescapable feeling that the camera, the viewer, AND DeLuise, are intruders.  About the only thing that CAN be said about this film is that Director Lee Friedlander mercifully eschewed the usual Hollywood practice of casting preternaturally beautiful women in the lead roles, thereby adding at least a touch of reality to this otherwise banal effort; the lead actresses look like just any two women off the street.  Other reviewers have commented on the bad, infomercial level acting of the two lead characters.  Whether or not that is accurate depends upon whether the leads, Robin Greenspan and Lacie Harmon, are actually lesbians simply playing themselves.  If so, then this IS bad acting.  If the women are straight, however, one has to at least give them credit for convincing performances.  Sadly, there is not much other credit to be given to anything else about this film.  
 I thought the narrator was terrible. She is under the impression that people in upstate New York have southern accents.  Or maybe she never figured out where the story takes place. It must be the mint juleps that confused her. You'd think there would be an editor or coach that would notice this discrepancy, but I guess if nobody could be bothered to edit the author's work, they certainly couldn't worry about the narrator's accents 
 I bought this book about 5 years ago because I thought it would have help me out to approach  to new music, but it didn't.  It's unbelievable that one of the most important music publications could have done such a thing.  This convinces me that Rolling Stone magazine is not a publication about music, but just a publication about best selling records and artists, which are not always the best ones. I just can't believe that this editors commissioned a Pop reviewer to write about Metal, Art Rock and Progressive Rock bands.  What were they thinking? (that is if they were actually thinking). There should have been at least 12 (hopefully more) reviewers divided by genres. I would've give it one star if it wasn't for the fact that at least it gives you a "decent" list of the albums by an artist. Overall I think this is not a good purchase 
 This is not the best version available of this fairytale...Stephen Carpenter's is much better.  In this version, the illustration and text don't even match.  The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes.  I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward.  The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text.  The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't 
 A totally awesome movie when it was first released, Hawaii is based on the James A. Michener bestseller. Even at three hours plus, it still had to leave a lot of Michener's novel untouched, but the basic idea is still there. The breathtaking cinematography adds to it, as does an outstanding Elmer Bernstein score. Then there's the acting by the stars, Max Von Sydow as the missionary who goes to Hawaii to preach to the natives, and brings his own brand of religion with him. Julie Anderws is outstanding in a rare non-singing role as his wife. Richard Harris is excellent as the sea captain who is amazed that the preacher's wife turns out to be an old girlfriend. The supporting characters are just as memoriable, with an actual islander playing the queen, and also an unknown playing Keoki. All in all, take Hawaii complete, or don't take it at all. Wait until the complete version comes out on DVD. I rated it one star because of the cuts, but it is a five-star movie in its complete version 
 At the young age of 25 Julie Barenson loses her husband. Shortly after he dies, a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband. This part will give you the chills ... nice touch.  She names him Singer, and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other.   After a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss, Julie begins dating 2 men--Richard, a handsome charmer who wines & dines her, brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship. The other, Mike, is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger, Doritos & a couple beers at the local watering hole.  So who would you choose? Ouch! I'll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story.  Instead, we are faced with trite, boring, repetitive dialogue throughout, scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot.  I cannot believe this is the same author who wrote The Notebook, one of my all time favorite novels. I'll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears.  In conclusion, Singer not only saved his owner but the book as well. 
 "Raw?"  "Energetic"?  "In your face"? I honstly can't understand how anybody could think the stuff on ISM is any of those things. Energy level is close to that of "The Trinity Sessions", but this band doesn't have the self-discipline - or the vocal & instrumental skills, for that matter - of the Cowboy Junkies, so they go on & on & on & on & on ... meandering dweebishly forever.   Capsule description - high-pitched personality-free vocals that are not IMHO improved by the very free application of reverberberberb, against a background of lethargic mush. Coming soon to garage sales all over the country 
 This book was a rehash of any light or fluffy program about gays that you'd see on E! or VH-1.  I was not at all impressed by the author or the content.  There are a lot more interesting and humorous books about gays out there.  Save your money and time and buy one of them instead.  
 You can waste your time reading this book, sure. Go ahead. Or, you can pick up Henry Hazlitt's "The Failure of the New Economics: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies" and watch as an infinitely more talented writer debunks and destroys Keynes and his faulty logic. Not only does he translate the thoroughly unreadable Keynes, he shows the reader multiple instances where Keynes simply contradicts himself, yet keeps right on chuggin' (savings = investments; somehow in his General Theory, Keynes manages to both prove and disprove this). He explains in lucid terms that Keynes "General Theory" isn't "General" at all; in fact, it can only be applied correctly in static situations. In most cases it can't account at all for dynamics. Don't waste your time on this piece of socialist garbage 
 The author has provided the context in which he wrote this book.  As an adolescent boy in the 1970s, I found it an interesting read.  Since I had the good sense to not attempt any of the hare-brained schemes in the book, I am still healthy and have all of my limbs.  If people are interested in improvised munitions and the like, there are at least six (6) US Army FMs and TMs on the subject that I am aware of.  Bear in mind that the making of explosive devices is a serious felony, and should not be attempted without the proper Federal and State licenses and permits.  BATFE does not take kindly to the making of unregistered and untaxed explosives 
 I must be the only one who didn't like this book.  I felt it was written in a one-tone, endless stream of the bad events and bad people in her life.  Not one good thing or good person.  Didn't pack any emotional wallop because she didn't seem to react to the bad things that happened to her.  Now maybe she had to be that way in order to survive, but it didn't make for interesting reading.  It was hard to sympathize with her because she had no reaction herself to all these traumas.  It's unbelievable that she and her sister turned out as well as they did, but I found myself not caring about them and therefore, not caring about this book 
 Somehow I missed the part where I was informed the book was in black and white. Major disappointment. The lack of color is a big deal. Be warned. Hey don't get me wrong, I love Spider-Man. He's my favorite but I'm letting people know that the book is not in color. I would think that that would be a good thing to know before anyone buys it. 
 I found stale recounting of very well-known facts about 20th century technologies and their economics, with no insights.  Since it covers the gamut from plastics to jet engines to microprocessors, and it's only 200  pages in a fairly large typeface, I wasn't expecting historical depth.  But  I was expecting at least one fresh idea.  I bought it on the strength of a  much earlier book by Nathan Rosenberg (about technology in the economy of  the 19th century).  I was disappointed.  I get the feeling the book is  intended as a brief survey for people who just came down in the last shower  -- college freshmen born in the 1980s.  I'll bet they find it kinda stodgy 
 I have my Tivoli model 2, which I love, hooked up through an inexpensive home theater system and it sounds great.  But sometimes I want to listen to the radio without using the home theater.  The sound quality is a bit tinny so I decided to try the subwoofer to fill in the low end.  When I received the new speaker I was impressed with it's eye-appealing design.  I immediately hooked it up to the model 2 and turned it on.  I didn't hear much difference so I cranked it's volume knob up to the max.  The bass response improved, but just a little bit.  I guess I'll continue to play the radio through the $40 home theater.  In summary, the subwoofer looks great but the sound quality is disappointing 
 I was born and raised in India on the wrong side of the caste system. I worked hard to become educated and to come to America. Perhaps in the 1960s, America was not as fair as it is now, but it was still better than anywhere else. I find books like this, where people whine about the amount of melanin in their skin, offensive. Angelou comments often about how much she hates white people. This is stupid and it shows how uneducated she still is.   If she had written this in the 1960s, in the throes of it, it might be interesting as a historical piece, but now it just shows how racist she it. I'll bet she hates Asians, too. Even when she was abandoned in Egypt by a man she wrongly called her "husband," (even though they weren't married,) she wouldn't go to the American embassy for help because white people worked there. Every slight in her life, she attributes to white people being racist because she is black.   This book is filled with name-dropping and smug anger.   Minn 
 This was my first Grafton novel, and unless I take the word of a few other reviewers-that prior works in this series were much better-it will be my last.  There was essentially no plot and little character development. I agree with another reviewer, that perhaps this is what the trivial, day-to-day activities of a real-life PI might be like. I only finished it to see if at least there was an interesting twist in the solution of the case. I was disappointed to the end. 
   I bought this DVD becuase I really wanted to learn the dance moves in "You Got Served" and was extremely disappointed.  The only routines they teach you are from the people who lost the dance battles in the movie and why you would want to learn those, I don't know.  The freestlye section at the end is fun to watch, but this is neither a good workout nor a good hip hop dance video 
 Belushi's crowning jewel perfomance in my opinion is when he played opposite Monty Python's Michael Palin as the MANLY  Captain Ned in the Miles Cowperthwaite skits. They are both absent from this DVD nor on any SNL video I can find. 
 Don't be fooled by the cover  and description, this is for a magazine only & "NO DVD included', or should I say for a magazine containing mainly adverts for components and games. Waste of time and mone 
 I was forced to buy and read this book for an American History class and I KNOW some may say that I am biased because I was required to read this book, but I must say, it is absolutly horrible. As a journalism major I found this book very hard to read. Every chapter talks about the same thing.  The delegates can't decide on anything, everything is based on property and nothing is resolved. (well, until the end, obviously) Perhaps that is how the real constitutional convention happened, but i don't need to read the same thing over and over for 200 pages. Often, the author side tracks on little tid bits of personal information about the delegates that seem totally unrealted to the story at the time. Unless you are a seventy year old man, I don't think you will find this book interesting at all 
 The Gunslinger is the first book in Stephen King's Dark Tower series. It is the story of Roland Deschain's quest to find the man in black, who will lead him to the Dark Tower  On this journey, Roland travels through gritty rundown lands, often times lost in thought, reflecting on his past and all that he has lost. And thus becomes the pattern of the story. Roland travels and thinks and travels some more.  I did enjoy one childhood story in particular. He challenged his teacher and fought with a raven as his weapon. It proved that he was willing to sacrifice others, even a bird in this case, to further his own cause. This is why when we meet a young boy named, Jake, we know his fate is doomed as well.  Jake's story fascinated me. He was in New York City and the man in black ripped him from his world there and dumped him in the middle of the desert in Roland's world. He is a small glimmer of hope to an otherwise jaded story.  I had a hard time reading this book. At first I thought it was because I don't normally like western flavored stories, but my love for movies like Tombstone and shows like Deadwood have proved that's not always the case. It turns out that I just don't like the hero of the tale.  I think Jake was added to show us a softer, caring side of Roland, but it fell short. He knew he'd betray the boy from the beginning and we knew it too. Only, I wanted it to be something big when it happened. The big scene was a big let down. I remember thinking, "Wow, that's it? Please tell me that's not it."  I know heroes are not all supposed to be charmers, and I'm not one to mind if the hero is crass and ruthless. But no matter what, I found that I just didn't care about Roland or his plight or anything in his world. I couldn't attach myself to them.  What I enjoyed most in this book was reading the introduction King wrote since I always love reading when he writes about creating stories in general.  And well that's that. I have the next 4 or 5 books in this series and I haven't yet decided if I will continue it. How can I read more if I don't like the hero, eh 
 I've heard everyone go on and on about how wonderful Clare Naylor is, and I was hoping to be entertained. Yeah, well, I wasn't.   Liv's fianc dumps her and to heal herself, she takes time off her job and goes to stay with a friend (who's living in a rich-boyfriend-who's-never-there's house) in Sydney, Australia, where she has amazing, chick-litty adventures with gay men and single guys who want nothing more than a shag. Same ol', same ol'. She meets up with her very first love, Ben Parker, who is dating the Girl Everyone Wants, Amelia Fraser. He starts to fancy Liv, who then follows the advice of her gay friend James, to treat men like dogs and they'll always be begging for more. Throw in the prerequisite chick lit twists, and voil, the story.  There was a lot going on at once in this story, and it made me weary reading it. I didn't even really look forward to reading it that much once I got into it, but I wasn't going to waste all that valuable reading time, so I slogged through. I've read better 
 Plain Truth, set in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, would be better entitled, Fancy Lies. An eighteen-year-old Plain woman wakes up with labor pains, gives birth in a calving pen, cuts the umbilical cord and prays, "Lord, please make this go away." When she awakens and the baby is no longer with her, she whispers, "Denke," and goes on with her day. Later, after the deceased body of an infant is found and the police are called to investigate, she tells them "I didn't have a baby," as blood trickles down her leg. Without providing spoilers, two (of many) implausible situations follow. First, two women, one old, one young, both separately become pregnant through one act of intercourse, defying the odds of fertility. Second, a criminal defense attorney who made a name for herself getting an acquittal for an elementary school principal who molested six students is actually very maternal and willingly leaves big city life with a boyfriend of eight years to live on an electricity-free farm out of the kindness of her heart. In summary, a two-page italicized section mid-book along with the first and last chapters provide enough details of the basic plot to save the reader from 400 implausible pages. Those interested in reading just one book by Jodi Picoult should choose My Sister's Keeper. Chris Bohjalian's Midwives is better. 
 I enjoyed reading the book until about halfway through - there are a few instances of animal abuse (particularly about horses) that really bothered me, so I won't finish the rest of it because I don't know what other upsetting things might be contained in the book.  Was the author trying to illustrate the rough, tough life of the Canadian wilderness?  If so, I know I won't do any sightseeing there! If you love animals alot like I do, find something else to read 
 I think not!  As someone who has reached that stage of life where I find ritual a very valuable and reassuring aspect of life, I was completely disapointed by this book.  It should be called "Burn a Candle and  Smell Something."  Her only approach to rituals are things that the  normal populace would find just a tad suspect.  I don't need to  ritualistically burn mementos to special music by the light of a specific  colored candle while inhaling sandlewood, etc.  Genuine ritual has great  value - this just trivializes life transitions 
 Rosemary Wells' book entitled Felix Feels Better is one of our family's new favorites.  I went to the book store seeking out more of her books.  I thumbed through this one and thought it looked really cute so I bought it.  It wasn't until I got home that I read the phrase, "Nora!" said her sister, "Why are you so dumb?" repeated several times in the book.  Name calling of any kind is not practiced in our house and I was disappointed to find this in the book.  This is also not a book that my son's teacher would read in class for the same reason.  I will be returning it to the book store.  Very disappointing 
 In this movie, Gail O'Grady's character, [Jessica Gradwell] is a paralegel and a single divorced mother who just can't seem to do certain things right, like keeping her nose out of her teenage daughter Sara's business. For example, peeking through Sara's private photos, and her relationships with boys. Sara (played by Danielle Panabaker), an aspiring photographer is annoyed by her mother's faults and bitchiness and nosiness. She becomes more furious when she finds out her mother, who always denied having a "boyfriend" had a six week fling with a phony character named [Alex Lofton] (played by Grant Show), a heart surgeon involved in a malpractice suit whom Jessica was interviewing at her employ. He was also married with kids, but said he was getting a divorce (which might have been a lie). They deliberately started a relationship and deliberately had sex. Then after a while he said he was going back to his kids and left. Then Jessica found out she was pregnant, and at first denied it to Sara when Sara found a pregnancy test kit in the trash. When Jessica finally fessed up, and said she was going to have and keep the baby, Sara lashed out. She had every right to after being lied to and lectured about sex. She left the house and stayed with her father, Nick (played by Nigel Bennett) for a while, but eventually she and Jessica reconcilled their differences. Still, Jessica foolishly had the baby ( a boy unfortunately). She later decided to go to law school. This is a movie about habitual liars who get away with sexual affairs 
 This book is awful.  I read it, and I couldn't wait to finish it.  I would have flipped it in the trash can except I had to read it for school.  The characters are pathetic, there is no grasp of dialogue, and the author admits that it is the same thing as an F. Scott Fitzgerald book that was already written.  How it became a Newberry winner I will never know 
 For all of you looking for that favorite book "The Silly Book", join my club (not literally).  The book that has the ode to Boodleheimer was written by Stoo Hample not Babette Cole.  I have been searching for this book for years.  Good luck everyone, and let me know if you find an extra copy for sale 
 Well I am a fan of The Rugrats, those babies are so cute so I watched this movie and though the movie had a couple of funny parts it was only marginally and it's mostly a boring movie and just way too loud and obnoxious and doesn't live up the the hoopla it received from critics and doesnt live up to the Nickeleodeon TV show!  If you want to get a splitting headache than watch this movie but if you dont want to get a splitting headache from all the loud noises in this movie that avoid like the plague!  Watch the TV show instead. The original episodes and not the new ones with the horrible Dil and Kimmie who totally ruined the Rugrats 
 The Unnameable explains himself as aporetic [being unable to act] and ephectic [being unable to make a decision].  From 1929, in "Che Sciagura", to 1989 Beckett's prose becomes more and more aporetic.  From "Lessness" in 1970 to Ill Seen Ill Said in 1981 to Worstword  Ho in 1983, aporia dominates the prose style and the thematic content. All  of Beckett's tiny, bizarre stories - "Imagination Dead Imagine"  [one paragraph], "The Lost Ones", "Enough",  "Ping", Fizzles [eight one-paragraph stories] - they all contain  catatonic characters, paralyzed by mental ambivalence.

 Expecting sexy camp in the tradition of "Beyond Valley of the Dolls" I was really looking forward to seeing this film. Instead I struggled through this tedious, repetitive, and confusing mess of a film. I respect what the director was trying to create, but the end product is nearly unwatchable. It's starts out so well too.... "I tried not to remember why I buried my trumpet." ...but then it quickly dives into a psychosexual pseudo-sado-vampire ghost story that isn't the least bit sexy or interesting. I know this film has a sizeable cult following. It is pretty to look at (sometimes when it isn't in grainy slow-motion) but I just couldn't make it through. Maybe it's worth a look, but I personally wish I had rented it 
          I took the time to write this review because I consider Hector Lavoe to have been one of the best soneros ever ("son" is the original Cuban name to what was later called salsa; therefore, salsa singers are most times called soneros). Lavoe was not much of a composer, but was an extremely versatile original singer with a voice and timbre hard to match. This combined with great composers, writers, and orchestras; meant that "most" of the productions Hector Lavoe was in were worth the time, there was a collaboration of talent from everyone.   Lavoe started and became famous under the Fania label as the singer for the famous trumpet player Willie Colon and his band, they started in the late 60s and separated in early 80s. All those Willie Colon records made with Lavoe around the 1970s are landmarks in salsa history as well as some of Lavoe's solo pieces in the 80s. The image created around this two was to make them the bad boys of salsa. They had like a mature streetwise tone to them, in terms of music and lyrics; some songs were danceable, sad, instrumental, etc. In other words, they had musical substance: and for such, they usually were the top sellers in the label.  Why the low score here? The Fania label did millions during its LP era but during the CD era this music was horribly marketed and packaged (just a picture of the album cover, no info, no back art, and hard to find outside niche markets). So in 2006 as soon as the Fania repackaged and re-mastered CDs started to come out this album was one I was waiting for, I was curious to hear "Periodico de Ayer" (yesterdays newspaper) one of Lavoe's most (if not the most) original, memorable, instrumental, and famous classic re-mastered after so long. I was waiting for a more vibrant and dispersed sound. Boy oh boy, was I disappointed and surprised. Not only did it sound noticeable worst than the one on the old CD "Hector's Gold", I was surprised that [...] would be released in the first place. This sounded horrible and I mean it. It sounded like something they took out of an 8-track cassette that was taking sun inside a Chevrolet since the 70s and then sold in a flea market for 25 cents, please get the picture because it's not an exaggeration. It sounded baaaddd and it is a farce to call such thing re-mastered, please.   If you have the original then there is not much point in this, aside the booklet, and if you don't then I strongly recommend trying to get the now out of print "Hecto's Gold" which is the only other album to date that contains "Periodico de Ayer" with its original acceptable quality. Hector's Gold leaves a lot out but has "El Cantante" and "Periodico de Ayer" and trust me, just for that, is worth it especially if you are going to have only one Lavoe CD.  I have many of these new Fania re-mastered CDs including others from Lavoe and Willie Colon, I can tell you that the early ones they took out were very inconsistent, some sounded great and vibrant, some others were questionable in comparison to the original CDs of the early 90s, but this one sadly is the one that just takes it a higher label of mediocrity. It was later that they got their act together. They have been informed of this but who knows if they will do anything about it.   Sadly Hector died in 1993, Willie Colon is alive and kicking but his new music is not. There were people behind that music that are not around anymore. Most of the Salsa being done these days is not worth a cent. All this great Puerto Rican, Cuban & Dominican artists that created the Salsa movement of the 70s in N.Y. with the Fania label grew up in the era when Cuba was the #1 in tropical music and was extremely influential. Cuban culture is the real mother of "Salsa", but under its long(over due) tyrannical communist government Cuba is by now almost as dead and destroyed as Lavoe's flesh. If it was not for the Dominican Johnny Pacheco who started the Fania label, and the Puerto Ricans in N.Y. that took the music, elaborated, and prolonged its existence, this music would have died before it did: Right in Havana clubs in the early 60s instead of in N.Y.C. clubs in the early 80s. This Fania guys were for the 60s & 70s what the Grammy winner Buena Vista Social Club was for the 40s & 50s, just the best among their era. I also recommend everything Lavoe did along with Willie Colon and also the albums La Lupe- Es la Reina, Cheo Feliciano- Cheo, Joe Battan- Saint Latin's Day Massacre, Tito Puente, etc, you can go on from there. Check the Fania site and the Descarga site. Also the Hector Lavoe movie "El Cantante" due summer of 2007. It could be worth it, lets hope so. 
 Simply said, this book is far too general to be of any use.  It makes the case that there is such a thing as body language, and that it can be read, and that it is very useful, but it does not teach you anything on how to read body language.  If I were you I wouldn't bother reading this book. 
 I found this book a truly disapointment !! When i started the book , the story of Abby and Lucian was so intense , so passionate that i thought i was going to love it . Then the book advances to this days with the story of Declan and Lena , and it was ugelly disapointing !! They don't have anything in commun with Abby and Lucian !! Lena and Declan , they don't work as a couple in love ; to me they was no chemestry or anything between them . I only read the book till the end because i wanted to know how it was going to end with Abby and Lucian , but that too was a little beyond what i thought it was going to be , they deserv a better ending , i don't now how but that was not what i expected ! 
 The first 6 dragonlance books (Chronicles and Legends Trilogies) remain for me, the greatest works in Fantasy ever written.  The poor rating I give to this volume is due only to the useless commentary that I so hoped would provide insight into the story.    What the authors merely do is provide offhand comments that either repeat themselves or detail things that I found uninteresting.  I was seeking more detail into what Raistlin had experienced in his journey, ie..what actually went on when Soth and Raistlin first encountered each other in Shoiken Grove.  What did Raistlin face when he entered the Abyss and battled the Dark Queen's army.  Why did the mage council simply not kill Raistlin outright.  Why did the Dragonlance Adventures book have such inappropriate stats for the characters involved in this story.  Alas, none of these were answered 
  I purchase a lot of educational videos on photography and Photoshop, but this one was not at all what I expected.  It has little, if any, educational value.  Instead, the video shows photos taken by French photographers with commentary (in French).  Don't buy this as an educational video.  
 Because you can't give negative stars, I'll give this product one star.  I bought this product instead of the AbLounge because it could actually support a plus sized weight.  I'm glad this product was cheap, because it was the worst exercise machine I ever bought.  Everytime I swing on it, I feel it creak and wobble. I feel like its going to break under me each time I use it.  It makes a better decoration then it does an exerciser.  I've been useing it for a few months, and all its done is make me feel akward.  Don't buy this product if your plus size.  If your not plus size, go get the 210 lbs weight limited Ab Lounger Jack Knife System thing.  If your are of plus size, order THE BEAN full body (I just did) 
 After moving to CA from CO, and having used Colorado 14er guidebooks by Dawson and Roach, I was disappointed by this book. While there are many fine photographs, wonderful climbing history of the peaks, a slew of routes, and many routes superimposed on photographs, there were many elements that I find essential, that were missing. Topographic maps of the areas in question (with routes drawn on them), round trip distance information, elevation gain, and an estimated (conservative) completion time are essential pieces of information when planning a trip, and are not included here. While the difficulties of the various routes are described well, these other descriptors would make the book twice as good as it is now. Dawson's format, at the beginning of each route description, listing the aforementioned deficiencies (with the exception of the maps) is excellent. From the guidebooks I've looked at though, this is the best available 
 I had tried this for my newborn and I think this product is unsafe and not sturdy.  The base of the seat is very wobbley, it would help to have suction cups on the bottom.  And  you do have to fill your tub about half way in order for your child to stay warm.  Also, when I put my baby in the seat and he is 12 lbs, the seat tipped backwards.  I can imagine that it would be worse when my child is heaviear and moves around more.  I do not think this product is safe.  It would make a great product if they included a baby tub with it.  So I returned the product and ended up with the 4-in-1 bath station from Safety First that worked well with my first child 
 The reviews  in the press made this sound like a great book. It was NOT. Clearly the author is well connected as he was able to get his friends to rave about this book was a jumble of anecdotes about future high tech possibilities that may or may not have any relevance to your health and certainly not to personalized medical care which is what we all wish for. Not worth reading in my opinion.  
 Bigoted and racist title for a book about talented blacks, their deserving of a more honorable title since they were called these racist nicknames all their lives and had to be these stereotypes to show their talent, but he can get away with naming a book as he has this one because he's Black, I'm sure if a white did the same, the NAACP will jump on him. Bogle suppose to lift Blacks up not put them down.  Here's a long but informative review! Naturally since Bogle is the only one writing about early Black film stars people believe everything he says. He plays it safe by always talking about the same ole' stars that he talked about in his last books. Never does he introduce the public to unsung talents we never heard of. He spends most of the time talking about how mulatto, how light or how dark such and such is and how such and such couldn't do this or that because of this or that. When whites write on their stars they don't write about how blonde, how brunette or how red head someone was and how Irish or Italian one looked. Which proves how stuck on skin color Blacks really are! Why do Blacks feel they always have to spend time talking about race instead of giving these stars their recognition and due, forgetting how they look and telling of their life and versatile careers, who they really were, where they come from, making one reading feel like they knew the person all their lives, make one feel the happiness and sadness. Bogle spends more time on what they didn't do then what they did do. Which is sad, the public is missing out on a lot. So again, do for yourself the research and don't' depend on others all the time.  Bogle loves talking about how white Fredi Washington looked instead of writing about her extensive, incredible career, she done more in her life then most of us could dream about it, she didn't let others prejudices hold her back. She was no tragic mulatto, another stupid name, minus well call Stepin Fetchit a tragic ni**er which he wasn't, he was the first black millionaire and no more of a stereotype then Black pimps, gangsters of today who are getting rich off of it like Step got rich off of his stereotype. Fredi will be the first to say she had a great life and career. She wasn't sad or confused but a strong black woman. Bogle is no better than a white writer who puts down a black but thinks its okay to coin a book Toms, Coons, Mulattoes, Mammies and Bucks because he's black, I'm sure if a white titled a book that we be yelling racism, don't Black talents deserve a better title?   Bogle also plays it safe by always talking about Lena Horne and Dorothy Dandridge, never telling the stories and never giving recognition to other black actresses like Nina Mae McKinney, Mildred Washington, Theresa Harris, Fredi Washington, Edna Mae Harris, Florence O'Brien, Louise Franklin, Daisy Bufford, Jeni LeGon Evelyn Preer, Suzette Harbin, Hilda Simms, Francine Everett, Shirley Haven and countless of others who had a chance to display their talents on the screen in Hollywood and helped fight discrimination and  help in the enhancement and betterment of blacks on screen but he gives all the credit to Horne and Dandridge, who didn't do as much as others if you want to get down to the truth, but I'm glad he don't talk about them in a way because he'll butcher up their life stories, I'll give them their due though. Many aren't remembered because maybe they didn't do as much, who cares about who has done more, were suppose to be remembering them for accomplishments and talents, right? White film historians sure remember all their stars, little or big. Someone like Louise Brooks, considered a early Hollywood icon is highly regarded as a great actress despite she only had a few good films and wasnt a big movie star. The woman is more remembered for one good film and a bobbed hairstyle but white historians will make sure you know her, her achievements and what she DID DO for the film industry.  Why can't Bogle be like that instead of criticizing everyone and judging them by white people's standards of what success and beauty is? I guess it's true that you gotta work twice as hard as whites to be someone in this world, whites can be remembered for little things, few successes, Blacks gotta have many successes to get rememberance and recognition even for other Blacks to remember them. Bogle is one of the few black film historians, you would think he would write more positively of blacks in Hollywood but he treats many worse then whites treated them when they were alive. Bogle never mentions Willie Covan and Marie Bryant (and appeared in movies also and was a good friend of Lena Horne's too) who choreograhed many white stars, they were behind the scenes but contributed to Hollywood. He suppose to be giving credit not taking away. Either Bogle is too lazy or likes to show favoritism because he sure won't tell other unsung talents stories. If he does he clutter it up with talking about their looks especially if he doesn't know how to write about them. Bogle knows nothing about the great career of Nina Mae McKinney, the first movie star of Hollywood and Europe, who done more films then any other black actress of her time, the first to appear on many magazines, she had so many achievements, yet he gives her one little page, if you don't know about a person, I rather you not write about them at all then to write lies. He never talks about the Black Cinema independent movie stars or the industry who was apart of American cinema, I guess their too hard for him to research, so he takes the easy path in writing about stars he already wrote about a million times. He never writes about Ethel Moses, Francine Everett, Dorothy Van Engle, Edna Mae Harris, Margaret Whitten, Tomiwitta Moore, Bee Freeman, Lorenzo Tucker, Monte Hawley, Ralph Cooper (created the first black studio in Hollywood), Oscar Micheaux, Spencer Williams and countless other black movie stars who appeared in films for blacks made by blacks in the 30's and 40's, I guess that's too mediocre for him but they done more for the enhancement of Blacks in movies by creating their own images, own roles, own portrayals, playing people from all walks of life unlike ones in Hollywood who were stuck playing the same types of roles and being the same images he always complaining about well I feel give due to ones who at least tried to do for themselves and become what they wanted but see they weren't cross-overs so their looked at as non-important by some which kind of dictated by whites who we should remembered and who's important. It's hard researching Black Cinema stars but boy it's worth it plus studying them, watching them perform gives you a good idea of who they were even if you can't find info on them. I still find the time to give them due and I'm no professional or anything but Bogle is a high class guy who only likes to write about Hollywood and his favorite gals Horne and Dandridge.   Ive done more research on unsung, forgotten stars then he has and it has been pleasurable teaching others on the net about blacks who contributed to stage and screen, stars who were just as important as Dandridge and Horne. I'm glad there are other people who are taking it upon themselves to tell the true stories of many unsung black legends and don't write in the same fashion as Bogle. Anyone who is hung up on skin color and don't want to think outside the box and like to hear the same stories then Bogle is for you but someone like me who researched many early black stars of stage and screen on my own and found out the real deal, found how they really were, found how they were really looked at, and found the true stories wouldn't appreciate Bogle's work much. I've talked with some legendary Blacks of the early years, some of their relatives also and they gave a completely different view then how Bogle describes them which shows he just goes by hearsay and documents and don't do accurate interviewing and researching.  I would think Bogle would spend more time on talking about the beauty of  black women from dark to light and  their wonderful achievements to the world.  Black women are quite unique but instead Bogle tells the  story of black women from white people's perspective it seems, he tells how black women were looked at from whites perspective not from a true black person's perspective that has pride for his race, maybe Bogle has a white person's way of thinking who is partial. Because I would commend these women, embrace and make the world embrace their beauty, courage, and talents; their many gifts to the world isn't as nearly written about as their skin tones are. He loves spending time writing about how light, dark or mulatto someone looks. Again, he makes it seem like such and such suffered because she was mulatto, light or dark, come on man, if she had a tragic life it was her own fault if she suffered. He makes it seem like color and race was the problem for everything which is false, actually many of these women profited from the race sometimes and plus women in general face discrimination, no matter what race or color. Don't you think these women went through enough being judged by skin tone or looks, they wished in their life for being to judge their talent, at least give them that now, Bogle doesn't. Who isn't discriminated against in this world? Bogle makes it look like Black is a curse when these female performers change the world and introduce the world to their greatness and the greatness of the race. He loves talking about whether someone should of passed for white or not like when he's talking about the great Fredi Washington. He misses out on showcasing  other great talents like Valaida Snow, Blanche Calloway, Una Mae Carlisle, Eunice Wilson, Adelaide  Hall and  others but that's okay because they have  been written  beautifully about by other writers. Well, many are dead so they cant stick up for themselves and Bogle takes advantage of that, he hasn't even interviewed or actually talked to ones who he writes about, he just goes by hearsay. Have your favorites but when you write a book, you can't show favoritism which he does all through which hurts others who has a story to tell but he only give honor to his faves. It seems no black can make him happy, he always has something to criticize. In his words every Black woman is a tragic, confused mulatto and every black man is a coon, or some other stereotype, he wouldn't say that to the young black guys or gals in entertainment today though, he takes advantage of the dead who can't stick  up for themselves.  There is a website on unsung black talents of stage and screen, you all will enjoy. http://www.angelfire.com/jazz/ninamaemckinney/ 
 "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and dog-gone-it, people like me." That seems to encapsulate Ms. Vanzant's approach to spirituality.  I don't know about anybody else, but when I look inside myself, I see that despite my best intentions and genuine desire to be "good," I often act in ways that trouble my own conscience. Ms. Vanzant's assertion that this stems from the fact that I have not yet really embraced my God-ness leaves me troubled, empty, and confused.   The fact is that it doesn't really matter if one's soul "opens up."  The question is what is one's soul opened up to?  If you are looking for a book that will tell you what you want to hear about spirituality (that you are a god, that there's nothing essentially wrong with humanity, that evil comes only from lack of enlightenment, that everything that you need to be fulfilled is already inside of you, etc.), then this is the book for you.  But if you're looking for a book that deals  realistically with the problem of evil, with human nature, and with what it means to grapple with both a human and a spiritual  nature, then don't give this book a second look.  I believe Ms. Vanzant's book is an insult to the reality, the severity, and the complexity of the human condition 
 For such a serious subject matter, I was surprised and even curious that the author's bio or expertise is regulated to the back of the paperback book in one sentence. The other two sentences are related to media appearance and praise. (Choosing not to Google her, I read the book anyways).  note: the quotes are from the book.  On page 35 and 150 a bookmercial was introduced for another of the author's book instead of discussions on why the subject matter would be a trait or characteristic of a controlling person.   On page 71-74 two separate stories explaining a concept "defining .. were a way of connecting". The stories did not indicated how long a "stranger" had to be in your presence before such a concept could be triggered. If these people were at the same convention that the author attended, how long was the presentation, did she see them at the convention, did she talk to those two people in a question and answer session, or were they just the fans?  At what point does the switch get triggered in the stranger's action for them to feel comfortable in crossing the "psychic boundary".  on page 165 I think the author missed an opportunity to share a control type situation outside a "couple or parent relationship". ie "I'm your therapist. You should follow my advice." IMHO Lea was also attracting people into her life who wanted to control her in addition to her relationship with Vic.    Lastly, on page 288-290 you can participate in a survey geared for "Spell bound" issues for the Patricia Evans, Evans Interpersonal Communications Institute.  There isn't any background on what the Insitutes does or is even mentioned in the book.  IMHO I would not recommend this book to anyone. I can see why many readers would feel a connection with the book.  There are several stories that a person would relate to if they were in a controlling relationship, but I step back and think about how can a person get pointers on when the control activity begins to occur. Do you have to wait several years or  decades to figure out that the relationship has a problem in it. I think there are always warning signals. ie on p 29 when "Ted ... was beside himself." 
 This item looks great in theory, but it just isn't worth it. The pegs are made in all different sizes - some fall out, some don't fit in, and some stick out too far, leaving you with a messy look to your lite art. One of the crayons for the neon was broken when received, but it didn't matter, since it just looked like a regular crayon drawing on black paper anyway. If you do buy this item, be sure to purchase that 25w light bulb that isn't even included 
 As a sales pitch for Tellington Touch, this book is great. As an instruction manual, it is totally worthless. Complex gestures such as those mentioned in the book need illustrations that take one step-by-step through the manipulation process. There aren't any, just a few photos that show one stop action part of the whole.   It did get me to take a T-Touch workshop, which was beneficial for my old and arthritic dog. The process works. The book doesn't 
 I love Ford harrison movies and this is not a bad story but the film is shot in such dark showdy lighthing by the cinematographer that it is unwatchable that it ruins the film and all the acting, directing and writing in it. 
 This book is pretty much standard for undergrad analytical chemistry but it is not a great text.  It provides a very basic introduction to analytical methods in a poorly organised fashion.  The information is presented in such a way that it calls for you to memorize rather than understand.  The mathematics presented confuse the reader more than they help.  I recommend you buy this used.  If you plan on pursuing analytical chemistry, this book will quickly be shoved aside to make way for much better books, each specific to a particular instrumental method 
 basically Wilber's philosophy is: there are people out there who are stuck in their cultural conceptions. In other words, some people are closed minded. Some people need to open their minds to other's views and allow themselves to grow a little. This confirms Wilbur's own admission as to why he really is not accepted in academia: he is not really saying anything of substance. Not only has he admitted this but he followed it up with saying that's why he took his message to the people. Of course, the average joe will eat this stuff up as though it is a step toward enlightenment. Dont bother with this guy...he seems too full of himself

 I can't speak for the knitting instruction chapters, as I know how to knit and skipped those parts, but the patterns in this book are FUGLY.    I bought this thinking it would have some great patterns for my teen nieces - WRONG!  The patterns are just plain awful.  Knit a fake cactus?  Yeah, that's on every young hipster's list.  How about an egg cozy?  Or a cozy for individual apples or bananas?    There is a pattern for a safety pin sweater, knit with intentional holes and uses safety pins across the holes, all in a horrendous yellow/brown striped combo.  Ugh.  This is NOT cutting edge shabby fashion, it's just plain bad.  Or maybe you might like to knit up the mini-dress with lace edging...modeled on a young girl wearing pink and black striped tights.  Yeah, if you want your daughter to go out looking like a hooker, go for it.  Knitted KNEE PADS?  For BOYS?  With a brown center and powder blue/brown stripes radiating from the center?  Seriously.  What "hip young" teen boy is going to wear this?  One who wants to get beat up at the skate park.  There are a couple of patterns that are okay.  For example, fingerless gloves.  Of which there are plenty of free patterns available on the internet,  minus the unfortunate green/white striping.  There is a cute slipper pattern, that my nieces might wear around the house.  Um, yeah, that's about it for the "okay" category.  Skip this book.  I really try to be supportive of the people who put out knitting books, but dang, this one is bad.  "Hip Young Things" will not want to either own or knit the overwhelming majority of these patterns.  I feel a responsibility to warn other people not to waste their money on this book.  I'm sending my copy back 
 Digital photography is all about color.  Why would any publisher release a book on the manipulation of color images in Photoshop with mostly black and white examples?  Save your mone 
 I get this book 'coz the original articles were really cool, I mean, you can get actually hot-tips from "real" comic book creators, and after years and years of waiting for wizard to finally collect the articles, the comic book magazine, changed most of them to FIT with a deal with marvel, so many of the most good articles were left out and the few that made it, were changed to ONLY show marvel characters!, this situation caused the book look crappy!!!, I don't know if wizard plans to put another compilation with the articles that did not made it in this volumen, but if this is true I hope this time they RESPECT the originals and do not try to change them just because any stupid deal with an editorial; this book is just another one like many others about the drawing subject 
 Having visited the Chicago Big Bowl for years when I lived there, I decided I have missed my favourite dish so much, that I bought this book. Their signature dish was the Kung Pao Chicken, which I adored. I received the book today, and was absolutely amazed...there was no recipe for Kung Pao chicken, although the dish was mentioned in the preface. They do have Kung Pao Fish, but the ingredients differ greatly. Where is the recipe for the chicken! Plus, the number of photos is a token effort. Every good cook book should have photos of the dishes - this has hardly any. Too early to tell how the other recipes will shape up, but very disappointed at the moment 
 I could not stand this book. It used verbs like it was going out of style. It tries to make you believe that you're about to embark upon an amazing adventure of learning where discoveries will lead to ultimate fulfillment and success :) . It's 75% fluff to make you believe that all life problems will be solved if only you could learn how to learn. It was like Anthony Robbins wrote it. Motivational B.S.. Some of it was good, if you siffed long enough you could get a couple gold flakes out of this one, that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of a deserving 1. But it was so anoying in how it was written. It was so bad I had a hard time paying attention. Awful motivational and persuasive [stuff]. Do waste you money buying this. .. 
 "The Burning" was a big letdown after reading Bentley Little's masterful book, "Dispatch".  I seriously considered that this book might be written by someone else while Bentley was ill and couldn't write.  Who knows.  I love this guy and can't tell you how disappointed I was.  While one of the top 5 horror writers working today, Bentley Little seems to be hit or miss with his stories.  I simply just did not enjoy reading this new release.  It seemed that he was throwing way too much random horror at the reader and hoping some of it would stick.  And, with everything he was trying to do, none of it - not one moment - was scary!  Shadow creatures performing random oral sex, creeping fungus, talking voices in the microwave, deformed goblins peering in windows, skeletons climbing out of mud pits, tunnels filled with moving corpses, and a runaway ghost train crashing into the White House was just too silly.  It reminded me of his previous work, "The Return", another disappointment containing silly, bizarre, and unrealistic situations.      The scenes of horror during the first third of the book were described during the daytime hours and lost its scare value, suspense, and atmospheric quality.  The book had many problems that pulled me out of the story.  One of those problems was how ridiculous it was that the police would allow a field trip to a tunnel of bodies that had just been discovered earlier that same day. Bentley needs to do what he does best, which is to come up with a gimmick, focus everything on that single idea, and continue to build suspense around it using his original and obsessed style of storytelling.  It worked with "The Store", "The Association", "The Policy", and "Dispatch", just to name a few.  Let's hope he gets back on track with his next book. 
 Obviously both and Finnegan proves it. Joyce spent seventeen years on this book, which can be properly read and understood by only one person - James Joyce, who passed away in 1941.  Now if you'd like to devote yourself - and perhaps your life - to achieving an understanding of Finnegans Wake, you are certainly free to do so.  And, having once attempted  to achieve such understanding myself, I can assure you that some of your time will be well spent.  But the facts are as follows:  1. Joyce was fluent in a number of European languages and had a nodding acquaintance with many more.  2. From this knowledge he fashioned a special vocabulary of multilingual blends and puns which he used, with ordinary English syntax, to create the solipsistic discourse of Finnegans Wake. It is, in effect, a private language.  3. Since most of his vocabulary is drawn from, and puns on, the languages Joyce was familiar with, the only way one can begin to understand what's happening is to be as familiar with them as James Joyce.   4. The entire book is said to narrate the mostly incoherent nighttime dream of its antihero, "HCE."  This was Joyce's way of "getting at" (whatever that means here) some sort of unconscious European cultural mind - as apprehended and imagined by James Joyce, of course.  5. Finnegans Wake is thus basically incomprehensible. The explications in Campbell & Robinson's Skeleton Key, while well informed, are, as the authors admit (though not in these words) the only sense they could make of it with the assistance of a shelf full of reference books. By getting in on the ground floor, C & W effectively dared anyone to disagree.  Which would, of course, require another pair of literature Ph.D.'s with another shelf of reference books. There can be more than one interpretation of Finnegans Wake, including a belief in the profitlessness of interpretation.   6. Once in a while Joyce can still write a melodious sentence that is close enough to English to carry some meaning. As readers of Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, and Ulysses are aware, Joyce was at one time a master of poetic English prose. Searching for the poetic moments, and those alone, makes for a pleasant diversion, and will undoubtedly reward the extremely well read and knowledgable.  If you're still intrigued, your best bet is to find a copy of the drastically abridged edition with commentary that Anthony Burgess put out forty years ago.  Burgess loved Finnegans Wake in the Campbell-Robinson interpretation, and he supplies enough editorial matter to aid you in your innocent quest to believe in Finnegans' greatness. The book may be  useful to some as a kind of Rorschach/I Ching for your own creativity: "How many puns and themes can *I* find?"  This book allegedly turned Derrida into a Deconstructionist. I believe it. Students of OCD and associated disorders should take a look at the entire Finagin Fannomenikonn, if you know what I mean.  
 One reviewer said this filter does not work in all Krups 10-12 coffee makers--as advertised.  What's up with this, Krups 
 "Wool and Nylon Blend?"  It is impossible to be a responsible consumer if you do not know what you are buying.  My poor review is based on this.  In my opinion technology has yet to replace the abilities of natural materials like wool and silk.  Of course, this is only my opinion and preference.  However, when manufactures refuse to inform and the buyer with more than "Wool and Nylon Blend?" there is no mechanism to a consumer to make an informed choice or even purchase what they are looking for.  Stretch nylon is certainly nice for form fit and ease when it comes to slipping your foot onto your sock and into your boot.  BUT - if too much nylon is present it will show its downside should the hiker or hunter find themselves in a wet situation and hiking for long periods.  It would seem that the age of the 100% wool sock is almost gone and I accept my fate, but I urge people to NOT buy a sock, which does not disclose the details of its manufacture.  The review reflects on "full disclosure in advertising" and not the product itself.  Should Amazon find it inappropriate then a deletion is understandable. 
 As a big proponent of a manned mission to Mars, I looked forward to reading this book.  While Baxter's characters showed a lot of promise, the slow pace of the story and lack of any possible conflict failed to keep my interest 
 We bought our daughter this little giggle phone thinking that Sesame Street would be a trusted vendor that would use the highest quality materials to construct the toy.  Our child put the toy in her mouth once and chewed on it a little bit (as many kids do)....and we noticed that the paint on the eyes had immediately scraped off.  We took that toy away and haven't given it back.  We just wanted to let others out there know that despite the age recommendation, if there is any chance your child might put the toy in their mouth, then this is not the toy for you 
 STOP putting artists that 2pac would have probablynever worked with on his songs! I don't understand why people think these dumb beats and radio rap artists are gonna do justice to a pac album. Haha this cd is SO bad! Afeni needs to let Suge Knight produce the cds like on Better Dayz. He knew 2pac and has a good grasp of his style. These people never even met him. Might as well let Biz Markie on the albums. Whatever I'm over it. RIP Pac sorry they're putting this gay stuff out with your name on it it's too bad. I'm surprised Akon isn't on here. Ashanti....WOW....have DRE or SUGE produce...no one else.
