## TODO

Depending on weather I decide to keep this repository public post marking, the following things need to be fixed:

- Fix scripts to take input args / not make assumptions
- Create proper docs / refactor comments
- Include instructions for replication / create run scripts for vader and data preprocessing
- Automate statistical testing
